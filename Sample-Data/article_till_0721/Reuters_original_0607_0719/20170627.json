The left-hander accepted the decision but later said,  Never,  when asked if he wanted to come out of the game. In the end, it all worked out.  He probably didn't want to come out of that game,  Boston manager John Farrell said after his Red Sox defeated the Minnesota Twins 4-1 in the first of four games between the contenders Monday night. Farrell had his reasons. Sale was at 108 pitches. With Boston ahead 2-1 and runners on first and second with one out in the seventh, Chris Gimenez came to the plate. Gimenez homered off Sale in the third inning and was 4-for-8 with two homers against the Boston ace. Heath Hembree came on, induced a double-play grounder, and Matt Barnes and Craig Kimbrel were perfect in the eighth and ninth to seal the win.  For some reason, certain hitters see some pitchers better than others,  Farrell said.  It's a small number of at-bats by Gimenez, but he's seen (Sale) well, and there's been some extra-base production in there. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at Red SoxMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatch I felt like that was a spot where he's coming to the end of the line, 110 pitches into the ninth inning just five days ago, the way Gimenez had swung the bat a couple of at-bats previous. ... Heath comes in and makes a key cutter pitch.  The double play was started by Tzu-Wei Lin, making his debut at third base for the Red Sox. Boston will continue, as Farrell says,  mixing and matching  at the position. The loss dropped the surprising Twins a half-game behind the Cleveland Indians in the American League Central. Minnesota (39-35) had its three-game winning streak stopped. The Red Sox (42-34) remain percentage points behind the New York Yankees in the AL East. Sale (10-3) worked 6 1/3 innings of one-run ball to go to 9-1 since April 27. He walked two and struck out nine, yielding four hits.  There's a couple of things I could have done to extend my outing, but in the end, it worked out,  Sale said.  Heater (Hembree) really picked me up.  Boston's Mitch Moreland hit a solo homer and sacrifice fly, taking over the team's RBI lead with 41, while Dustin Pedroia drove in a run with a single, one of his two hits. Barnes, who has been struggling, cashed in on some adjustments he made on the side to strike out the side on 11 pitches in the eighth, and Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 21st save. The Red Sox, who scored two in the first off Jose Berrios (7-2) and added on two in the seventh off Berrios and two relievers, won for the second time in five games. The Twins lost for the second time in their past six. Berrios gave up four runs on eight hits and two walks in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out seven.  I was proud of how Jose hung in there,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  He kept us in the game and we battled, we got a homer to cut it in half and had an opportunity there to at least tie the game, and we didn't get it done and they were able to tack on.  Molitor was not pleased with a strike call against a squaring Jorge Polanco with two on and nobody out in the seventh. Polanco appeared to have pulled his bat back on an inside pitch, only to have first base umpire Jeff Kellogg call a strike. Polanco wound up striking out as Sale's last batter.  I thought it was a huge call. I'm not sure what Jeff saw,  Molitor said.  You square around and the pitch is coming at your leg -- it's not that easy to move the bat and get out of the way at the same time. It was an obvious non-attempt from the way I saw it, and it changed the at-bat.  Moreland homered, his 12th, off Berrios after a double play grounder scored the first run. Moreland then followed Pedroia's RBI single with his sac fly in the seventh. He has knocked in 15 runs during a 16-game home on-base streak. Moreland has homered in three straight games for the second time this season.  He's become kind of a bedrock in our lineup,  Farrell said. The homer was only the second off Berrios since May 24, leading to the right-hander's first June loss after four wins. Berrios had won seven of his first eight starts and had yielded two runs in each of his four June starts -- all wins. Left fielder Eddie Rosario made three nifty catches to help keep the Twins in the game. NOTES: Red Sox DH Hanley Ramirez was out with a bruised left knee sustained when he was hit by a pitch Sunday. ... Twins 1B Joe Mauer got the night off as a starter, coming on late -- manager Paul Molitor resting him with the Red Sox throwing three straight lefties. ...

The move would cause a huge problem for the state, which has accumulated a $15 billion bill backlog due to a budget stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. It could force Illinois to stop making full payments on other state-mandated or court-ordered spending such as pensions and payroll.  The filing in U.S. District Court by attorneys representing Medicaid recipients asked Judge Joan Lefkow to order the state to pay $500 million a month for four months to start reducing a $3.1 billion pile of unpaid bills owed to managed care organizations that turn pay doctors and others.  As long as Illinois remains without an enacted budget, the proposed order calls for the state to spend an additional $586 million a month to cover Medicaid-related bills incurred after June 30, 2017.    The proposed order noted that eventual federal Medicaid reimbursements would reduce Illinois' monthly outlay to $543 million. The two sides are scheduled to appear on Wednesday before Lefkow, who previously ruled Illinois' minimal payments to managed care organizations did not comply with federal consent decrees that resulted from two cases filed against the state in 1992.  The judge had ordered negotiations aimed at getting Illinois to  substantial  compliance with the decrees, noting the state has managed to make its monthly bond and pension payments on time and in full. [nL1N1JG1J2] Monthly payments related to the Medicaid and other consent decrees have totaled only about $160 million. [nL1N1J30SL] In the wake of Lefkow's order, Illinois general obligation bond prices plummeted and yields soared in municipal market trading, although the bonds subsequently clawed back some losses. The state comptroller last week pledged to not delay or diminish bond payments.  Illinois Attorney General spokeswoman Eileen Boyce said the filing is under review  in light of the state's ongoing severe fiscal crisis.   Rauner ordered lawmakers back into a special session, which began June 21 and is scheduled to end on Friday, to pass a budget before fiscal 2018 begins on Saturday.

GLOBAL MARKETS     • The S&P; 500 and the Dow closed up slightly Monday but a fall in technology stocks nudged the Nasdaq lower as investors turned to more defensive sectors.      • Japanese stocks closed in on two-year highs thanks to a weaker yen while the euro sagged against its peers after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi talked up benefits of the ECB's easy monetary policy.      • The dollar stood tall, pushing to a one-month high against the yen as investors waited to see if Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen would stick to her positive economic outlook at an event later in the global session.     • Long-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields dropped to seven-month lows on Monday and the yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds fell to its flattest level since 2007 after weak U.S. economic data raised concerns about tepid growth and falling inflation.     • Crude oil futures were largely unchanged as the market took a breather following three days of gains with a supply glut keeping a lid on prices.     • Gold edged down on a firmer dollar ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, which may give clues on the pace of possible interest rate hikes by the U.S. central bank.

The government said on Tuesday it would invest about A$20 million ($15 million) into Pilbara Minerals Ltd's Pilgangoora project in Western Australia, which will produce lithium concentrate, a key component in electric vehicles and batteries. Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said it represented the conservative government's first investment in a mining project of its kind and demonstrated a commitment to clean energy technologies.  Lithium is a vital component used in battery storage, which helps to support Australia's increasing use of renewable energy,  the minister said in a statement. The move comes as the government looks to prove it is being  technology neutral  in its efforts to beef up power supply, amid a battle over whether that should include subsidies for coal-fired power. The investment is from the government's Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which took part in Pilbara Minerals' recently completed A$132 million bond issue. The proceeds of the bond issue together with A$80 million raised in a share sale will underpin the A$234 million required for the project's first stage of development. Construction is expected to start in early 2018, Pilbara Minerals said.

The Japanese aluminium premium PREM-ALUM-JP was set at $118 to $119 per tonne for metal to be shipped in the third quarter, down 7 percent to 8 percent from $128 per tonne in the previous quarter, the sources said. Japan is Asia's biggest importer of aluminium and the premium over the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price that its buyers agree to pay each quarter for primary metal shipments sets the benchmark for the region. The latest agreement follows two quarters of rising premiums, up 35 percent in Q2 and 27 percent in Q1.  We have settled the deals at $118 and $119 a tonne with all of the producers whom we buy the metal from,  a source at an end-user said. He declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks. A source at another fabricator said all the deals were signed at $118 a tonne while another source at an end-user said his company has agreed with all of the suppliers to pay $119 a tonne. A source at a producer confirmed all the deals had been settled by early last week. The quarterly pricing negotiations began last month between Japanese buyers and global producers, including Rio Tinto , South32, Alcoa Corp and Rusal , with initial offers at $123-128 a tonne. Buyers countered at around $110 to $115 a tonne due to lower spot premiums in Asia and the United States, but some signed at $119 early this month.  If the $119 deals were not so quickly signed early this month, we could have sought much lower levels,  one source said, pointing to recent spot deals hovering at around $100 to $105 a tonne in Japan and even lower in elsewhere in Asia.

Five was just right. Herrmann hit the sixth pitch he saw for a homer in the last of the first inning. Daniel Descalso chipped in with three RBIs when the Diamondbacks extended the best start in franchise history with a 6-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies at Chase Field on Monday.  To hit a home run my first leadoff appearance, that's pretty sweet,  said reserve Herrmann, who has played left field and catcher this season.  I know you are supposed to see a lot of pitches, so I did that part. I got a good pitch to hit. It was pretty cool. Probably one of my favorite home runs I've ever hit, because I'm not a leadoff hitter.  Herrmann's homer was his career-high seventh, and it gave the Diamondbacks (49-28) an early lift on on their 15 victory in 18 games. Arizona is three games ahead of the previous franchise record pace set by the Randy Johnson/Luis Gonzalez 2001 team. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at DiamondbacksPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchWith leadoff hitter A.J. Pollock on the disabled list and new leadoff hitter Gregor Blanco given a day off, Herrmann was the seventh player manager Torey Lovullo has used at the top spot.  I felt on the very low side he was going to have quality at-bats and drive up pitch counts,  Lovullo said.  The high side of it was, he drove the pitch out of the ballpark. That didn't surprise me at all. I thought he was going to be engaged.  Descalso had an RBI single in a two-run second inning and a two-run single in a three-run third as the Diamondbacks gave right-hander Zack Greinke a 6-1 lead. Greinke (9-4) gave up one run and three hits in five innings but left after throwing 102 pitches.  I was missing by a little bit and they weren't swinging at it,  Greinke said.  I wasn't trying to miss by a little bit, but it was just happening. Sometimes they swing at that pitch, but today they weren't, having a more patient eye and I had a deeper pitch count because of it.  Left fielder Daniel Nava had two hits and drove in a run for the Phillies (24-51), who have lost three in a row and 16 of 19. The Phillies are a major league-worst 10-31 on the road. After winning the series opener 6-1 on Friday, the Phillies scored three runs in the final three games of the wraparound series.  You know the old saying, pitching and defense wins games,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  But if you can't hit, you can't win a lot of games. It's hard to deal with. If it's not one thing, it's another.  After Herrmann gave the Diamondbacks a 1-0 lead with his seventh homer, Chris Owings opened the second inning with a double off Phillies starter Nick Pivetta (1-4) and Descalso singled to make it 2-0. Pivetta walked the next three, the walk to Herrmann forcing in another run. David Peralta and Jake Lamb singled and Owings walked to open third inning before Descalso's two-run single made it 5-0. Rey Fuentes singled in the final run of the inning. Greinke gave up singles to two of the first three batters he faced before retiring 12 in a row until the Phillies scored in the fifth inning. Brock Stassi and reliever Adam Morgan walked before Nava's two-out single drove in Stassi. Freddy Galvis walked to load the bases but Greinke got Aaron Altherr to ground out to third base on a 3-2 slider to end the inning. Pivetta gave up six runs on seven hits and five walks before leaving with two outs and the bases loaded in the third inning.  I didn't really have much of a release point,  Pivetta said.  I beat myself up. Let the team down.  NOTES: Arizona 1B Paul Goldschmidt did not play for the first time this season, the third game he has not started. Goldschmidt is the NL RBI leader with 65. ...

Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday. A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other's consent. Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011. Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the negotiations, also said that Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. Such a deal would allow Sprint to invest more in its network, the newspaper added.

Investors have long expected a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless service providers, anticipating cost cuts and other synergies in the range of $6 billion to $10 billion.

Rowling's magical creation. Since  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone  came out in 1997, with a first print run of just 500 copies, the series of seven novels has sold 450 million copies worldwide in 79 languages and spawned a blockbuster movie franchise. The book appeared in the United States a year later as  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone . On Monday, some fans took the day off work to celebrate the anniversary, heading to significant locations such as King's Cross train station in London, which in the stories is one of the gateways into the world of witches and wizards. The real-life station features a mock-up of Platform 9-3/4, the departure point for trains to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The mock-up is a bustling spot where tourists and fans queue to pose for photos wearing Potter-themed scarves or costumes.  Harry Potter I think still means so much to so many people even though it's 20 years now,  said Clara Carson, whose job at the nearby souvenir shop involves taking photos of the fans and holding up the scarves to achieve a windswept effect.  I'm a fan myself so it's really nice to come in and be with people that are all into the same things that you're into,  she said.  Whether they're kids or my age or even adults, they're always just so excited.  Childhood friends Charlotte Keyworth and Joanne Wylie, both 26, had come down to London from northern and eastern England for the occasion.

Her sentiments were widely echoed on social media, with legions of fans posting their favorite quotes or video clips, or just thanking Rowling for the happy memories.  After all these years...

Federer, 35, prevailed in their five-set battle in Australia to win a record-extending 18th slam, but sat out the claycourt season in which Nadal, 31, made his own history by winning a 10th French Open title -- 'La Decima' -- and 15th slam. In 2008, Nadal was just 22. He survived two rain breaks and an enthralling Federer fightback to end the Swiss's five-year reign as Wimbledon champion to finally triumph 6-4 6-4 6-7(5) 6-7(8) 9-7 after defeats in the 2006 and 2007 finals. The match, at four hours and 48 minutes, is still the longest final in Wimbledon history. It was hailed by pundits, players and fans alike, with seven-time grand slam champion John McEnroe describing it as the greatest match he'd ever seen. The Wimbledon seedings, to be confirmed on Wednesday, and Friday's draw will determine whether the titans could meet on Centre Court in the final of the tournament, which runs from July 3 to 16, for the first time since that tussle.  But for those who believe in omens, Nadal, then all pirate swagger with his long shorts, long hair and sleeveless shirts, won the 2008 Wimbledon title after annexing the French Open without dropping a set -- a feat he repeated earlier in June.   He'll go to Wimbledon with so much confidence. For me, he's favorite with Federer but Federer won't have the confidence of coming in as French Open champion,  Mats Wilander, three-times French Open champion and Eurosport host, told Reuters.

Very Motivated  He missed Wimbledon last year with a wrist injury and since he lost to Novak Djokovic in the 2011 final, Nadal has had an underwhelming run, with each of his four subsequent visits  ending in defeat to a player ranked 100 or lower. FILE PHOTO: Rafael Nadal of Spain celebrates defeating Roger Federer of Switzerland in their finals match at the Wimbledon tennis championships in London, Britain, July 6, 2008.Toby Melville/File PhotoYet Nadal gave notice of his intent after winning in Paris.  I'm motivated. Grass is not my specialty, but I'm very motivated,  he told reporters.  For his part, Federer, whose 2016 season came to an abrupt end after he lost in the Wimbledon semi-finals to runner-up Milos Raonic, made a sensational start to the year.  He prevailed in the 35th chapter of his rivalry with Nadal in January to clinch the Australian Open -- his first grand slam title since Wimbledon in 2012 -- before again trumping the Spaniard en route to claiming the Indian Wells and Miami titles. That run defied logic as Federer had spent the last six months of 2016 on the sidelines recuperating from a knee injury that had required surgery earlier in the season.  He then gave the unforgiving Roland Garros courts a miss to focus on Wimbledon and the hardcourt swing. While the grasscourt comeback for the seven-times Wimbledon champion faltered in the first round at Stuttgart, losing to German veteran Tommy Haas, Federer was imperious on Sunday as he won a ninth Halle title without dropping a set all week.  I was doubting myself a little bit, I must admit, because losing (in the opening) round for the first time in 15 years on grass was always going to shake me a little bit and it did,  Federer told the ATP men's tour website.  So I'm happy to react right away and let that be forgotten and actually move on and remind myself I actually can play well on grass.  And if Federer also needs a talisman from the statistics books as he heads to London, how about the fact that in the years that he won his first four finals -- 2004, 2005 and 2012 -- he also went on to win Wimbledon? Could the great man now do the same in 2017?    Editing by Ian Chadband","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-giants-idUSKBN19I07P"},

Yet since Federer clinched the first of his seven Wimbledon crowns, nobody outside of tennis's so-called big four has had a look-in at the All England Club with the Swiss, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray sweeping all before them. A quick glance at the bookmakers' favorites for this year's title shows few expect tennis's kings of the court to be dethroned any time soon.  Yet with the world's current top five all now in their thirties, perhaps this is the year for a new generation to announce their arrival. Below we take a look at some of the up-and-comers who could cause an upset.  Dominic Thiem (Austria) Age 23, ranked 8With his single-handed backhand, Austria's Dominic Thiem boasts one of the best shots in men's tennis, and another impressive claycourt season saw him emerge as the only person to beat Nadal on his beloved red dust this year.  En route to the French Open semi-finals for a second straight year, Thiem destroyed Djokovic, winning the third set 6-0 in 20 minutes, to further underline his growing stature in the game.  Questions remain, however, as to whether the claycourt specialist, who often stands deep behind the baseline to receive serve, can adapt to the slick lawns at SW19, where he has never gone past the second round.  Alexander Zverev (Germany) Age 20, ranked 12  Zverev's swashbuckling game has already seen him tipped as a future grand slam champion and he comes into Wimbledon with some pedigree, having won three tour titles this year.  The younger brother of world number 30 Mischa, Zverev showed his grasscourt prowess by reaching the final at Halle only to lose in straight sets to Federer, who he beat at the same event last year.  His season, however, has not been an unmitigated success: Days after beating Djokovic to win the Rome Masters, he crashed out of the French Open in the first round to Fernando Verdasco. Lucas Pouille (France) Age 23, ranked 15 Pouille made his mark when he ousted Nadal from last year's U.S. Open in a pulsating four-hour, fourth-round upset. That led the now 15-times grand slam champion to remark that Pouille  could fight for the big things the next couple of years . FILE PHOTO: Tennis - Monte Carlo Masters - Monaco, April 19, 2017. Alexander Zverev of Germany plays a shot to Feliciano Lopez of Spain.Eric Gaillard/File PhotoThe Frenchman's grasscourt pedigree looks good after he reached the quarter-finals at the All England Club last year, and he underlined his progress by claiming his second tour title of the season at the Wimbledon warmup event in Stuttgart.  Nick Kyrgios (Australia)  Age 22, ranked 20 Nick Kyrgios's three appearances at Wimbledon could be viewed as his fledgling career in microcosm. It is three years since he gave an early glimpse of the irresistible power at his disposal to blow then world number one Nadal off Centre Court in one of the most extraordinary upsets in the tournament's modern history.  Since then, however, his progress seems to have stuttered amid criticism of his attitude, behavior and commitment.  He faced accusations of tanking at Wimbledon in 2015 in a fourth round loss to Richard Gasquet, while his defeat to Andy Murray 12 months ago prompted John McEnroe to criticize his temperament. Borna Coric (Croatia) Age 20, ranked 42 Having reached a career-high 33 in the world in 2015 Coric is one of several young players who have been tipped for great things but have found the next step tricky. He slumped to 79 in the rankings earlier this year, but then claimed his first ATP title in Marrakesh in April.  Hyeon Chung (South Korea) Age 21, ranked 54 Hyeon Chung has little pedigree on grass, but he is among the brightest young talents in the game and showed a glimpse of his potential when he took Kei Nishikori to five sets in the third round of the French Open, his best grand slam performance.  Denis Shapovalov (Canada) Age 18, ranked 164 Wimbledon junior champion Denis Shapovalov sneaked into this year's main draw with a wildcard, but is undoubtedly a promising talent. He beat Britain's Kyle Edmund to reach the second round at Queen's before pushing former Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych to the limit in an enthralling three-set defeat.  The Canadian made headlines earlier this year when he was disqualified for striking umpire Arnaud Gabas in the eye with a ball after hitting it aimlessly towards the crowd during a Davis Cup tie against Britain.

But for all the naysayers who say that changes to the grass itself has made it too easy for the baseliners, players at Wimbledon next month would do well to remember that attack still dominates and even serve and volley has its merits. Tennis strategy analyst Craig O'Shannessy said 81 percent of all points in the men's singles at last year's Wimbledon (and 77 percent in the women's singles), were finished in the first five shots. The Australian, an experienced coach who helped to mastermind Dustin Brown's victory over Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2015, also looked at how players who win their matches perform in three categories; when the point was won in 1-4 shots, 5-8 shots or 9+.  In 2016 at Wimbledon, for 0-4, the winning player won them 94 percent of the time,  he told Reuters. For 5-8 it was 71 percent and in the 9+ category it was 64 percent.  If you look at all four slams in 2016; for 0-4 it was 91 percent, for 5-8 it was 66 percent and for 9+, it was 55 percent. So the match winner, in the 9+ category is only just over 50-50.  Leading players admit that out and out attack is not necessarily the best strategy.  You could just bludgeon back in the day and get high volleys,  Bob Bryan, who together with his twin brother Mike Bryan has won 16 grand slam titles including three Wimbledons, told Reuters.  Now you have to be more like a perfect pitcher. You've got to come and stick your volleys to the corners, or you're going to get passed. That's the bottom line.  But they will also tell you that attacking, aggressive tennis is still the best option.  I think attack is well rewarded on grass,  Milos Raonic, the runner-up to Andy Murray at Wimbledon last year.  Maybe it's a little bit less than before (but) I don't think it's necessarily because of the grass.  I think it's more because of the athleticism of the players and preparation of the players and ability. Also with technology for the players to defend better. But there are very few guys that will say they are happy playing mostly defense on grass.  Sam Querrey, the American who upset Novak Djokovic as the defending champion at Wimbledon last year, agrees.  You don't see guys serving and volleying as much, but you're still rewarded with a big serve and aggressive play,  he said. In response to criticism that the big-servers were making their showpiece into a boring ace contest, Wimbledon changed the grass it uses in late 2000 from 70 percent Rye and 30 percent creeping red fescue to 100 percent Rye. The effect was obvious. In the 2002 men's final between Lleyton Hewitt and David Nalbandian, there was not a single serve-and-volley point, a far cry from the days of John McEnroe, Boris Becker and Pete Sampras. The likes of Murray and Djokovic have made an art out of defending, their incredible movement and athleticism making it seem almost impossible to punch a hole through them. Serve and volley is seen as a dying art, but O'Shannessy said the statistics show that it remains as effective as ever.  There is absolutely no truth to the rumor or myth that serving and volleying doesn't work anymore,  he told Reuters.  The win percentage remains the same whether you do it a lot or a little.  In 2002, an average of 33 percent of players in the men's singles served and volleyed, compared with just 8 percent in 2016. But in both years, players serving and volleying won the point 67 percent of the time.  It just fell off the cliff, everybody stopped believing in it,  O'Shannessy said.  The average stays almost identical whether you do it a little or you do it a lot. If you stay at the baseline (comparing 2002 with 2016) the win percentage stayed the same at 46 percent. Are players simply being more selective in their use of it?  In 2002, one out of three (33 percent) for an entire tournament is not being selective, it's a full-on charge, and you're still at 67 percent. In 2016, where you are being selective, it's identical at 67 percent. The selective guy and the all-out guy are winning the same percentage.  So why do players buy into the perception that longer rallies mean more success?  Our minds trick us,  O'Shannessy said.  We naturally remember the more spectacular, more fascinating, long rallies. You remember drama and there's very little drama in short rallies.  Secondly, we have literally never had this data. We just haven't known how front-end-loaded winning is in a match.  When we go to the practice court, we spend most of our time on the back end of the point, ball after ball after ball. We just got it wrong.  The practice court is completely broken and doesn't mirror where winning happens in a match.

The move follows similar actions by its three main rivals - ANZ Banking Group, National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp - as regulators fret over financial stability risks amid rising housing prices and record-high household debt. It was the second out-of-cycle increase - not in lock-step with central bank action - by the  Big Four  in just three months. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has held rates steady at a record low 1.50 percent after last easing in August 2016. The change, effective July 7, will bring CBA's investor interest-only rate to 6.24 percent and owner-occupied interest-only rate to 5.77 percent. At the same time, the bank said it will lower variable interest rates by 3 basis points on principal and interest home loans to 5.22 percent for owner occupiers.  These changes help us keep the right balance in our home loan portfolio, in line with what our regulators require,  said Matt Comyn, group executive of retail banking services. Regulators have intensified pressure on the quartet to slow down lending, in particular interest-only loans which are massively favoured by speculative investors and have been a key driver of rapid home price gains in recent years. Policy makers are worried excessive debt in the property market will hurt spending elsewhere in the economy and lead to financial stability risks as the household debt-to-income ratio has climbed to an all-time peak of 189 percent.

After the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score, Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, said she could not support moving forward on the bill as written. Collins' opposition highlights the delicate balance that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must strike as he tries to deliver a legislative win to President Donald Trump by reconciling the Republican Party's moderate and conservative wings. Moderate senators are concerned about millions of people losing insurance. Key conservative senators have said the Senate bill does not do enough to repeal Obamacare. The CBO assessment that an additional 15 million people would be uninsured in 2018 under the bill and its prediction that insurance premiums would skyrocket over the first two years prompted concern from both sides.  McConnell's goal was to have a vote on the bill before the July 4 recess that starts at the end of this week. But several Republicans, including Collins, have said they would not approve a procedural motion that would clear the way for a vote. McConnell can afford to lose just two Republican senators from their 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate, which would allow passage of the bill with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote.    If you are on the fence ... this CBO score didn't help you, so I think it's going to be harder to get to 50, not easier,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said of the bill's prospects. The CBO score is also likely to amplify criticism from industry groups such as the American Medical Association, which said earlier on Monday that the Senate's bill violated the doctors' precept of  first, do no harm.  The CBO is only able to assess the impact of legislation within a 10-year window, but it said that insurance losses are expected to grow beyond 22 million due to deep cuts to the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled that are not scheduled to go into effect until 2025.  Trump and Republicans in Congress made repealing and replacing Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic legislation, a central campaign promise. The pressure is on for them to deliver now that they control the White House, House of Representatives and Senate. Republicans view Obamacare as costly government intrusion and say that individual insurance markets are collapsing. Obamacare expanded health coverage to some 20 million Americans by expanding Medicaid and mandating that individuals obtain health insurance. The CBO score was released just hours after Republicans revised the bill, adding a measure that would penalize people who let their insurance coverage lapse for an extended period. The move followed criticism that the original bill would result in a sicker - and more expensive - insurance pool.  White House Role At least four conservative Republicans - Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee - have expressed opposition to the Senate legislation.    Moderate Republicans have warned against replacing Obamacare with legislation that is too similar to the version passed by the House, saying it would cause too many people, especially those with low incomes, to lose health coverage. The CBO estimated that the House bill would cause 23 million people to lose insurance. Trump had called the House bill  mean  and asked Senate Republicans to come up with  more generous  legislation. Democrats uniformly oppose both the House and Senate versions of the bill.  CBO's report today makes clear that this bill is every bit as 'mean as the House bill,  Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters. FILE PHOTO: An electronic patients chart is shown on the wall to a hospital room at the newly constructed Kaiser Permanente San Diego Medical Center hospital in San Diego, California April 17, 2017.Mike BlakeThe White House in a statement on Monday criticized the CBO for issuing a  flawed report  and said its assessments should not be  trusted blindly.  Trump and McConnell have been working to shore up support. The president called key conservative senators over the weekend, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.  Both Cruz and Johnson said they were concerned about CBO estimates that insurance premiums would initially rise as much as 30 percent over the first two years before declining.  Doesn't help the people whose premiums skyrocket next year,  Cruz told reporters.  Kind of a problem, isn't it?  Johnson said of the short-term premium increase. Johnson and Paul have said they will oppose the procedural motion that would allow the Senate to move forward to a vote. Cruz is drafting suggested fixes. Paul remains opposed to the bill.     The first moderate Republican to oppose the bill, Senator Dean Heller, is already facing political fallout. America First Policies, a political group run by former Trump campaign staffers, said it would air healthcare-related attack ads against Heller, who faces a competitive re-election race in Nevada next year. Senator Rob Portman, of Ohio, who has not said whether he supports the bill, was  dressed down  by McConnell during a Monday leadership meeting, a senior Republican aide told Reuters.  Ohio participates in Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, and Republican Governor John Kasich has criticized the Senate bill. Portman's office did not respond to a request to comment. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said his governor, fellow Republican Rick Scott, would be on Capitol Hill this week to discuss the bill's impact on the state. Constituent and industry groups have been critical of the Senate bill's proposal to reduce the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and point to the CBO analysis that it would disproportionately affect older adults. Legislative Tweak Under Senate rules, the bill must replicate savings projected in the House version that passed last month. It cleared that critical hurdle, with the CBO estimating it would decrease the budget deficit by $321 billion over 2017-2026. A revision to the bill that imposes a penalty for prolonged lapses in insurance coverage addresses the original bill's provision to drop the Obamacare penalty on those who do not have insurance. Experts had warned that canceling the fine could lead to a sicker insurance pool because young and healthy people would not face consequences for failing to purchase insurance.  The bill would impose a six-month waiting period for anyone who lets their health insurance lapse for over 63 days and then wants to re-enroll in a plan in the individual market. The 15 million people the CBO estimates would be uninsured in 2018 is largely due to the repeal of the penalty associated with being uninsured. The CBO did not evaluate the revised version that included the new waiting period. Insurer Blue Cross and Blue Shield said it was encouraged by the inclusion of incentives for continuous coverage. Molina Healthcare said it preferred the Obamacare mandate, said that and the Senate bill, even after revised, would simply delay care. If the Senate passes a bill, it will either have to be approved by the House, the two chambers would have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee, or the House could pass a new version and bounce it back to the Senate.

While German women have had two more finalists with Sabine Lisicki and Angelique Kerber at the All England club since Graf's last win there in 1996, the men have had none. Of the seven editions of Wimbledon between 1985 to 1991 Germans Boris Becker and Michael Stich won four between them. Apart from his three Wimbledon crowns Becker also won two Australian Open titles and one U.S. Open in his career, with no German able to emulate him or Stich since then.  With an output of altogether four Wimbledon men's singles titles between 1985 and 1991, Michael Stich and Boris Becker certainly defined an era in German tennis history,  German Tennis Federation President Sepp Klaus told Reuters.  Both were exceptional athletes and their names are still closely associated with our sport.  Klaus was quick to point out players like Rainer Schuettler and Tommy Haas had since reached the last four in London while Philipp Petzschner won the doubles competition in 2010. Despite Philipp Kohlschreiber and Nicolas Kiefer reaching the last eight, Germany have clearly missed the chance to build on their successful tennis run as other nations did before them. Sweden churned out a string of top professionals following Bjorn Borg's successful era, with Stefan Edberg, Mats Wilander and Thomas Johansson winning men's singles slams. New Concept Becker-mania and the German public's enthusiasm gradually ebbed as success became rarer in the 2000s with Becker's biggest headlines late in his career concerning off-court issues. Sponsors also moved away from the sport in Germany leaving the country without a Tier 1 event after the German Open in 2008 was downgraded from its Masters series status. Even worse, the Berlin women's tournament, one of the oldest women's competitions in the world, was abolished nine years ago despite being a top tier event. Klaus said the DTB's new concept for promoting young talent launched in April would deliver the country's next top players more efficiently. The idea is to identify talented youngsters earlier and draw them into the federation aged 12-14 while also linking top talent with national team coaches to facilitate the move from youth player to professional.   With hugely impressive 20-year-old Alexander Zverev, the world number 12 who has stormed to three titles already this year, turning the spotlight more on tennis in Germany, the timing could not have been better.  The new concept of the DTB will provide a structure in which young players will hopefully thrive,  Klaus said.  It is our aim to find and support these talents at an earlier stage and to help them even more with the transition to professional tennis.   I am convinced that our efforts will pay off and strengthen German tennis, and especially German men’s tennis, in the long run.

The move would cause a huge problem for the cash-strapped state, which has accumulated a $15 billion bill backlog due to a budget stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. It could force Illinois to stop making full payments on other state-mandated or court-ordered spending such as pensions and payroll. The filing in U.S. District Court by attorneys representing Medicaid recipients asked Judge Joan Lefkow to order the state to pay $500 million a month for four months to start reducing a $3.1 billion pile of unpaid bills owed to managed care organizations that turn pay doctors and others. As long as Illinois remains without an enacted budget, the proposed order calls for the state to spend an additional $586 million a month to cover Medicaid-related bills incurred after June 30, 2017. The proposed order noted that federal reimbursements for Medicaid would reduce Illinois' outlay to $543 million a month. The two sides are scheduled to appear on Wednesday before Lefkow, who previously ruled Illinois' minimal payments to managed care organizations did not comply with federal consent decrees that resulted from two cases filed against the state in 1992. The judge had ordered negotiations aimed at getting Illinois to  substantial  compliance with the decrees, noting the state has managed to make its monthly bond and pension payments on time and in full. Monthly payments related to the Medicaid and other consent decrees have totaled only about $160 million. In the wake of Lefkow's order, Illinois general obligation bond prices plummeted and yields soared in U.S. municipal market trading, although the bonds subsequently clawed back some losses. The state comptroller last week pledged to not delay or diminish debt service payments. There was no immediate reaction to the court filing from the Illinois Attorney General's office. Rauner ordered lawmakers back into a special session, which began June 21 and is scheduled to end on Friday, to pass a budget before fiscal 2018 begins on Saturday. Entering a third-straight fiscal year without a spending plan could sink Illinois' credit ratings to  junk,  a first for any U.S. state.

At a closely watched first meeting between the two, Trump and Modi appeared to get along well. Modi pulled in Trump for a bear hug on the stage as the cameras rolled in the Rose Garden. “I deeply appreciate your strong commitment to the enhancement of our bilateral relations,  Modi told him.  I am sure that under your leadership a mutually beneficial strategic partnership will gain new strength, new positivity, and will reach new heights.” Trump was also warm but made clear he sees a need for more balance in the U.S.-India trade relationship in keeping with his campaign promise to expand American exports and create more jobs at home. Last year the U.S. trade deficit with India neared $31 billion. Trump said he would like a trading relationship that is  fair and reciprocal.    It is important that barriers be removed to the export of U.S. goods into your markets and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country,  he said. Trump said he was pleased about an Indian airline’s recent order of 100 new American planes and that the United States looked forward to exporting more energy, including major long-term contracts to purchase American natural gas. These energy contracts  are being negotiated and we will sign – trying to get the price up a little bit,  Trump said. Modi came to Washington looking to revitalize a relationship that thrived under former President Barack Obama but has appeared to flag as Trump courted India's rival China in an effort to persuade Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea. Modi effusively praised Trump, hailing his “vast and successful experience in the business world” and “great leadership” for U.S.-India ties, which he said should “lend an aggressive and forward looking agenda to our relations.” Related CoverageTrump, Modi call North Korea's 'grave threat' to peace: White HouseTrump, India's Modi call on Pakistan to stem terrorist attacksTrump accepted Modi's invitation to visit India, the White House said in a statement, but no time frame was given for the trip. Modi harked back to Trump's  Make America Great Again  campaign slogan to stress that his agenda for his country was little different than Trump's.  I am sure that the convergence of my vision for  New India  and President Trump’s vision for making America great again will add new dimensions to our cooperation,  he said. Trump did not mention U.S. differences with India on immigration and the Paris climate accord.  The future of our partnership has never looked brighter,  Trump said as both leaders underscored the importance of the defense and security relationship. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugs U.S. President Donald Trump as he departures the White House after a visit, in Washington, U.S., June 26, 2017.Carlos BarriaAviation Deals As they met, a Pentagon agency said the U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to India of a Boeing C-17 transport aircraft with an estimated cost of $366 million. The United States also has offered to sell a naval variant of the Predator drone made by U.S. defense contractor General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, the White House said in a statement, a deal that would be worth more than $2 billion. The United States has become the leading supplier of defense equipment to India, signing contracts worth more than $15 billion since 2008. On Monday evening, Trump and Modi had a working dinner, the first time Trump has played host to a foreign dignitary at a White House dinner. Slideshow (15 Images)Trump administration officials have pointed to both leaders' impact on social media - each has more than 30 million Twitter followers - as proof they are cut from the same cloth.  If the chemistry is good, everything else gets sorted,  said an Indian official.  The only way is up. How much up we go depends on the leaders. If they click, we go up higher.  Trade, however, remains an irritant, and on Saturday, leading U.S. congressmen complained in a letter to Trump that high-level engagement had failed to eliminate major barriers to U.S. imports and investment and had not deterred India from imposing new ones. Indian officials reject suggestions that Modi's  Make in India  platform is protectionist and complain about the U.S. regulatory process for generic pharmaceuticals and rules on fruit imports. They stress the future importance of the huge Indian market to U.S. firms and major growth in areas such as aviation which will offer significant opportunities for U.S. manufacturers. Among the Indian business executives in Washington for Modi's visit was Ajay Singh, chairman of Indian budget airline SpiceJet, which in January announced a deal to buy up to 205 aircraft from Boeing, worth up to $22 billion at list prices. Singh told Reuters that according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the deal would sustain up to 132,000 jobs.  The market is growing 20-25 percent a year. Even at today’s pace you need 100 more planes a year just to keep pace with the market and we are not getting anywhere close to that number.  “As our economy grows ... we can potentially create a lot of jobs for Americans in the United States,” he said. Boeing has estimated India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel.

The recommendations from the Australian Energy Market Commission are the latest in a series of measures taken by the government and regulators to shore up power supply in the wake of a string of blackouts, warnings of gas shortfalls and soaring energy prices. The commission's chairman, John Pierce, said the technical proposals would address risks to energy security created by the power system's shift toward renewable energy, which has introduced more complexity in running the grid when the wind and sun die down.  Our reform package is looking at ways to stabilize the system as the generation mix changes, and new technology generators connect,  Pierce said in a statement. The commission called for the market to use new technology like batteries to back up the system when there is a sudden supply outage, among a range of technical measures to shore up grid security. Networks could contract with suppliers of services like fast frequency response from emerging technologies like batteries, to help maintain minimum security levels, it said. The commission also called for new connecting generators to pay for remedial action if they harmed the strength of the system. Looking to prevent further outages and cap rising energy  prices the federal government and states have announced plans to restart mothballed gas-fired power plants, fund energy storage and introduce gas export controls. However the latest outlook from the Australian Energy Market Operator released earlier this month warned that despite those efforts to beef up supply, eastern Australia's power grid will be stretched again if fierce heatwaves hit over the next two summers. It comes on the heels of a call from Australia's chief scientist for the federal government to set a  fuel neutral  clean energy target that provides an incentive to build new generation to cap soaring power prices, cut carbon emissions and keep the lights on.

Haiti has pinned some of its economic growth hopes on the textile industry, which accounts for 90 percent of its exports, according to export.gov, a website managed by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The United States has granted Haiti a preferential trade deal, creating some 40,000 jobs, the Association of Haitian Industries said last November. Products made there are shipped to major U.S. retailers like Walmart and Target. However, spurred by a recent hike in fuel prices and surging inflation, textile workers have begun protesting over pay. On Monday, they marched across town from an industrial park near the airport to the Ministry of Social Affairs in downtown Port-au-Prince, singing and waving signs with slogans like  Long live the independent fight for factory workers.  Workers in textile factories currently earn 300 Haitian gourdes ($4.77). They are demanding a raise to 800 gourdes a day. An annual report seen by Reuters from the High Council of Salaries, which is tasked with recommending changes to the minimum wage, had proposed an increase to 400 gourdes a day. But it was never released due to a dispute within the council. Last week, six companies wrote to the office of Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant, demanding the government stop the protests, in letters that became public on Monday.  Total cost competitiveness, quality production and the proximity (to) the U.S. were the reasons we selected Haiti while betting on major improvements on salary predictability and political stability,  the companies wrote in identical letters.  If those benefits no longer (exist), we will have to make other strategic (arrangements to) move from Haiti to other places where there is a clear state strategy to boost investments and protect investors while creating and protecting decent jobs,  they added. The six companies that signed the letters were MGA Haiti S.A., Astro Carton d'Haiti S.A., Haiti Cheung Won S.A., Textile Youm Kwang S.A., Pacific Sports Haiti S.A. and Wilbes Haitian S.A. Earlier this month, Roosevelt Bellevue, minister of social affairs and labor, expressed a similar view.  If the salary becomes too high, companies will leave and go to the Dominican Republic or Nicaragua,  he told reporters. Representatives from MGA Haiti and Astro Carton d'Haiti confirmed they had sent the letters, and said they had lost between $50,000 and $60,000 due to the protests. The other four textile companies could not be reached immediately for comment.

Rodrigo Janot submitted the charge in a document presented to the Supreme Court, saying  he fooled Brazilian citizens  and owed the nation millions in compensation for accepting bribes. Under Brazilian law, the lower house of Congress must now vote on whether to allow the top tribunal to try the conservative leader, who replaced impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff just over a year ago. Lawmakers within Temer's coalition are confident they have the votes to block the two-third majority required to proceed with a trial. But they warn that support may wane if congressmen are forced to vote several times to protect Temer - whose popularity is languishing in the single-digits - from trial. Temer's office and his attorney, Antonio Mariz, declined to comment on the charges. Temer has repeatedly said he is innocent of any wrongdoing. Investigators have uncovered stunning levels of corruption in recent years engulfing Brazil's political class and business elites. Much of it centers on companies paying billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives at state-run enterprises in return for lucrative contracts.  Temer and one-third of his cabinet, as well as four former presidents and dozens of lawmakers are under investigation or already charged in the schemes. Over 90 people have been convicted.  Political analysts had warned, long before Monday, that the scandals reduced the chances Temer could push through reforms crucial for Latin America's biggest economy to rebound from its worst recession on record. Temer was charged in connection with a graft scheme involving the world's largest meatpacker, JBS SA. Executives said in plea-bargain testimony the president took  bribes for resolving tax matters, freeing up loans from state-run banks and other matters. Monday's charging document alleges Temer arranged to eventually receive a total of 38 million reais ($11.5 million) from JBS in the next nine months.  Joesley Batista, one of the brothers who control JBS, recorded a conversation with Temer in March in which the president appears to condone bribing a potential witness. Batista also accused Temer and aides of negotiating millions of dollars in illegal donations for his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. Brazil's federal police released a separate document on Monday about that conversation with Batista. Police recovered a previously inaudible portion of the recording in which Temer is heard telling the scandal-plagued billionaire that it was mainly because of his influence that he chose to appoint Henrique Meirelles as finance minister. Brazilian President Michel Temer attends a credentials presentation ceremony for several new top diplomats at Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil June 26, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoThe significance of the comment about Meirelles, who is widely respected in financial markets, was not immediately clear and the finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Legal Gridlock Key lawmakers in Temer's alliance told Reuters, on condition of anonymity, they would halt work on proposed labor reforms if forced to vote on charges against the president. Temer's supporters say they have between 250 and 300 votes in the 513 seat lower house to block a trial. But the president is expected to soon face charges of racketeering and obstruction of justice, each requiring a separate vote. Prosecutors have said they may also file other charges, which they have not yet given details on. On Monday, the federal police recommended charging Temer with obstruction of justice - the first step toward a likely round of other charges in addition to graft. Top lawmakers said Janot's expected strategy of presenting charges one at a time would throw Temer's future into uncertainty.  With all of congress facing re-election next year, many said that if public outrage boiled over, it would be hard to maintain support for Temer.

Rodrigo Janot submitted the charge in a document presented to the Supreme Court, saying  he fooled Brazilian citizens  and owed the nation millions in compensation for accepting bribes. Under Brazilian law, the lower house of Congress must now vote on whether to allow the top tribunal to try the conservative leader, who replaced impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff just over a year ago. Lawmakers within Temer's coalition are confident they have the votes to block the two-third majority required to proceed with a trial. But they warn that support may wane if congressmen are forced to vote several times to protect Temer - whose popularity is languishing in the single-digits - from trial. Temer's office and his attorney, Antonio Mariz, declined to comment on the charges. Temer has repeatedly said he is innocent of any wrongdoing. Investigators have uncovered stunning levels of corruption in recent years engulfing Brazil's political class and business elites. Much of it centers on companies paying billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives at state-run enterprises in return for lucrative contracts.  Temer and one-third of his cabinet, as well as four former presidents and dozens of lawmakers are under investigation or already charged in the schemes. Over 90 people have been convicted.  Political analysts had warned, long before Monday, that the scandals reduced the chances Temer could push through reforms crucial for Latin America's biggest economy to rebound from its worst recession on record. Temer was charged in connection with a graft scheme involving the world's largest meatpacker, JBS SA. Executives said in plea-bargain testimony the president took  bribes for resolving tax matters, freeing up loans from state-run banks and other matters. Monday's charging document alleges Temer arranged to eventually receive a total of 38 million reais ($11.5 million) from JBS in the next nine months.  Joesley Batista, one of the brothers who control JBS, recorded a conversation with Temer in March in which the president appears to condone bribing a potential witness. Batista also accused Temer and aides of negotiating millions of dollars in illegal donations for his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. Brazil's federal police released a separate document on Monday about that conversation with Batista. Police recovered a previously inaudible portion of the recording in which Temer is heard telling the scandal-plagued billionaire that it was mainly because of his influence that he chose to appoint Henrique Meirelles as finance minister. Brazilian President Michel Temer attends a credentials presentation ceremony for several new top diplomats at Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil June 26, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoThe significance of the comment about Meirelles, who is widely respected in financial markets, was not immediately clear and the finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Legal Gridlock Key lawmakers in Temer's alliance told Reuters, on condition of anonymity, they would halt work on proposed labor reforms if forced to vote on charges against the president. Temer's supporters say they have between 250 and 300 votes in the 513 seat lower house to block a trial. But the president is expected to soon face charges of racketeering and obstruction of justice, each requiring a separate vote. Prosecutors have said they may also file other charges, which they have not yet given details on. On Monday, the federal police recommended charging Temer with obstruction of justice - the first step toward a likely round of other charges in addition to graft. Top lawmakers said Janot's expected strategy of presenting charges one at a time would throw Temer's future into uncertainty.  With all of congress facing re-election next year, many said that if public outrage boiled over, it would be hard to maintain support for Temer.   If this grinds on with multiple votes, you may start to see a lack of governability,  said one top lawmaker in Temer's coalition.  In that case, there will be defections, and colleagues may start to move against Temer.

It was not until a board meeting on 21 June 2017 that the financial condition of each of its global divisions, including the Emerging Markets division, had been clarified and confirmed,  the company said in response to a query raised by the Australian Securities Exchange. QBE last week surprised the market with a profit warning, saying it would report lower than expected earnings due to underwriting losses in its emerging markets division. The late notice angered investors and caused a slump in its share price. The company downgraded its overall combined operating ratio to the 94.5 percent to 96 percent range, compared with a February guidance of 93.5 percent to 95 percent. A higher combined operating ratio translates to lower underwriting profits for insurers. The company forecast interim insurance profit margin to be in the range of 8.5 percent to 9.5 percent. It reported insurance profit margin of 9.7 percent in 2016. Shares of Australia's no.1 insurer fell as much as 1.5 percent to A$11.45 in early trade, their lowest level since early-December, before swinging back into the green.

When combined with preliminary anti-subsidy duties issued in April, the new measures will bring total duties on Canadian lumber to between 17.41 percent and 30.88 percent. The announcement, which was largely expected, prompted an angry reaction from the Canadian government against what it called  unfair and punitive duties.  We will vigorously defend Canada's softwood lumber industry, including through litigation,  the government said in a statement. The bilateral dispute is the fifth over lumber in less than 40 years.  U.S. producers asked the Commerce Department last November to investigate what they viewed as unfair subsidies to Canadian competitors, many of whom procure their timber from government lands at cheaper rates. U.S. lumber producers generally cut timber grown on private land. Canada, which denies it subsidizes producers, said earlier this month it would give C$867 million ($654 million) in aid to the domestic industry. Earlier on Monday, the Commerce Department said it made a preliminary decision to exclude Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island from its investigation into whether Canada is dumping or unfairly subsidizing softwood lumber. Until the decision is confirmed, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the duties would still be collected on lumber from the three provinces. The exclusion does not include New Brunswick, an Atlantic province bordering Maine that is also a major producer of softwood lumber.  The U.S. anti-subsidy and anti-dumping probes affect about $5.66 billion worth of imports of the construction material, and they show the United States taking a tough stance on trade with Canada as the two countries and Mexico prepare to renegotiate the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. Much of the wood in the excluded Canadian provinces is also harvested from private land, and the three provinces had argued they operate under more of a free-market model. Commerce said it is scheduled to announce a final decision on the anti-dumping duties on Sept. 7.

The court is considering part of the reform that prohibited America Movil from charging other telephone carriers for connecting their calls made to customers on its network, while letting those companies charge America Movil for connecting its calls to their customers. A favorable ruling for Slim might eliminate that rule and even force America Movil's rivals to reimburse it for calls made in recent years. That could boost America Movil's market capitalization by $21 billion, an increase of about 40 percent, according to a report by Banamex.   The Supreme Court has not said when it might rule on the case. However, last week it ruled on a minor, related case. Some industry watchers have speculated that a ruling on the larger case could come in the next few weeks. America Movil holds over two-thirds of Mexico's mobile subscriptions.

A favorable ruling for Slim might eliminate that rule and even force America Movil's rivals to reimburse it for calls made in recent years. That could boost America Movil's market capitalization by $21 billion, an increase of about 40 percent, according to a report by Banamex.   The Supreme Court has not said when it might rule on the case. However, last week it ruled on a minor, related case. Some industry watchers have speculated that a ruling on the larger case could come in the next few weeks. America Movil holds over two-thirds of Mexico's mobile subscriptions. A company spokesman declined to comment on the case in the Supreme Court.

Shares of the company, formerly a part of Alcoa, fell as much as 11.3 percent after Reuters reported on Saturday it had supplied the cladding knowing it would be used at Grenfell Tower, despite warning in its brochures those specific panels were a fire risk for tall buildings. Lawyers told Reuters that Arconic could face lawsuits on both sides of the Atlantic over its role in the fire, including claims brought by victims and their families, although the extent of the company's legal liabilities is not clear. Arconic did not immediately reply to a request for comment on potential legal action. Announcing the end of sales of the panels for tall buildings, Arconic cited  inconsistencies in building codes around the world  and code compliance issues that have arisen concerning use of cladding systems as a result of the Grenfell Tower fire. UK authorities said the use of the panels in Grenfell Tower was in breach of UK building regulations.  Arconic declined to comment on whether the material met UK building regulations, saying it was for local contractors and officials to decide whether or not its materials were suitable and consistent with local regulations. Other companies involved in the refurbishment of the building in which the Arconic cladding material was fitted said they complied with all local rules. Nonetheless, Arconic advised in one brochure seen by Reuters that combustible cladding materials were a fire risk in tall buildings and that above 30 meters (98 ft) non-combustible materials should be used. Its polyethylene (PE) panel material is combustible. Grenfell Tower is more than 60 meters high.   The issue is they supplied material that was used above their own marketing material's suggested limit,  said Seaport Global Securities analyst Josh Sullivan.  The concern is around the ultimate liability. You have one of the largest fires in UK history and they're searching for somebody to be at fault.  The stock clawed back some losses after Monday's announcement and closed down 6 percent at $24.01 as more than five times the usual number of shares changed hands. Arconic's junk bonds fell by up to 2.5 points.  Litigation Fears Arconic was created last year as Alcoa's specialty metals business, while the bauxite and aluminum businesses were split off under the Alcoa name. Last month Arconic emerged from a bruising battle with activist investor Elliott Management, during which its chief executive resigned. The Reuters report on Saturday cited six emails from 2014 between Deborah French, UK sales manager at Arconic - then called Alcoa - and executives at the contractors involved in the bidding process for Grenfell Tower's refurbishment contract.  These showed Arconic knew it was supplying for a building called  Grenfell Tower  but not whether the company knew the building's exact height. The company declined to say if it knew this. Lawyers told Reuters that plaintiffs could argue the company acted negligently by supplying material it knew was flammable.  Thomas Jervis, a London-based lawyer at the firm Leigh Day who represents plaintiffs, said his firm has already been contacted by potential clients affected by the fire. Lawyers said that since most of the companies involved in work at Grenfell Tower were small, plaintiffs are likely to pursue Arconic as the only deep-pocketed party.  Claimants could be attracted by the fact that damages settlements in the United States tend to be much bigger than those in the UK, where punitive damages are limited and most awards focus on actual losses and lost future income, which is based on victims' earnings capacity. But any claims could be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, said Duncan Fairgrieve, a senior research fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. “U.S. courts have become less keen to hear cases which have really occurred in and have strong links to other jurisdictions,” he said. While the extent of Arconic's responsibility was not immediately clear, investors were taking a  sell now and ask questions later  approach, according to Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York, New York.   The company has said it will continue to support UK authorities as they investigate the June 14 fire.

The government said the number of high-rise tower blocks in England found to have  cladding  - panels placed on the facades of buildings, mainly for insulation or to improve their appearance - that have failed fire safety tests had risen to 75 from 60.

Trump will deliver an address on his administration's new mantra of  energy dominance  at the Energy Department, officials told reporters. They declined to give details on how he would tweak existing regulations that have not stopped a surge in exports.  We’ve gone from the age of scarcity now to the age of abundance when it comes to American energy,  Mike Catanzaro, a White House energy policy aide, told reporters.  We want to use those abundant resources for good here at home and for good abroad as well,  Catanzaro said. Trump's speech comes a week before he meets in Warsaw with leaders of a dozen central and eastern European nations who are eager to see more U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) in their markets as an alternative to Russian gas. Trump is stopping at the summit on his way to the G20 in Hamburg, Germany, where he is expected to meet face-to-face for the first time in his presidency with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

President Donald Trump gives a thumbs up as he walks up the West Wing colonnade to greet India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Modi arrives for a visit in Washington.Kevin LamarqueThe Trump administration believes in an  all-of-the-above  approach to energy, Perry said - borrowing the energy catch-phrase of the Obama administration. U.S. domestic energy prices have plunged in recent years because of the natural gas boom, crowding out competing sources of power, including coal and nuclear. Dozens of nuclear power reactors are in danger of shutting down over the next several years as a result. The Trump administration wants to make sure the United States remains  technologically and economically engaged  in the nuclear industry, Perry said.  If we do not, then China and Russia will fill that void,  he said. But he said the administration would not be  wildly supportive  of subsidizing any sectors of the energy industry. Perry said energy supports in the tax code would be examined as the administration and Congress look at tax reform later this year.  I think we’ll have a good healthy conversation about the energy sector and tax incentives, subsidies - all of that needs to be on the table and we need to have a conversation about it,  Perry said.

In a flurry of activity at the court on Monday, Gorsuch showed his inclination to rule from a spot occupied by fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas. At a minimum, he is so far living up to Trump's claim that he would be a conservative in the mold of the man he replaced, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Thomas, appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1991, is seen by legal experts as the most conservative of the nine justices and is known for his idiosyncratic views of some legal issues. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority. Two of the conservative majority, Anthony Kennedy, and to a lesser extent Chief Justice John Roberts, sometimes side with the liberals. Liberal groups and Democratic senators had vociferously opposed Gorsuch's appointment, with the evidence so far suggesting their depiction of him as a dogged conservative was largely correct.  Justice Gorsuch has shown himself to be the conservative ideologue many predicted he would be and not the moderating check on the executive branch as others suggested he would be,  said Michele Jawando, a lawyer with the liberal Center for American Progress. Conservatives, meanwhile, are delighted. Their hope that Gorsuch, 49, would be a solid vote on the right, would appear to be well founded.  Gorsuch is rapidly becoming my favorite justice,  said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the libertarian Cato Institute. The new justice, formerly an appeals court judge in Colorado, was sworn in on April 10 after Democrats made a concerted effort to block his confirmation by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. Gorsuch has not been shy to make his voice heard since day one on the bench when, during three one-hour arguments, he sparred with attorneys no fewer than eight times.  I'm sorry for taking up so much time, I apologize,  he said, smiling, after one such lengthy exchange. FILE PHOTO: Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch stands his wife Louise during his investiture  ceremony at the Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., June 15, 2017.Joshua RobertsGorsuch has asserted himself on paper as well. His one opinion for the court, in a case about debt collection, was unanimous. But it's not unusual for new justices to be assigned a first opinion to write where the court is in broad agreement. In the cases where the court has been divided, he has reliably stuck with the conservative wing while showing something of an independent streak similar to Thomas. Gorusch nailed his colors to the mast in a series of written opinions and votes on Monday. In the biggest dispute before the justices, the court handed a partial win to Trump by partly reviving his travel ban that he has said is needed for security reasons but opponents criticize as discriminatory. The ban was blocked by lower courts and the high court agreed to hear oral arguments in its next term starting in October. Gorsuch, with two of the court's other conservatives, said they would have voted to allow the entire ban to go into effect. When the court also declined to hear what would have been a major gun rights case on whether the constitutional right to keep firearms for self-defense extends outside the home, only two of the nine justices dissented. One was Thomas. The other was Gorsuch. A gay rights case saw a similar pattern, with Thomas, Gorsuch and fellow conservative Samuel Alito the only dissenters as the court threw out an Arkansas court ruling that allowed the state to refuse to list both same-sex spouses on birth certificates. Gorsuch has also showed a willingness to quibble with his colleagues on what might seem minor points. In the court's big ruling on Monday in a religious rights case, the justices were split 7-2 on allowing a church to apply for state funding to re-pave its school playground. Gorsuch wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Thomas, in which he explained in part why he agreed with all of the majority opinion, except for one footnote that limited it.  It could be that he is more similar to Thomas than Scalia. If he continues this pattern it might be significant,  said Ilya Somin, a libertarian law professor at George Mason University.

This will lead to further brand polarisation and dampen the profitability of weaker brands. Chang'an Automobile lowered its retail prices across different models in late-May 2017, followed by JAC Motors' price promotions for its best-selling models in early June. Great Wall, the largest Chinese sport utility vehicle (SUV) manufacturer, cut the retail prices of various H2/H6 models in early June after launching a CNY1 billion  red packet  promotional campaign in March. Fitch expects price competition to intensify among proprietary brands in 2017, especially in the rich-margin SUV segment, as auto demand remains subdued. Some small, weak proprietary brands are likely to suffer market share losses and margin compression, while brands with competitive product offerings in the past twelve months, including Geely, Guangzhou Automobile Group's Trumpchi and SAIC Motor's Roewe, are likely to outperform in sales growth and retain healthy profitability. Proprietary automakers have slowed wholesale vehicle deliveries to dealers to ease the latter's inventory and financial burdens. Chinese proprietary brand dealer inventory levels peaked at 2.5 months in April 2017 and remained high at 1.9 months in May after aggressive destocking. Chang'an Automobile, for example, has voluntarily cut its production and wholesale sales since April to help dealers clear old models before new product launches in 2H17. The company's wholesale volume declined by 27.6% yoy in April and 25.8% yoy in May. We believe Chinese automakers have strong incentives to keep dealer inventories under control in 2017 in light of weak demand and new automobile distribution rules that prohibit manufacturers from setting dealer sales targets or pushing inventories to dealers, which come into effect from 1 July 2017.

The brief submitted by 50 companies to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan marks the first time such a large group of businesses has backed arguments about employment discrimination that LGBT groups and the administration of former President Barack Obama have made for years. The companies said bias against gay employees is widespread, with more than 40 percent of gay workers reporting harassment and other forms of discrimination in various studies. The lack of a federal law clearly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has hindered recruitment in states that have not adopted their own, the companies said.   Recognizing that our uniform federal law protects LGBT employees would benefit individual businesses, and the economy as a whole, by removing an artificial barrier to the recruitment, retention, and free flow of talent,  wrote the companies' lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. The companies asked the 2nd Circuit to revive a lawsuit by the estate of Donald Zarda, who claimed he was fired from his job as a skydiving instructor on Long Island after he told a customer he was gay and she complained. Zarda died in a skydiving accident after filing the lawsuit. In April, a panel of three 2nd Circuit judges dismissed Zarda's case, saying the court's decision in a separate case in 2000 that said discrimination against gay workers is not a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 foreclosed his claims. But last month, the full court, which can overturn the prior ruling, agreed to review the case. That came weeks after a different appeals court in Chicago became the first to rule that Title VII protects gay workers.  Zarda's former employer, Altitude Express Inc, says Congress did not intend for Title VII to apply to gay workers when it passed the law more than 50 years ago, and courts do not have the power to change the meaning of the law. A different appeals court in Atlanta, Georgia, is currently considering whether to revisit a March decision that dismissed a lawsuit by a former hospital security guard who said she was harassed and forced to quit because she is gay.

China, however, is making a strategic push into FLNG, aiming to become the lowest cost seller of the complex floating plants and lead the global rollout of a technique that remains in its infancy, with only one project in commercial production so far. The country needs gas as a cleaner alternative to coal under a drive to improve air quality in its cities, and has already lent $12 billion to Russia's conventional Yamal LNG project in the Arctic as U.S. sanctions scared away Western banks. It has also lent or committed almost $4 billion to three FLNG schemes off the African coast. In two more African projects costing a total of $3 billion, it plans not only to provide the funding, but also build the production platforms.  We see a real commitment to FLNG in China both from the construction side and from the LNG consumption side where decreasing costs mean potentially lower cost LNG,  said Steve Lowden, chairman of Jersey-based NewAge which is planning FLNG projects off Congo Republic and Cameroon. China already dominates the global market for solar panels and is a major supplier of coal-fired power plants, aided by easy money, cheaper labor and state support. Now, with Beijing pushing President Xi Jinping's  Belt and Road  vision of expanding trade links between Asia, Africa and Europe, it is turning to FLNG to bring high technology work to its shipyards and create jobs - a strategic priority. FLNG is also attractive to resource-rich but debt-burdened African countries. Projects can sail into place, drop anchor, and begin exporting for much less than the cost of onshore plants, the price of which quadrupled in the decade to 2013. That, at least, is the theory. The reality is that the technology remains complex. Royal Dutch Shell's mammoth Prelude FLNG plant, for example will be aboard the world's biggest floating structure, but must squeeze the equipment into a quarter of the space occupied by an LNG plant on dry land. Wave motion and ocean currents add to the difficulties.     The $12.6 billion Prelude project, which is due to start operating off Australia in 2018, is typical of those conceived during the era of high energy prices. However, spot LNG prices have fallen 70 percent since early 2014 and are expected to remain under pressure or drop further due to extra supply from new conventional plants in Australia and the United States. Despite this, some producers and buyers are banking on the glut ending early in the next decade, although they don't want to lock themselves into big projects, preferring smaller, more flexible ones like in Africa. The only operational FLNG project launched in Malaysia last year, with construction of the floating platform costing around $1.6-$1.7 billion. Bankers say this is still too expensive and if the Chinese can build one for $1 billion, they would corner the market. Established Shipyards With new investments in costly conventional LNG plants on hold, the only two production projects to advance this year are floating types, in Mozambique and Equatorial Guinea. Both are largely backed by Chinese loans although the platforms are being built by more established Asian shipyards. Lowden said the two NewAge projects will be wholly financed by Chinese companies and this time also built in Chinese shipyards.  They are more than fully able to handle such projects,  he said.  Still, Dutch offshore engineer SBM and JGC of Japan will partner with the Chinese players, including China Offshore Oil Engineering & Construction Ltd. NewAge expects to sanction both the projects next year. Last year, China's Wison Offshore & Marine completed the first-ever FLNG ship but it remains unused following the cancellation of a project in Colombia it was intended for. Very Deep Pockets As typical Western sources of funding have slowed due to the weak state of the shipping business, highly-capitalized Chinese players believe the market has reached the bottom and are keen to step up lending before the cycle turns and pushes up costs.  The difference is that in the West banks lend at the top of the market when they have most liquidity, but in China they're smarter and put money in at the bottom,  a financier who advises  Chinese lenders on LNG shipping deals said.  This month, Chinese banks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Bank of China committed around 1.75 billion to project finance the Coral South FLNG project in Mozambique, bankers said. ICBC declined comment while BOC did not respond to a request for comment. By contrast Western commercial banks provided just $200 million in uncovered debt to Coral, to be developed by Italy's Eni, instead of an originally proposed $1.9 billion. They cited uncertainties around FLNG technology and a public debt crisis in Mozambique. Adam Byrne, Managing Director at ING Bank, said Chinese lenders  have very deep pockets indeed .  If they decide to, they can support something for even a billion or a billion and a half dollars,  Byrne told a shipping conference earlier this month. Africa and Beyond The next big African deal, in Equatorial Guinea, is being financed by China State Shipbuilding Corp with a $1.2 billion loan for Fortuna FLNG, bankers say. This project - which is being developed by UK-listed Ophir Energy, shipping firm Golar LNG and oil services group Schlumberger - will produce 2.2 million tonnes of LNG a year and is expected to be sanctioned within weeks. China State Shipbuilding Corp (CSSC) also lent $960 million to Golar LNG in 2015 for the first-ever conversion of a conventional LNG tanker into an FLNG platform, which is set to enter operation this year in Cameroon. CSSC declined comment. All these projects were awarded to established shipbuilders in South Korea, Singapore or Japan, but the experience sets up Chinese developers to take the lead on other projects in Africa and beyond, say consultants and industry sources. Equatorial Guinea sees scope for another two FLNG projects, its petroleum minister has said, while BP and joint venture partner Kosmos Energy are also eyeing two in the waters of Senegal and Mauritania. China also has plans for conventional LNG production in Africa. Chinese conglomerate Poly-GCL has begun construction of an onshore LNG facility in Djibouti which will export Ethiopian gas to China, according to Poly-GCL's website.

The price of a barrel of oil has dropped nearly 20 percent between January and June and is closing in on its largest slide in the first half of any year in the last 20 years. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, a near-2 million barrel per day cut in output by the world's largest producers and the seasonally strong summer demand period in full swing have not been enough to rescue the price from its lowest level in seven months. A bear market is theoretically defined by an asset price falling by 20 percent or more from a peak, a box the oil price has ticked given the drop of nearly 21 percent since the 2017 high of $58.37 struck in early January. But nothing can fall forever and the old markets adage of  what goes down must, at some point, come up  must surely prove correct eventually.  We're at a peak of bearish headlines and that usually a sign that the bottom is near,  SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said. Google Trends shows that queries for  oil bear market  on its Google search engine have rocketed to their highest since mid-January 2016, exactly the point at which the Brent price hit a near-13 year low of $27 a barrel before rallying.

In the U.S. crude market, the short position held by money managers has doubled in just two months to the equivalent of nearly 190 million barrels, while in the Brent market, investors are sitting on a record short position of 169 million barrels.

But there have been plenty of reasons for oil traders and investors to be gloomy. A relentless rise in U.S. drilling activity, coupled with resurgent production from both Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members that have been excluded from the supply deal on the grounds that their output was cut by forces beyond their control, have scuppered OPEC's efforts to force a large global overhang of crude and refined products to drain. While the prospect of a barrage of money betting on a drop in the price may seem ominous, any open short position can potentially be closed, and bring with it a rise in the price, unlike an open long position which can trigger a drop if closed.  When looking at (futures) data, one would certainly get the impression that care is warranted as positioning has become relatively one-sided,  JBC Energy said in a note.

If coal is dying, how come there is an increasingly heated bidding war going on for Rio Tinto's coal mines in Australia? Here's another question, this time for the pro-coal lobby. If coal still has a viable long-term future as an energy source, how come the world's biggest planned new mine is now hostage to whether the Australian government decides to loan it money? Reconciling these two questions may seem like a challenge but both the battle for Rio Tinto's existing mines and the struggles of India's Adani to build its Carmichael project neatly show where coal currently finds itself. Rio's mines in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney are attractive to both Glencore and China's Yancoal because they are likely to be profitable for the remaining life of the pits, which is expected to be around 20 years. The Rio mines already have all the necessary infrastructure, being connected by rail to the major export harbor of Newcastle, the world's largest coal export port. They also have existing customers for the high quality thermal coal used to generate electricity, including utilities in Japan, which have preferred long-term supply agreements over the more volatile spot shipments that are more characteristic of deals to sell to major importers China and India. In some ways the Rio mines up for sale are insulated from the downturn in global coal demand expected over the next 30 years, because they supply fuel to customers who are likely to be among the last to switch off coal-fired generators, assuming renewables do eventually succeed in killing off the polluting fuel. Acquiring an existing asset is likely far more attractive to a company such as Glencore than developing new mines, with the associated capital costs and inevitable opposition from environmental groups. Glencore raised its offer for Rio's Hunter Valley mines to $2.675 billion in cash on June 23, making its bid some $225 million more than Yancoal's proposal. Rio said it would study the revised Glencore offer, having previously accepted the lower Yancoal bid on the grounds that it could be completed more quickly as it had regulatory approvals. Coal May Be Dying, but It's Going to Linger It may seem incongruous to environmentalists that there is a bidding war for something that has been declared a dying industry, but there is still a medium-term future for coal, and Glencore and Yancoal are trying to profit from that. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its medium-term coal market report in December that it still expects growth in coal demand up to 2021, albeit at a considerably slower rate. The rise in coal demand is likely to be driven by India and Southeast Asia, according to the IEA, with top consumer China actually using less by 2021 than in 2015. The IEA expects global coal demand to be 5.636 billion tonnes of coal equivalent in 2021, up from 5.4 billion in 2015, equating to an average annual growth rate of 0.6 percent, down from 2.5 percent over the decade to 2015. Like all forecasts, the IEA's estimates can be undone by changing circumstances, and it does appear to be the case that renewable energy sources like solar and wind are making faster than initially expected inroads, especially in India. It's this mounting uncertainty that is making it hard for Adani to get its planned 25-million tonne a year Carmichael mine in Queensland state to a stage where it can actually start construction. While the Indian conglomerate has taken what it termed a final investment decision on the $4 billion mine, it's also likely that it won't go ahead unless support from Australia's federal government is forthcoming. Specifically Adani wants close to $1 billion in loans from the government in order to build some 400 kms (240 miles) of new rail track to link the mine to the planned export port. Adani has already secured an undisclosed agreement with the Queensland state government that is believed to lower the burden of royalty payments, especially in the mine's early years of operation. Even if the federal government does lend the money, the Adani mine appears to be on somewhat shaky ground, given that its intended export market of India has a government with a stated policy goal of cutting coal imports to zero. While Australian governments have in the past assisted with infrastructure projects, the Adani mine was supposed to be proof that the private sector could pull off a major project with only supportive government regulation and not cash. There is still a good chance that the federal government will pony up the cash for Adani, given the ruling Liberal/National coalition has several pro-coal lawmakers and would like the credit from the jobs that will come with building the mine. But Carmichael may also be the last of its kind, given how prolonged and difficult its birth has been, with a well-funded environmental campaign against the mine and ongoing questions about its viability. It's hard to see any commercial bank being willing to fund a massively costly coal project in the future, given both the uncertainty over long-term demand and the negative publicity that is sure to be generated. But oddly enough, the travails of getting a new coal project off the ground probably makes the jostling over existing mines more likely, as companies seek to extract the last dollars available from coal's twilight.

As of June 25, the producers of TR Crop Watch – which follows the weekly crop progress for two farmers in Illinois and one in Minnesota – are expecting to harvest merely an average-yielding corn and soybean crop this year since the weather has not been entirely cooperative. Recent conditions have also prompted one grower to cut expectations for his corn yield. Cooler weather in recent days has slowed growth for corn and soybeans in Minnesota, but Illinois producers are generally welcoming of the cooler temperatures at this time – especially since many of the fields remain dry. Although storms and rain targeted Illinois last week, their localized nature meant that many missed out on the good soaking that has been needed since late last month. Farmer A noted that some of his eastern Illinois fields are on the drier side, while others were too wet to spray with chemicals last week – a good demonstration of the isolated storm effects.  The producers - known as Farmers A, B and C – assign condition scores every week to each field, similar to the system used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The ratings are: excellent – 5, good – 4, fair – 3, poor – 2, very poor – 1. They also give their best estimation of yield potential. The yield ratings are: yields well above average – 5, slightly above – 4, average – 3, slightly below – 2, well below average – 1. Farmer a – East Central Illinois Farmer A corn, June 18 versus June 25: (tmsnrt.rs/2tNkNLa) Farmer A soybeans, June 18 versus June 25: (tmsnrt.rs/2segbfa) Farmer A’s Champaign County, Illinois, corn stands 6 feet (1.8 m) tall as of June 25, representing growth of 1.5 feet (0.46 m) on the week. The corn is about 10 days away from forming tassels, which marks the beginning of pollination. Weather was highly favorable over the past week, with moderate temperatures and 1.5 inches (38 mm) of rain.  A’s biggest concern for this field would be if the heat were to return, so he does not mind the continuation of cooler temperatures this week, which he views as positive for development.  A’s soybeans grew 3 inches (76 mm) this week and are now 14 inches (0.36 m) tall. The plants have not yet begun flowering – which marks the beginning of the reproductive stage – but other earlier-planted fields in his area have started.  The recent and expected cool weather is a neutral factor for the soybeans, in A’s opinion. He believes that cooler temperatures when the flowering stage begins – if coupled with drier conditions – can be more harmful to reproduction than hot temperatures accompanied by lots of rain. The favorable weather over the past week led A to put his corn and soybean condition ratings back at 4 from 3 the previous week, but he still holds an average view of yield for both, maintaining the 3-rating. Farmer B – South Central Minnesota Farmer B corn, June 18 versus June 25: (tmsnrt.rs/2temhky) Farmer B soybeans, June 18 versus June 25: (tmsnrt.rs/2ses2K7) Farmer B holds the most negative view of the recent and expected cooler temperatures, as they are delaying the growth of his corn and soybean field, located in Freeborn County, Minnesota. His soybeans did not grow at all over the last week because of the cooler weather, remaining at 7 inches (178 mm) tall on June 25. A lot of this had to do with the fact that B sprayed these beans with weed-killing herbicide last week, which temporarily browns the leaves and slows growth as the plants ingest the chemicals. But once warm weather returns, the plants resume growth and regain their green color. This is why Farmer B needs warmer weather for his soybeans, which are still in the vegetative state.  B’s corn is now 30 inches (0.76 m) tall compared with 22 inches (0.56 m) the week before. This field is now about 20 to 25 days away from pollination, and despite receiving about 0.7 inch (18 mm) of rain last week, warm weather is desired as the corn is still advancing slowly. Last week’s high temperatures in B’s area were in the mid-60s F and lows were in the high 40s F. The biggest concern B has for his crops is that it needs to warm up, but he is still optimistic about yield, which he left unchanged at 4 for both crops. He still rates the condition of both fields as a 5. If given the choice between hot and wet weather versus cool and dry as the corn pollination and soybean reproductive stages begin, B would prefer hot and wet, because cool and dry can be worse for both crops during that period.  Farmer C – Southeast Illinois Farmer C corn, June 18 versus June 25: (tmsnrt.rs/2sJ8SzO) Farmer C corn, June 18 versus June 25, lower quality soil: (tmsnrt.rs/2temV1K) Farmer C soybeans, June 18 versus June 25: (tmsnrt.rs/2sesLuS) Farmer C’s Crawford County, Illinois, corn field was largely missed by last week’s storm activity, which produced about 0.3 inch (8 mm) of rain on Friday and was the only accumulation for the week. Sufficient soaking rains are still badly needed in his area, but the cooler temperatures last week prevented the condition from deteriorating much further.  Corn in C’s sample spot is now 6 feet (1.8 m) tall compared with 4.5 feet (1.4 m) the week prior, but some of the corn on lower-quality soil is only 4 feet (1.2 m) tall. This is only prevalent in about 20 percent of the field, but C says the yield on this spot could be cut in half from expectations. As such, C reduced his view on corn yield to a 2 from a 3 last week, as he believes average yield may no longer be possible based on the adverse weather conditions up until this point. He left the condition rating unchanged at 3. Cooler weather over the next week will be positive for both corn and soybeans, since the area has been so dry. Corn is about seven days away from producing tassels, and the soybeans have entered the beginning stage of reproduction as flowers have begun to appear. C’s soybeans are knee-high as of June 25 compared with about 14 inches (0.36 m) in the previous week. C left his soybean condition rating unchanged on the week at 4, but lowered his view on yield to a 3 from 4 last week. Follow Along Be sure to check back for future updates.

The final rating on the notes is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. The notes are rated in line with Baidu's senior unsecured rating of 'A' on RWN as they will rank pari passu with the issuer's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The proceeds from the proposed senior unsecured notes will be used for debt repayment and for general corporate purposes. The RWN will be resolved when management has provided further information on its wholly owned Financial Services Group's (FSG) expansion plans, risk control policies and procedures, and capital structure. We may affirm the ratings at their current level or downgrade the ratings, although any downgrade is likely to be a single notch. Our review will take into account Baidu's strong net cash position, which provides a cushion to fund potential losses in the FSG. KEY RATING DRIVERS Placed on Negative Watch: Fitch placed Baidu's Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and 'A' foreign-currency senior unsecured rating on RWN on 31 May 2017. The RWN reflects Fitch's belief that the rapid growth in Baidu's financial services activities under its FSG has increased Baidu's overall business risk. The risk profile of the financial services activities is significantly higher than the risk profile of Baidu's core internet services, such as search services, online video and transaction services. Elevated Business Risk: The FSG sells wealth management products (WMPs), which are mostly fixed-income products with short tenors of up to 12 months, and operates a micro-lending business. Baidu's wealth management business is similar to that of many Chinese banks and WMPs are part of the shadow banking system in China. As with Chinese banks, Baidu does not need to set aside large capital against potential defaults on its WMPs. Baidu sells WMPs to retail investors and reinvests most of the funds via a third-party trust company into money market investments, other fixed-income investments and corporate borrowers. Although we understand that Baidu is not legally bound to pay the target return on the WMPs to investors, we believe the potential damage to the company's reputation can be large. Therefore, we think Baidu may have to compensate WMP investors if the WMPs fail to achieve the target returns. We also believe the risk profile of Baidu's micro-lending business is higher than Baidu's core business, as its loans and cash credits to consumers are unsecured. Rapid Growth in WMPs: Baidu's FSG business has grown from assets of CNY12 billion at end-2016 to CNY25 billion at end-March 2017, and we expect both the FSG's WMP assets and micro-loan book to continue expanding rapidly, at least in the short term. WMPs continue to proliferate in China as there is abundant liquidity, but a scarcity of high-yielding assets in which to invest. WMPs have become an alternative form of financing for projects or investments that would not qualify for bank loans. A large exposure to WMPs may make Baidu vulnerable to asset-quality shocks, especially as loss events rise. Contingent Loss-absorption Capacity: Our review to resolve the RWN will address Baidu's capacity to absorb losses in the FSG operations to ensure that if the FSG underperformed, the additional funding required would not be a big enough drain on cash from Baidu's core operations to threaten the 'A' rating. We believe Baidu's net cash position will be increasingly important, as it will be the primary source of contingent loss-absorption capacity. At end-2016, Baidu's net cash totalled CNY23 billion, excluding payables to WMP customers of CNY7 billion, which were funds from retail investors entrusted to Baidu to invest in WMPs. DERIVATION SUMMARY Baidu's credit profile compares favourably with its internet peers, such as eBay Inc. (BBB/Stable), Expedia, Inc. (BBB-/Stable), but is weaker than Alibaba Group Holding Limited (A+/Stable) and Tencent Holdings Limited (A+/Stable). Baidu's cash-generation ability is weaker than that of Alibaba and Tencent. Baidu's ratings benefit from its dominance in China's search engine market, but it faces challenges to diversify its business lines and revenue sources from its core search services. It has assumed higher risk in the expansion into online-to-offline businesses and financial services activities, which has resulted in high gross leverage and lower profitability than Alibaba and Tencent. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue compounded annual growth rate of about 17% in 2016-2019 - Operating EBIT margin of 16%-17% in 2017-2019 - Annual capex of CNY16 billion-19 billion in 2017-2019 - No cash dividend and the USD2 billion share buyback programme to be completed by end-2017 - Net cash position to be sustained in 2017-2019 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Positive rating action is currently not envisaged. Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Fitch plans to resolve the RWN when it has further information on the FSG's expansion plans, risk control policies and procedures, and future capital structure. The final ratings will depend on Baidu's risk control of its financial services activities, the pace of the FSG's growth and the availability of loss-absorption capacity in terms of net cash position. We may affirm the ratings at their current level or downgrade the ratings, although any downgrade is likely to be a single notch. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: We expect Baidu to continue to maintain a large net cash balance. At end-March 2017, Baidu had cash and short-term investments of CNY91 billion. This compared with total debt of CNY58 billion, which included redeemable non-controlling interests at subsidiaries. Mostly US Dollar Unsecured Debt: Excluding payables to WMP customers of CNY20 billion, Baidu's total debt was about CNY58 billion, with the vast majority unsecured and denominated in US dollars at end-March 2017. US dollar unsecured notes totalled USD4.75 billion and US dollar unsecured bank loans amounted to USD1.5 billion. In addition, iQiyi, a majority-owned online video subsidiary of Baidu, issued USD1.5 billion convertible notes to third parties in January 2017. Of the US dollar debt, USD750 million of 2.25% unsecured notes and USD500 million of unsecured bank loans will be due in next few months before end-2017.

The Fed chair is scheduled to take part in a discussion on global economic issues at London's Royal Academy, and is seen likely to stick to her positive views on the U.S. economy despite a recent batch of weak U.S. economic data, supporting the Fed's forecast of raising interest rates once more this year.  Hedge funds are already selling yen this week, and positive comments from Yellen could give them an excuse to sell even more,  said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo. That selling helped the dollar touch a fresh one-month high of 111.95 yen early on Tuesday. It was last up 0.1 percent at 111.94 yen. But U.S. data on Monday gave investors reason to be cautious about buying the dollar. New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter. After the weak data raised concerns about falling inflation and lacklustre growth, long-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields dropped to seven-month lows and the yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds fell to its flattest level since 2007. Still, Fed officials doggedly stuck to their hawkish scripts. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Monday that a recent slowdown in U.S. inflation was mainly due to one-off factors and should not prevent further increases in rates. Financial conditions have loosened in the past year despite the Fed raising interest rates three times since December, which is another reason to continue tightening, New York Fed President William Dudley said in remarks published on Monday. The euro licked its wounds after contrastingly dovish comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. It was last steady on the day at $1.1180, above its overnight low of $1.1172. Draghi's remarks in a town-hall session with university students in Lisbon included saying that super low rates create jobs, foster growth and benefit borrowers. He rejected calls to exit super easy monetary policy quickly, arguing that premature tightening would lead to a fresh recession and more inequality. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was flat on the day at 97.432 .

The legislation passed the Senate by a nearly unanimous margin two weeks ago, looking like it might complicate President Donald Trump's desire for warmer relations with Moscow, where officials have denounced new sanctions. A White House official said the Trump administration felt some provisions in the bill would interfere with its ability to use sanctions to try to influence Russia.  There are some provisions in the Senate bill that would unprecedentedly impair Treasury's ability to wield its sanctions tools, risk endangering the transatlantic sanctions coalition, and weaken the State Department's ability to credibly signal that we would calibrate our sanctions in response to Russian behavior,  the official said in an emailed statement, requesting anonymity. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a co-author of the legislation, said he hoped for progress within the next day or two on a procedural issue that has kept the House from taking up the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes the new sanctions against Russia. The measure must pass the House, where Trump's fellow Republicans control a larger majority than in the Senate, before it can be sent for Trump to sign into law or veto. House Republican leaders said last week that the Senate bill violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the House, something known as a  blue slip  violation. House aides also said leadership had not yet decided whether to vote on the Senate bill once the  blue slip  issue was resolved, or first refer it to House committees, which could further delay or change it. Democrats said they were skeptical about the  blue slip  explanation, noting that the issue had resolved very quickly in recent years for other bills. Corker said Senate Republicans remained solidly behind the legislation.  I've heard no one here have second thoughts, by the way  he told Reuters.  If you find one, please tell me.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined comment during a news briefing on Monday on whether the administration would support the sanctions bill.

LOUIS -- Coming into Monday's makeup game, the St. Louis Cardinals led the majors in making outs on the bases with a whopping 62. Tommy Pham flipped that narrative for a day with a daring dash around the bases that helped shape the game. Manufacturing St. Louis' first run without a hit, Pham set the tone for its 8-2 rout of the Cincinnati Reds in Busch Stadium.  That stuff fires us up,  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.  We talk about it all the time -- have your antennae up, look to make something happen. You love to see him use all the tools he has. Just a big game all the way around for him.  Pham worked a leadoff walk from Brandon Finnegan (1-1). On Randal Grichuk's routine fly ball to center, Pham waited for Patrick Kivlehan to throw the ball to a cutoff man in shallow left-center, then bolted for second and beat a hurried throw there. With Finnegan paying little attention to him, Pham then stole third with Stephen Piscotty at the plate. To cap his speedy tour, Pham raced home when ball four to Piscotty clanked off Devin Mesoraco's glove for a passed ball. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at CardinalsCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchOne run, no hits, one excited baseball team.  That was great,  third baseman Jedd Gyorko said of Pham.  I haven't seen something like that in a while. He made great hustle plays, got us on the board early.  Perhaps still rattled by Pham's legs, Finnegan then ran head-long into Gyorko's bat. A 3-1 sinker was punished, flying 413 feet to left-center field for Gyorko's 12th homer of the year and a 3-0 St. Louis lead on one hit. The day only hinted at getting better once for Cincinnati (31-44). The first of two sacrifice flies by Adam Duvall in the fourth got it on the board, but Michael Wacha regained control with consecutive strikeouts of Eugenio Suarez and Scott Schebler. Finnegan, who hadn't pitched in the majors since April 15 due to a left shoulder injury, then left three pitches into his half of the fourth when he suffered a left triceps strain while throwing ball two to Paul DeJong.  About halfway through the third, I could feel it,  Finnegan said.  I thought I could throw through it. I thought I was just getting fatigued. But the last pitch just didn't feel right. The manager knew something was going on.  Austin Brice relieved, but offered none of it. The Cardinals touched him for nine hits and five runs in two-plus innings. Pham's two-out RBI single in the fourth was followed by Grichuk's towering two-run homer just over the center field wall. It was the sixth homer for Grichuk and his second in as many days since being recalled from Triple-A Memphis Sunday. Given ample run support, Wacha (4-3) produced an outing good enough to win a tighter game. In completing six innings for just the second time in seven starts, he allowed five hits and a run, walking one and fanning five.  I felt like I was back on top of the ball, throwing downhill into the zone,  Wacha said.  I got some soft contact, some ground balls. I felt like I'd been putting a lot of pressure on the bullpen lately with short starts.  Grichuk and Gyorko tacked on RBI singles in the sixth for an 8-1 lead. St. Louis (35-40) won its second straight game ahead of a six-game stretch against Arizona and Washington. The Cardinals are only 10-19 against opponents with records north of .500. Finnegan lasted only three innings, allowing three hits and three runs. He walked four and fanned two, throwing just 31 of 58 pitches before injury was piled on top of repeated insult. Since sweeping a four-game series from St. Louis in early June, the Reds are 2-14.  I definitely didn't want to come out like I did,  Finnegan said.  I don't think it is anything too serious.  NOTES: Cincinnati activated LHP Brandon Finnegan (left shoulder) from the 60-day DL to start Monday's game. It made room for him by optioning RHP Lisalverto Bonilla to Triple-A Louisville. ... St. Louis gave 1B Matt Carpenter a rest day, marking just the eighth time in 75 games he wasn't in the starting lineup. Rookie Luke Voit made his first big league start in Carpenter's place. ... The Reds transferred RHP Bronson Arroyo (right shoulder) from the 10-day DL to the 60-day DL. Arroyo originally went on the DL on June 19 with a 3-6 record and 7.35 ERA.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-cardinals-writethru-idUSMTZED6R6H04OT"},

The legislation passed the Senate by a nearly unanimous margin two weeks ago, looking like it might complicate President Donald Trump's desire for warmer relations with Moscow, where officials have denounced new sanctions. A White House official said the Trump administration felt some provisions in the bill would interfere with its ability to use sanctions to try to influence Russia.  There are some provisions in the Senate bill that would unprecedentedly impair Treasury's ability to wield its sanctions tools, risk endangering the transatlantic sanctions coalition, and weaken the State Department's ability to credibly signal that we would calibrate our sanctions in response to Russian behavior,  the official said in an emailed statement, requesting anonymity. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a co-author of the legislation, said he hoped for progress within the next day or two on a procedural issue that has kept the House from taking up the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes the new sanctions against Russia. The measure must pass the House, where Trump's fellow Republicans control a larger majority than in the Senate, before it can be sent for Trump to sign into law or veto. House Republican leaders said last week that the Senate bill violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the House, something known as a  blue slip  violation. House aides also said leadership had not yet decided whether to vote on the Senate bill once the  blue slip  issue was resolved, or first refer it to House committees, which could further delay or change it. Democrats said they were skeptical about the  blue slip  explanation, noting that the issue had resolved very quickly in recent years for other bills. Corker said Senate Republicans remained solidly behind the legislation.  I've heard no one here have second thoughts, by the way  he told Reuters.  If you find one, please tell me.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined comment during a news briefing on Monday on whether the administration would support the sanctions bill.

Terry Branstad, a former Iowa governor, has been described by Beijing as an  old friend  of China. Branstad was confirmed on May 22 as President Donald Trump's new ambassador to China but his arrival date has yet to be announced.  Resolving the bilateral trade imbalance, stopping the North Korea threat, and expanding people-to-people ties will be my top priorities,  Branstad said in the video message, which was released on a popular Chinese video-streaming platform. Trump has placed high hopes on China and its president, Xi Jinping, exerting greater influence on North Korea, although he said last week Chinese efforts to rein in the reclusive North's nuclear and missile programs had failed. China's foreign ministry regularly says that Beijing is doing all that it can with regard to North Korea by implementing United Nations Security Council sanctions, while also pushing for greater dialogue to reduce tensions. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he had pressed China to ramp up economic and political pressure on North Korea during his meeting with top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Washington last week.  We face many of the same challenges. A strong U.S.-China relationship can contribute to solutions,  Branstad said in the video, without giving details about how he hoped to work with China. Branstad also recounted his three decades of engagement with China, from his first visit there in 1984 to hosting Xi, then a county-level Communist Party leader, in Iowa in 1985, and then again in 2012 when Xi was vice president. Trump pledged during his campaign to take a tough stance on Chinese trade practices deemed unfair to the United States, but his rhetoric softened after a friendlier-than-expected meeting with Xi in Florida in April. Shortly after their meeting, Trump said he had told Xi that China would get a better trade deal if it worked to rein in the North. China is neighboring North Korea's lone major ally. The United States ran a trade deficit of $347 billion with China last year, U.S. Treasury figures show.

Republican House of Representatives Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry released a proposed defense policy bill intended to address military readiness and the Department of Defense's unfunded requirements list, which is hovering at $33 billion, House staff told reporters on Monday. The $621.5 billion proposed base spending plan for the Pentagon and defense related expenses at the U.S. Department of Energy was more than 13 percent higher than the 2018 defense spending budget cap of $549 billion which would need to be raised by Congress for the legislation to be enacted. The proposal also included $75 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) to pay for ongoing wars. This funding would not count against the budget caps. The House proposal would put total defense-related spending at $696 billion for fiscal 2018.  Trump's budget proposal included $65 billion for OCO funding, and total spending of $668 billion.

It would increase the Army by 10,000, to 486,000 active service troops.  The proposal would allow the Pentagon to buy a total of 22 Boeing Co F-18s, up from 14 in Trump's budget proposal. The proposal also gives the Navy authorization for an additional five ships above Trump's original budget request. The ships include an Arleigh Burke class destroyer made by General Dynamics Corp and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc and a total of three Littoral Combat Ships built by Lockheed Martin and Australia's Austal Ltd. The proposal also includes defense acquisition reform measures that would change how the Pentagon buys services and would allow the military to buy commercial off the shelf products from existing business to business e-commerce markets, such as Amazon.com Inc or W W Grainger Inc.

(Reuters) - SCANA Corp said on Monday it extended its assessment for six weeks of an unfinished U.S. nuclear power plant being built for the utility by a unit of Toshiba Corp, which is seeking to cut ties to the financially disastrous project. The South Carolina project, known as VC Summer, and a similar half-finished nuclear power plant in Georgia known as Vogtle, are billions of dollars over budget and pushed Toshiba's Westinghouse Electric Co LLC into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March. SCANA said on Monday it would extend to Aug. 10 its assessment agreement under which the utility will pay temporarily for construction to continue at VC Summer without cost to Westinghouse. The agreement was scheduled to expire this week. Cayce, South Carolina-based SCANA said the extension would give it time to determine  the most prudent path forward  for the project and said it expected to make that decision before October. Westinghouse plans to use the bankruptcy to end its contract for constructing the two power plants, but doing so would trigger guarantee claims against Toshiba. Earlier this month Toshiba agreed to settle its guarantees  with Southern Co, the main owner of the Vogtle project, for $3.7 billion. Toshiba now needs to reach a similar settlement with SCANA and Santee Cooper, the state utility that co-owns VC Summer, to determine its cost for guaranteeing the project. Settling the guarantee claims would put a line under Toshiba's liability for the two projects. The conglomerate has warned it may not survive and is seeking a deal this week to sell its prized memory chip business. Once it extracts itself from construction of the projects, Westinghouse plans to reach a services agreement with the plant owners to provide engineering and procurement to finish the projects, if the owners choose to complete construction. In a court filing, Lisa Donahue, who is overseeing Westinghouse's turnaround, said those services agreements are  expected to provide substantial profitable revenue  for a post-bankruptcy Westinghouse. That potential profit in turn is likely to help attract potential bidders for Westinghouse, raising funds to benefit the owners of the two nuclear power plants. The utilities that own the plants may also get some help from the U.S. Congress. The U.S. House of Representatives last week passed a bill that would extend the current deadline of end-2020 for producing power to qualify for potentially large tax credits.

Barry Cadden, the co-founder and former president of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center, was convicted in March of those crimes by a federal jury in Boston but cleared of the harshest charges he faced, second-degree murder. Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston to sentence Cadden, 50, to 35 years in prison, saying he directed the production of drugs in unsanitary and dangerous ways to boost the compounding pharmacy's profits. His greed and those shortcuts led to 778 patients nationwide being harmed after receiving contaminated steroids, prosecutors said. That includes 76 people who died, they said. Stearns said if he was a victim, he would have wanted the maximum sentence, as some had advocated. He said he spent the weekend reviewing statements from the victims.  The most common word that repeats itself is pain,  he said. But Stearns said he could not allow outrage to interfere with reaching a fair sentence. Some victims expressed disappointment.  It's a slap in the face,  said Dawn Elliott, an Indiana woman who received steroid injections and was subsequently bedridden for over a year.

Researchers examined data on side effects reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2004 to 2016 for products like makeup, sunscreen, tattoos, hair color, perfume, shaving creams and baby care items. Overall, there were a total of 5,144 adverse events, with an average of 396 a year, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.  Side effect reports climbed 78 percent to 706 in 2015, followed by a 300 percent surge to 1,591 adverse events last year, largely driven by complaints about hair care products and WEN products in particular, the study found.   Adverse events to cosmetics matter to patients mostly because nearly everyone uses a cosmetic or personal care product every single day - this includes newborns, infants and pregnant women,  said senior study author Dr. Shuai Xu, a dermatology researcher at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.   Unlike drugs and medical devices, cosmetics permeate daily life,  Xu said by email.  We're exposed to hundreds of chemicals a day from these products.  For the study, Xu and colleagues examined adverse events data in the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition’s Adverse Event Reporting System (CFSAN), a repository made publicly available in 2016. It includes voluntary reports of side effects submitted by consumers and health care professionals.  The three most commonly reported products were hair care, skin care and tattoos. Products that most often involved reports of serious health problems were baby items, which accounted for about half of these cases, followed by personal cleanliness supplies, hair care and hair color.  Hair products, including shampoos, conditioners and styling aids, accounted for 35 percent of all adverse event reports, followed by skin care products, which made up 22 percent of the complaints.  In 2014, the FDA began investigating WEN by Chaz Dean Cleansing Conditioners after directly receiving 127 consumer reports, researchers note.  Later, the FDA learned that the manufacturer had already received 21,000 complaints of alopecia and scalp irritation. Hair loss was also reported by consumers. The product remains on the market with the FDA currently seeking additional consumer reports.  Limitations of the study include the lack of data on what caused side effects, the authors note. Researchers were also unable to distinguish between reports from consumers and from health professionals. It's also possible that the study underestimates the total number of adverse events or the number of serious side effects because reporting isn't mandatory and companies and manufacturers are not required to share complaints they receive with the FDA, the authors note. The results suggest that better cosmetic surveillance is needed, the researchers conclude.  Approaches that might help include registering new products with the FDA so regulators know what's out there; making it mandatory for companies to report adverse events to the FDA, and increased funding for the FDA to investigate problems, former FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf and colleagues write in an accompanying editorial.  In the meantime, consumers should read labels carefully, Califf, now a professor at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, said by email.   There is little direct protection, but consumers should read labels, understand what they are buying and focus on companies with established reputations for quality,  Califf said.  A spokesperson for WEN by Chaz Dean styling products told Reuters Health in a statement, “The WEN family cares deeply about our customers. There has been no credible evidence presented to support the false and misleading claims that WEN products cause hair loss . . . WEN by Chaz Dean has been proven safe, and millions of bottles have been sold over the last 16 years. We have consistently cooperated with the FDA and will continue to do so.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2td6imM JAMA Internal Medicine, online June 26, 2017.

When the 46-year-old pulls the container back up, she finds it filled with undrinkable muddy water. Water levels in the well are dwindling fast and not being replenished, she says. Nhari lives in Westlea, a middle-class suburb of the Zimbabwean capital and an area built on wetlands. Like many residents, she has no piped water and relies on the well, which has become more erratic in the face of longer drought. “Since 2015, our wells here started having problems in storing groundwater for longer periods as they began to dry up quickly,” she said.    Residents like Nhari, and a growing number of newcomers to Harare, find themselves in a bind. They need somewhere to live, and developers are all too ready to sell them land in wetland areas. But as construction covers more wetlands, water sources are drying up. Wetlands - which include bogs and swamps - are essential to the well-being of the city, environmentalists say.  They can ease the impacts of a changing climate by helping maintain ground water levels, and protect areas from the worst impacts of floods by absorbing excess water. By law, anyone intending to build on a wetland must apply for a permit from the government's Environmental Management Agency (EMA).  In January, EMA threatened to evict wetland residents in Masvingo, one of the country’s oldest towns, saying their homes had been built without government approval. But in Westlea, Nhari is skeptical about the likelihood of enforcement. “I have lived here for close to 10 years and have not seen any resident being questioned for building on this so-called wetland,” she said. She added that she doesn't know how wetlands function and why they are important.    According to EMA spokesman Steady Kangata, 27 wetland areas in Harare and Chitungwiza, a town 25 km (15 miles) from the Zimbabwean capital, have been partially built on. In Chitungwiza, 14 out of 15 wetlands have been built on, and 13 of Harare's 29 wetlands have been taken over for construction, Kangata told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Approximately 60 percent of Harare and Chitungwiza’s wetlands have been invaded or taken over for construction purposes. All these constructions on wetlands are unlawful,” Kangata said.   The Westlea wetland is an area of 123 hectares (304 acres). It has 87 houses, the first of which was built in 2008, according to the Harare Residents Trust, a nongovernmental organization. Nhari moved into her home in 2009 with her husband, after he bought a 600-square-metre plot from a private landowner. She says she has a deed of sale to prove it – but what she doesn’t have is water. Environmental experts say residents like Nhari are the source of their own problems. “A wetland acts like a sponge which absorbs water and then recharges underground water so that the water table remains high. Construction disrupts this process,” said Sandra Gobvu of Environment Africa, a nongovernmental organization that works in southern Africa to promote sustainable development. When wetland areas are concreted over, much less water is absorbed, Gobvu added. Wetlands also help control flooding by absorbing excess water and releasing it gradually into water bodies, she said. “If we preserved them in their natural state, wetlands would actually help us adapt to the changing climatic conditions,” said Barnabas Mawire, Environment Africa's Zimbabwe country director. He believes that while Zimbabwe’s widespread water problems are due to a number of factors, wetland destruction plays a role.  “Climate change will make future efforts to restore or rehabilitate wetlands more difficult, especially if we continue to destroy them at this rate,” said Mawire.     Environmental activists in Zimbabwe say they are struggling to keep up with the rate of wetlands encroachment. “It is hard to measure the proportion of construction work occurring on wetlands here because daily we wake up to new building activities emerging around many wetlands,” said Liberty Chiura, a member of the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association. Meanwhile, landowners say they are not acting illegally by selling wetlands plots. “We don’t just wake up and start pegging land at wetlands for people without binding permits from local authorities,” said Elton Javangwe, a private landowner based in Harare. “This is part of a farm I bought and later decided to subdivide before selling housing stands, after local authorities and EMA regularized it,” Javangwe said. Mawire said that some construction on wetlands is authorized. “Developers know they have to apply to the Environmental Management Authority for permits to build, and they do get these permits at times,  he said.    However, there are many other people who invade pieces of land without any knowledge that there are wetlands and start construction. And there are others who know, but deliberately ignore what the law says and go on to build,” Mawire added.     He said that as people migrate from the countryside and demand for land in urban areas increases, new residents are unlikely to be aware of the risks of building on wetlands, to themselves and the broader community. “The developer might know, but sadly for many people they only realize the consequences once they finish building and start experiencing floods, cracks and collapse of infrastructure,” said Mawire. Failure to abide by Zimbabwe’s laws governing wetlands can result in a fine of up to $500, imprisonment of up to two years, or both. Minister of Environment, Water and Climate Oppah Muchinguri has the power to serve a written order to stop development on any wetland.     “As government, we are accountable for handling wetlands and we have to accept accountability where we would have failed,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  We now have an inter-ministerial taskforce to investigate the building of properties on wetlands and take possible action in order to protect our threatened wetlands (which are) crucial to restoring water basins,” Muchinguri added.

Plus he misses his friend.  He was a strong guy,  said Gomes, 30.  I miss him, and his commitment to our cause, every day.  Last June, Gomes and hundreds of other Guarani-Kaiowa people gathered for a protest demanding formal ownership over 55,600 hectares of land in Mato Grosso do Sul state in southwestern Brazil. The flat, dry, expanse of savannah - ideal for growing soy or grazing cattle - sits near Brazil's border with Paraguay. Historically, the indigenous activists say it belongs to them. Gomes said Brazil's National Indian Foundation (FUNAI), the government agency responsible for protecting the land rights of indigenous people, had missed its own deadline to demarcate the land, or in essence to ring fence it for indigenous people.  We had gathered to protest our treatment, the human rights violations we suffer,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  That's when the farmers arrived in many cars. They opened fire,  the activist said. Gomes' friend, community leader and healthcare worker Clodiode Aquileu Rodrigues, 26, died in a hail of bullets at the rally, which was held in Caarapó municipality, 273 km (170 miles) from the state capital Campo Grande.  The government only thinks about agribusiness, not us Guarani-Kaiowa,  Gomes said.  We don't have enough land or a place of our own to survive.  Killing Fields Conflicts between indigenous peoples and other land users are by no means unique to Brazil - similar disputes are common in Australia, Mexico, North America and other western countries. However, the scale of recent violence, along with the key role played by farming in Brazil's economy, the often hazy nature of property ownership and what activists consider high levels of impunity make the situation particularly dangerous in South America's largest country. Clodiode Rodrigues was one of 61 land rights campaigners killed across Brazil last year, the highest level of violence since 2003, according to the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT), a Brasilia-based advocacy group linked to the Catholic Church.  Land conflicts in Mato Grosso do Sul and the murder of indigenous leaders are realities that go hand in hand,  Dourados Marco Antonio Delfino de Almeida, a federal prosecutor in the state, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Almeida said the number of killings aimed at indigenous groups in Mato Grosso do Sul has been increasing. Since June 2015, he said, prosecutors had been made aware of at least eight attacks against indigenous communities in the southern region of Mato Grosso do Sul alone.  Since mid-2015, organised groups have been perpetrating violent evictions of indigenous communities,  said Almeida, whose office is responsible for investigating the killings. Farmers groups have formed  private militias  in the state, the prosecutor said. And the tight-knit nature of farming communities makes it particularly difficult to find witnesses. Despite this, more than 40 people have been prosecuted for attacks against indigenous communities in the last five years, he said. Landed Elite The rise in deadly conflicts pitting indigenous people against large farming interests in Mato Grosso do Sul coincides with Brazil's worst recession on record, though agriculture has been one of the few bright spots. In the world's top exporter of beef, soy, chicken and orange juice, agriculture accounts for about 23 percent of Brazil's GDP, more than seven times the global average of 3 percent, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The country's 900,000 indigenous people - who are disproportionately impacted by poverty and other social problems - control about 13 percent of Brazil's territory. And that's more than enough, according to some critics. In Mato Grosso do Sul, farmers say the Guarani-Kaiowa are the ones who occupied their land, not the other way around. Indigenous campaigners are responsible for the violence as they illegally entered private land en masse, say the farmers, who stand by the decision to defend their properties. Belly Full Politicians urge the indigenous campaigners to move on.  Land doesn't fill anyone's belly,  Brazil's justice minister Osmar Serraglio said in March, urging indigenous people to  stop this discussion about lands  and focus on economic opportunities. In his first two months in office, Serraglio held more than 80 meetings with agricultural lobbyists and none with indigenous representatives, according to an analysis by the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper published in May. The lobbying power of agribusiness interests speaks to a dangerous dynamic, said Wendy Wolford, a professor at the U.S. Cornell University who studies land conflicts.  In Brazil, there is sufficient land and food for everyone,  Wolford told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  A political system that keeps some from accessing those resources is institutionalised discrimination with deadly consequences - necropolitics,  she said, referring to the use of power to dictate who lives and who dies. Impunity These power imbalances, coupled with billions of dollars at stake from farm exports, hinder prosecutions, campaigners say. Of more than 1,300 deadly land conflicts in Brazil since 1985, less than 10 percent of cases reached a final conclusion at trial, according to the CPT. Part of the problem in securing convictions is that police officials and land owners in rural areas often move in the same social circles and are hesitant to target each other, said Jeane Bellini, the CPT's national coordinator, who has tracked land violence in Brazil for more than 20 years. In the past decade, the most common victims of rural violence were activists who occupied farmland near big ranches, particularly the well-organised Landless Workers Movement (MST), she said. But that has shifted in the past few years with indigenous groups and other traditional land users now more affected than ever, said Bellini.  Since the government has slowed down the recognition of indigenous lands, communities have found themselves in direct conflict... with modernised agribusiness who are intent on using the land for soy or other monocultures,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Following the killing of his friend, Gomes said federal officials arrested five men thought to have ordered the attack.  Now they are all free,  Gomes said.  It's an ongoing threat to our community.

John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2sI1qoh * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2sIaTMH * Chart 3: tmsnrt.rs/2tcPA76 * Chart 4: tmsnrt.rs/2tcWJoa By John Kemp LONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - “All hope abandon, ye who enter here,” is the warning inscribed above the gate of Hell, according to the Italian poet Dante Aligheri (“The Divine Comedy”, Inferno, Canto III, 1308-1320). Hedge funds and other money managers appear to have entered their own special version of hell and abandoned all hope that OPEC will rebalance the oil market, slashing formerly bullish bets on crude futures and options. Hedge fund managers cut their net long position in the three main futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 109 million barrels in the week to June 20 (tmsnrt.rs/2sI1qoh). Funds have cut their net long position by a total of 161 million barrels over the last three weeks, taking it down to just 389 million barrels, the lowest since Aug. 9, 2016 (tmsnrt.rs/2sIaTMH). Fund managers now hold just two long positions for every one short position, which ranks among the most bearish positions since oil prices started to tumble in the middle of 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/2tcPA76). Extreme bearishness extends to refined fuels, where hedge funds have a net short position of 27 million barrels in U.S. heating oil and a near-record net short position in U.S. gasoline of 21 million barrels. The hedge fund community placed enormous faith in OPEC’s ability to accelerate oil market rebalancing through cuts announced late in 2016 in association with key non-OPEC producers. Fund managers accumulated a record net long position of almost 1 billion barrels by the middle of February only to suffer a sharp reversal in prices starting early the next month. The accumulation of long positions for a second time in April was similarly rewarded with a brutal sell off in oil prices, leaving many fund managers struggling with large losses for the year. OPEC’s decision to leave production unchanged last month, rather than cut more deeply, has sparked a third sell off, and extinguished any remaining bullishness and emboldened short sellers. Hedge funds have embarked on a new cycle of short-selling in Brent and WTI, the eighth since the start of 2015, which has added to the downward pressure on prices. Fund managers have added 77 million barrels of extra short positions in WTI and 59 million barrels in Brent since June 6, according to data from regulators and exchanges. Hedge funds have added short positions faster and more aggressively than during any previous short-selling cycle in the last three years (tmsnrt.rs/2tcWJoa). Short positions across the three major Brent and WTI contracts are now running at the highest level since August 2016 and close to the record short position established in January 2016, just as oil prices reached their lowest point in this cycle. But the extreme pessimism across the entire petroleum complex is raising the risk of a reversal and future rise in prices (just as it did in January 2016). The concentration of short positioning in Brent and WTI is becoming a crowded trade and threatens to spark a rise in prices if and when fund managers try to lock in profits and cover some of those positions. The fundamental outlook appears weak, with U.S. shale drillers continuing to add extra rigs, despite the downturn in prices, but positioning data shows the risk of a short-covering rally is increasing.

Barry Cadden, the co-founder and former president of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center, was convicted in March of those crimes by a federal jury in Boston but cleared of the harshest charges he faced, second-degree murder. Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston to sentence Cadden, 50, to 35 years in prison, saying he directed the production of drugs in unsanitary and dangerous ways to boost the compounding pharmacy's profits. His greed and those shortcuts led to 778 patients nationwide being harmed after receiving contaminated steroids, prosecutors said. That includes 76 people who died, they said. Stearns said if he was a victim, he would have wanted the maximum sentence, as some had advocated. He said he spent the weekend reviewing statements from the victims.  The most common word that repeats itself is pain,  he said. But Stearns said he could not allow outrage to interfere with reaching a fair sentence. Some victims expressed disappointment.  It's a slap in the face,  said Dawn Elliott, an Indiana woman who received steroid injections and was subsequently bedridden for over a year. Pharmacist and co-founder of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center Barry Cadden walks to his car after being sentenced to nine years in jail, beginning in August, for his role in a deadly U.S. meningitis outbreak in 2012, in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. June 26, 2017.Brian SnyderCadden's lawyers sought only three years in prison. In court, he tearfully apologized.  As head of a company that made drugs that killed and sickened these people, I say with full sincerity that it breaks my heart to read about how painful their deaths were,  he said. Slideshow (6 Images)Cadden was one of 14 people tied to Framingham, Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center (NECC) indicted in 2014 following the outbreak. He was one of only two people to face second-degree murder charges. Prosecutors said Cadden, the head pharmacist, ran NECC as a criminal enterprise that sold substandard and non-sterile drugs produced in filthy conditions and shipped to medical facilities nationally. They said Cadden directed the shipment of thousands of vials of contaminated steroids often prescribed for back pain despite knowing they were made in unsafe conditions. Cadden denied wrongdoing. His lawyers said he never intended to sell contaminated drugs. Victims include Penny Laperriere, whose husband Lyn died  after receiving a steroid shot. She told Stearns that what Cadden did was  unforgivable.   Who gave him the right to play God?  the Michigan woman  said.

Republican House of Representatives Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry released a proposed defense policy bill intended to address military readiness and the Department of Defense's unfunded requirements list, which is hovering at $33 billion, House staff told reporters on Monday. The $621.5 billion proposed base spending plan for the Pentagon and defense related expenses at the U.S. Department of Energy was more than 13 percent higher than the 2018 defense spending budget cap of $549 billion which would need to be raised by Congress for the legislation to be enacted. The proposal also included $75 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) to pay for ongoing wars. This funding would not count against the budget caps. The House proposal would put total defense-related spending at $696 billion for fiscal 2018.  Trump's budget proposal included $65 billion for OCO funding, and total spending of $668 billion.  FILE PHOTO: U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry (R-TX), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, addresses a news conference following a House Republican caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, October 21, 2015.Jonathan ErnstIf enacted, the House proposal would mean the Pentagon could commit to buying 17 more F-35 jets from Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin Co for a total of 87 in 2018. It would increase the Army by 10,000, to 486,000 active service troops.  The proposal would allow the Pentagon to buy a total of 22 Boeing Co F-18s, up from 14 in Trump's budget proposal. The proposal also gives the Navy authorization for an additional five ships above Trump's original budget request. The ships include an Arleigh Burke class destroyer made by General Dynamics Corp and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc and a total of three Littoral Combat Ships built by Lockheed Martin and Australia's Austal Ltd. The proposal also includes defense acquisition reform measures that would change how the Pentagon buys services and would allow the military to buy commercial off the shelf products from existing business to business e-commerce markets, such as Amazon.com Inc or W W Grainger Inc. On Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee are slated to meet to discuss and potentially alter the proposal.

Carolina nuclear plant","keywords":"Lisa Donahue,TOSHIBA,ACCOUNTING/WESTINGHOUSE,BANKRUPTCY,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - SCANA Corp said on Monday it extended its assessment for six weeks of an unfinished U.S. nuclear power plant being built for the utility by a unit of Toshiba Corp, which is seeking to cut ties to the financially disastrous project. The South Carolina project, known as VC Summer, and a similar half-finished nuclear power plant in Georgia known as Vogtle, are billions of dollars over budget and pushed Toshiba's Westinghouse Electric Co LLC into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March. SCANA said on Monday it would extend to Aug. 10 its assessment agreement under which the utility will pay temporarily for construction to continue at VC Summer without cost to Westinghouse. The agreement was scheduled to expire this week. Cayce, South Carolina-based SCANA said the extension would give it time to determine  the most prudent path forward  for the project and said it expected to make that decision before October. Westinghouse plans to use the bankruptcy to end its contract for constructing the two power plants, but doing so would trigger guarantee claims against Toshiba. Earlier this month Toshiba agreed to settle its guarantees with Southern Co, the main owner of the Vogtle project, for $3.7 billion. Toshiba now needs to reach a similar settlement with SCANA and Santee Cooper, the state utility that co-owns VC Summer, to determine its cost for guaranteeing the project. Settling the guarantee claims would put a line under Toshiba's liability for the two projects. The conglomerate has warned it may not survive and is seeking a deal this week to sell its prized memory chip business. Once it extracts itself from construction of the projects, Westinghouse plans to reach a services agreement with the plant owners to provide engineering and procurement to finish the projects, if the owners choose to complete construction. In a court filing, Lisa Donahue, who is overseeing Westinghouse's turnaround, said those services agreements are  expected to provide substantial profitable revenue  for a post-bankruptcy Westinghouse. That potential profit in turn is likely to help attract potential bidders for Westinghouse, raising funds to benefit the owners of the two nuclear power plants. The utilities that own the plants may also get some help from the U.S. Congress.

Monsanto vowed to continue its legal fight against the designation, required under a state law known as Proposition 65, and called the decision  unwarranted on the basis of science and the law.   The listing is the latest legal setback for the seeds and chemicals company, which has faced increasing litigation over glyphosate since the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer said that it is  probably carcinogenic  in a controversial ruling in 2015.  Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the scientist leading the IARC’s review knew of fresh data showing no link between glyphosate and cancer. But he never mentioned it, and the agency did not take the information into account because it had yet to be published in a scientific journal. The IARC classed glyphosate as a “probable carcinogen,”  the only major health regulator to do so.  Dicamba, a weed killer designed for use with Monsanto's next generation of biotech crops, is under scrutiny in Arkansas after the state's plant board voted last week to ban the chemical.  OEHHA said the designation of glyphosate under Proposition 65 will proceed following an unsuccessful attempt by Monsanto to block the listing in trial court and after requests for stay were denied by a state appellate court and the California's Supreme Court.  Monsanto's appeal of the trial court's ruling is pending.  Monsanto Co's Roundup is shown for sale in Encinitas, California, U.S., June 26, 2017.Mike Blake This is not the final step in the process, and it has no bearing on the merits of the case. We will continue to aggressively challenge this improper decision,  Scott Partridge, Monsanto's vice president of global strategy, said.  Listing glyphosate as a known carcinogen under California's Proposition 65 would require companies selling the chemical in the state to add warning labels to packaging. Warnings would also be required if glyphosate is being sprayed at levels deemed unsafe by regulators.  Slideshow (5 Images)Users of the chemical include landscapers, golf courses, orchards, vineyards and farms.  Monsanto and other glyphosate producers would have roughly a year from the listing date to re-label products or remove them from store shelves if further legal challenges are lost.  Monsanto has not calculated the cost of any re-labeling effort and does not break out glyphosate sales data by state, Partridge said.  Environmental groups cheered OEHHA's move to list the chemical.   California's decision makes it the national leader in protecting people from cancer-causing pesticides,  said Nathan Donley, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.

An index of consumer confidence produced by polling firm YouGov fell back to just above levels last seen just after last year's shock referendum decision to leave the European Union.  Our preliminary assessment is that economic growth will fall sharply over the coming months and the country will only be saved from recession by strong international trade,  said Douglas McWilliams, deputy chairman at the Centre for Economics and Business Research which produces the index with YouGov. Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to secure a parliamentary majority in the June 8 election, raising the prospect of a weak government, weighed on consumers who were already feeling the strain of higher inflation and weak wage growth, YouGov said.  But the real cause for alarm will be the cooling of the property market, as this is one of the key things that has propped up consumer confidence over the past few years,  Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov Reports, said. YouGov's conclusions were based on data collected between June 9 and June 21. The online polling company conducts around 6,000 online surveys a month. Britain's housing market has come under pressure in recent months. Mortgage lender Nationwide has reported three successive monthly falls in house prices for the first time since 2009, while rival Halifax says annual growth is the lowest since 2013. Britain's economy as a whole initially withstood the shock of the Brexit vote but lost much of its momentum in early 2017. The combination of slow growth and high inflation has put the Bank of England in a difficult spot. Its interest-rate setters split 5-3 this month on the need to raise borrowing costs to see off a rise in inflation. The BoE is waiting to see if exports can offset weaker consumer demand. There was some more encouraging economic news on Tuesday from jobs website Adzuna. For the past two years it has reported year-on-year declines in available wages.

NZX said that feedback from the market indicated that NXT Market and its precursor, NZAX, were not meeting the needs of targeted smaller firms.  The indices, which are home to a combined total of just 22 companies, were designed to let smaller companies raise capital amid less rigorous compliance rules than the broader market.  The NXT Market hasn't developed as quickly or effectively as we had hoped,  NZX Chief Executive Mark Peterson said in a statement.  NZX has been speaking with the market for some time about how we can look to simplify the structure and operation of our equities markets to ensure its design meets the needs of everyone.  Only four firms are listed on the NXT, including manuka honey firm Oceania Natural and mobile phone advertiser Snakk Media. The market was launched in June 2015, targeting small to medium-sized businesses with a market capitalisation of NZ$10 million ($7.3 million) to NZ$100 million. The NZAX, or NZAX Alternative Market, has 18 companies. Launched in 2003, it closed to new listings with the launch of the NXT in 2015.  The NZX will begin a formal consultation process on its market structure in the third quarter, with consolidation the  likely outcome , it said in its statement. It did not immediately set a date for a final decision. The NZX said it may let smaller companies operate under different disclosure rules on the main bourse, but did not specify how that might be possible.   NZX is considering whether differential requirements for smaller companies should be part of the solution and if so how that may be achieved in the context of a simplified equity board structure,  it said.

Disruptions caused by weather, conflict or politics at one of those so-called  chokepoints  could limit food supplies and push up prices, the study by British think-tank Chatham House warned.  The risks are growing as we all trade more with each other and as climate change takes hold,  Laura Wellesley, one of the study's authors, said in a statement. Almost 25 percent of all food eaten around the world is traded on international markets, the report said. The amount of maize, wheat, rice and soybean moved across the world each year is enough to feed some 2.8 million people and more than half it passes through at least one of 14 inland routes, ports, and straits, like the Panama and Suez canals. About 20 percent of global wheat exports, for example, transit via the Turkish Straits, while more than 25 percent of soybean exports is shipped across the Straits of Malacca. But infrastructure at these junctures is often old and ill-suited to cope with natural disasters, which are expected to increase in frequency as the planet warms, said Wellesley. Roads in Brazil, the world's largest exporter of soy bean, for instance, were exposed to the risk of flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains, while U.S. Gulf Coast ports could suffer more storm surges boosted by rising seas, she said. That posed risks for the food security of importing countries and the economies of those exporting food, she added. The report called on governments to invest in  climate-resilient  infrastructure as well as taking other precautionary measures such as diversifying food production and stocks.

If its last stop is one of the region's struggling refineries - an increasingly unlikely prospect - the crude used to produce the gas would have probably arrived by tanker from West Africa. That's because the region's five plants have no pipeline access to U.S. shale fields or Canada's oil sands.  Or the journey to an East Coast gas pump might start instead in North Dakota's Bakken shale fields - which means it could take up to three months, including a stop at a Gulf Coast refinery. The same trip would have been even longer a month ago, before the opening of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.  That line was nearly derailed last year by protesters. Its arduous path to approval provides one case study in the oil industry's struggle to open up a bottleneck holding back resurgent domestic oil production - an outmoded U.S. distribution system.  The equally divisive Keystone XL pipeline provides a more poignant example: First proposed in 2008 to connect Canada's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries, the line may now never get built - despite the enthusiastic backing of U.S. President Donald Trump.  As permitting dragged on for years, oil prices crashed, dimming the prospects for investment in the oil sands. Top firms have since written down or sold off billions of dollars in Canadian production assets and decamped for U.S. shale fields.  Pipeline construction often lags production booms by years - if proposed lines are built at all - because of opposition from environmentalists and landowners, topographic obstacles, and permitting and construction challenges. That forces drillers to limit output or ship oil domestically, usually by rail - which is more costly and arguably less safe.  The crimped production, in turn, costs the economy jobs, keeps prices higher for consumers and stymies the nation's long-held geopolitical goal of reducing dependence on foreign oil.  Obstacles to pipeline construction are coming into sharp focus as resurgent shale firms, after a two-year downturn, are now on pace to take domestic crude oil output to a record in 2018, surpassing 10 million barrels per day (bpd), according to the U.S. Energy Department.  That would top the previous peak in the early 1970s and challenge Russia and Saudi Arabia for the title of top global producer.     Obstacle to 'Energy Independence'  To transport all that oil from central shale regions such as Texas and North Dakota to the East Coast, the U.S. relies largely on pipelines built decades ago. The industry has retooled many old oil arteries, and the resulting patchwork often offers a convoluted route.   It's a hodge-podge way of doing it,  said Tricia Curtis, oil analyst at Petronerds, a consultancy based in Denver.  U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke wants the nation to become the dominant global energy player, and is considering opening more federal lands - such as national parks and Native American reservations - to fossil fuel development. He also aims to lift restrictions on offshore drilling.  That's a new twist on achieving  energy independence,  an elusive, almost mythical goal that's been a standby of U.S. political dialogue over the half century since Richard Nixon was president.  Surging shale has reduced import dependence, but achieving anything approaching  independence  would require an overhaul of the nation's pipeline network - including construction of the kind of projects that face bleak prospects because of political opposition and geographic realities.  FILE PHOTO --  Pipes transport refined product to storage tanks at the Buckeye Partners' Laurel Pipeline terminal in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S. May 1, 2017.Jason Cohn/File PhotoAbout half of U.S. petroleum consumption is on the East and West Coasts, while the large expanse in the middle of the country accounts for 93 percent of crude output in the lower 48 states.  The challenges to building new pipelines are likely to keep the East and West Coast markets - where most Americans live - dependent on imported oil, said Doug Johnson, vice president at Tallgrass Energy Partners (TEP.N), which operates pipelines and storage facilities in the central and western United States.  The Rocky Mountains makes construction to much of the West Coast impossible, as does difficult topography and dense population on the East Coast.   Moving new pipelines through those areas is very, very challenging,  Johnson said.  Tallgrass's Pony Express line kicks off in Guernsey, Wyoming, a small town of 1,000 near the historic Oregon Trail Ruts. It's one small example of the industry's history of repurposing old lines. Originally built as a crude line in 1954, it was converted to a natural gas line in 1997, then changed back into a crude line in 2014.   This thing is like the cat with nine lives,  Johnson said.  An interior of a pumping station owned by Tallgrass Energy is pictured in Guernsey, Wyoming, U.S. on January 17, 2017.David GaffenNo Direct Line  Building pipelines from faraway oil fields such as the Bakken directly to the densely populated East Coast would be a boon to energy firms and consumers. But it won't happen, said Sandy Fielden, an analyst at Morningstar.   That flies in the face of NIMBY,  he said, referring to the 'not in my backyard' political resistance to construction.  Pipelines being built across New Jersey is not considered to be a practical proposition.   Resistance to new pipelines in the Northeast has led firms to battle for control of existing lines.  Midwest refiners are clashing with East Coast refiners over a proposal to reverse the flow of fuels on a Pennsylvania pipeline that transports refined products from east to west. Midwest refiners - who can access Dakota and Canada crudes, unlike their East Coast competitors - want that flow reversed to give them access to gasoline markets further east.  In at least one case, pipeline protesters are demanding the removal of an existing line. A 60-year-old Enbridge Line in Wisconsin and Michigan, an essential artery of oil from Canada, has come under fire from opponents of varying political stripes.  Environmentalists call the current pipeline network strong enough. They argue the country needs to look toward renewable energy sources rather than expanding climate-damaging oil-and-gas development.  Another environmental threat comes from an irony of the patchwork of U.S. pipelines - that the network is both over-subscribed and yet, in places, underused. Because many arteries travel similar routes, they duplicate one another and often can't operate at full capacity.  That raises the prospect of damaging leaks that go unnoticed by automated detection systems that require highly pressurized lines to function, said Anthony Swift, a director at the National Resources Defense Council.  One bright spot for firms that already own pipelines: It's far easier, politically and logistically, to expand a line than to build a new one - making existing lines increasingly valuable.  But in the long term, the U.S. will struggle to boost production without new pipelines that serve key consumer markets, said Tad True, president and CEO of Casper, Wyoming-based True Companies, a private pipeline owner.   One of the successes of this country was based on access to cheap energy,  he said.  The continued success of the United States depends on continued access to cheap energy.

The lawsuit was filed in the Cook County Circuit Court by the family of Grant Nelson, 34. Nelson was killed early on May 30 after picking up 16-year-old Eliza Wasni outside a Wal-Mart in Skokie, Illinois, around 16 miles (26 km) north of Chicago. Wasni, a high school student, was arrested shortly after the attack and charged in June with first-degree murder. She is being held without bail, the Chicago Tribune reported. The family is seeking unspecified financial damages. In addition to Wal-Mart, the lawsuit names Allied Universal and Monterrey Security Consultants as defendants, according to court documents. Both companies provided security services to the store. Wal-Mart said in a statement that it would respond  appropriately  with the court,  but we can say that we believe our associates acted properly, including alerting third-party security to a possible shoplifting incident.  Allied Universal and Monterrey Security Consultants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Privately held Uber Technologies Inc has grown from startup to a global ride service valued at $68 billion in less than a decade but has faced criticisms on issues ranging from corporate culture to driver payment. An attorney for Nelson's family, Robert Bingle, said in a statement that it was  very obvious that this young girl with a machete in one hand and a knife in the other hand, with no receipt, was not going to do anything good.  He said the tragedy could have been avoided  if Wal‐Mart and its agents had simply followed their own procedures.  He said Wasni was not stopped, questioned or asked to show a receipt at the store's exit door. After shoplifting the machete and knife, Wasni called an Uber and Nelson drove to pick her up, according to court documents. Two minutes into the ride, she attacked Nelson from behind, Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham said. Nelson was able to exit the car and made his way to a nearby condominium building where he yelled for help, the Chicago Tribune reported. Wasni fled in Nelson's car before crashing and fleeing on foot. She was then apprehended by police. The motive for the killing remains unknown.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-walmart-lawsuit-idUSL1N1JN1UK"},

The estates also agreed to withdraw roughly $99.5 million of claims against the bankruptcy estate of the former Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, the filing shows. Monday's settlement resolves some the highest-profile cases remaining in trustee Irving Picard's efforts to compensate former Madoff customers whom he estimates lost $17.5 billion. He has recovered $11.6 billion, or about two-thirds of that sum. The settlement also resolves claims against Mark Madoff's widow, Stephanie Mack, and some entities affiliated with the Madoff family. It also ends an investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, whose criminal probe resulted in a 150-year prison term for Bernard Madoff, a 10-year term for his brother Peter, and 13 other convictions and guilty pleas. Madoff's sons were never criminally charged and had maintained they knew nothing about their father's fraud until he confessed to them shortly before his Dec. 11, 2008, arrest.

In closing arguments at the end of a month-long trial in Manhattan federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Lockard told jurors that the non-profit Alavi Foundation, the building's majority owner, knew its minority partner, Assa Corp, was a front for Iran's government and helped hide that fact.  They knew that when that secret got out, they stood to lose everything,  he said. The government wants to seize the 36-story building at 650 Fifth Avenue, likely worth close to $1 billion, to benefit people with judgments against Iran relating to bombings and other attacks. John Gleeson, arguing for Alavi, did not dispute that Alavi knew Assa was owned by Iran's state-controlled Bank Melli when it entered into a partnership with it in 1989. But he said the foundation, established in the 1970s by the Shah of Iran to promote Persian and Islamic culture in the United States, was led to believe that Assa was sold before 1995, and was misled when it tried to learn more.  At every turn, it was either ignored, or given the run-around, or lied to,  Gleeson said. Lockard told jurors that Alavi continued to turn rental income from the building over to Assa after the United States imposed sanctions on Iran in 1995, violating those sanctions. He pointed to evidence including testimony from former Alavi board member Seyed Mojtaba Hesami-Kiche, a key government witness. He said a letter from another former board member to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei referred to the United States as  the Great Satan  and suggested Alavi was working for Iran. Lockard acknowledged that much of the evidence was from before 1995, but said Alavi personnel did not  forget  who controlled Assa when the sanctions took effect. Gleeson described Alavi as a legitimate non-profit raising money for charitable activities. He attacked the credibility of Hesami-Kiche, who was paid by the U.S. government and admitted on the stand that he initially failed to pay taxes on that money. Gleeson is expected to continue his arguments on Tuesday. The government will be allowed a brief response.

The New Zealand outfit had been highly secretive about their activities during the campaign to win the 35th America's Cup in Bermuda but opened up after clinching the  Auld Mug  on Monday.  After San Francisco, we had a pretty brutal debrief,  the team's CEO Grant Dalton told reporters after lifting the cup. That resulted in a 20-point plan focused on what the team, which is part government-funded alongside sponsorship from Emirates, Toyota and wealthy benefactors, had to do differently. Key among them was the need to  invest in technology on a pretty limited budget , an emotional Dalton, who is known by the rest of the team as  Dalts , revealed. The Kiwi team underwent a major shake-up and struggled for cash in the aftermath of the defeat at the hands of the better-funded team backed by Oracle founder Larry Ellison. Their own team principal and benefactor Matteo de Nora, who said on Monday he  knew we had an opportunity to do something  with Dalton, was instrumental in providing support and guidance during a period when others doubted.  They saw us as cowboys... we were to a point,  Dalton said, adding that there were times when the team had not been able to pay salaries but had managed to keep going. Thinking Outside the Boat Dalton and skipper Glenn Ashby, the only surviving member of the 2013 San Francisco 'shipwreck', worked together to come up with a plan that would be bold, different and revolutionary. That resulted in one significant secret weapon, which other teams have acknowledged changed the course of the cup.  We knew we couldn't outspend them (Oracle Team USA) so we had to out-think them,  Dalton said, adding that he and Ashby agreed from the start they would  throw the ball out as far as we can and see if we can get to it . It was Ashby, who Dalton calls  Glenny , who stuck to his guns on critical elements of the new program.  The foresight that we had as a team to be aggressive and bold in our design philosophy has ultimately provided us with the victory here today,  Ashby said. This included the decision to employ  cyclors , sailors who pedal to provide the hydraulic power needed to drive the boat, rather than traditional  grinders , who use their arms.  Glenn wouldn't let us employ any grinders,  Dalton said. New Zealand managed to keep the pedal set-up secret until late in the game, training at home and not showing their hand until February of this year when they revealed that Olympic cycling medalist Simon van Velthooven would be on board.  Another masterstroke was signing up Peter Burling to steer the team's 50-foot (15 meter) foiling catamaran. Dalton met secretly at his home with the 26-year-old, who has won Olympic gold and silver medals in the 49er skiff class. Burling, who has shown extraordinary calmness and composure during the America's Cup campaign and has been widely viewed as unflappable, said he wanted to helm the new New Zealand boat.   It was investing in the right people, giving them responsibility and not shackling them,  Dalton said. That philosophy paid off on Bermuda's Great Sound, and for de Nora, who did not reveal how much money he had plowed into the campaign, it was finally  mission accomplished .

Emirates Team New Zealand claimed international sport's oldest trophy with a stunning 7-1 victory in Bermuda's Great Sound, with 26-year-old Peter Burling becoming the youngest helmsman to secure sailing's biggest prize. In doing so, Burling usurped New Zealand's nemesis, Oracle Team USA skipper Jimmy Spithill, who won the cup in 2010 aged 30 and was hoping for a third successive victory. Larry Ellison, the billionaire Oracle founder, dressed in Oracle Team USA kit, came ashore from his boat to greet both teams after a fascinating battle of wills and technology. But the focus was on Olympic champion Burling, who showered his jubilant team mates and support crew with champagne after their sleek black, red and white catamaran crossed the line.  We're all ecstatic about what we have managed to achieve and we are on top of the world, it's going to be a good night,  Burling said after coolly steering his space-age 50-foot (15 meter) foiling catamaran to yet another win over Spithill.  They really were a class above in this America's Cup... They outsailed us and had a better boat... really well done,  Spithill said, later adding that there were many things his team would have done differently. Spithill, one of the world's most successful sailors, said it was too soon to say what he or the U.S. team would do next.

New Zealand won the right to take on the U.S. by beating four other  challengers  from Britain, France, Japan and Sweden, using cycling sailors dubbed  cyclors  to provide pedal power to control their catamaran's vast  wing  sail and hydrofoils. The Kiwis will now decide where, when and in what type of boat the next America's Cup will be held and there have been questions over whether they will opt for high-octane catamarans, or revert to the monohulls used in previous cups.

One certainty for the other teams thinking of the next campaign is that Italy's Luna Rossa, which is backed by the Italian luxury goods group Prada, has been chosen as the Challenger of Record for the 36th America's Cup. [L8N1JM0HZ]  The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron... has accepted a challenge from Circolo della Vela Sicilia,  Dalton said. The New Zealand crew had been on a mission to wipe out the hurt inflicted when an 8-1 lead was overhauled by the U.S. team. Slideshow (13 Images)New Zealand skipper Glenn Ashby, who has a low-key but critical role  trimming  the giant wing with a games console-type device, was the only member of the crew defeated in 2013 in this year's winning combination.  Relief to right the wrongs of the last campaign,  Ashby said when asked how he felt.  Yachting History Burling, who won Olympic gold last year in the 49er skiff class with fellow crew member Blair Tuke, has exuded a disarming calm and has now won a place in yachting history.  He has also brought a youthful confidence to New Zealand's rejuvenated campaign to regain the  Auld Mug , which Ashby called  this bloody trophy  in his victory speech. Many have put New Zealand's triumph down to the revolutionary  cycling  system developed to power the hydraulics needed to control the catamaran's foils, which lift it out of the water, and the vast  wing  sail which drives it along. Their  cyclors , including an Olympic cycling medalist, have kept their heads down throughout the contest, pedaling furiously to provide enough oil in the system to allow the boat to perform almost balletic pirouette maneuvers on the water. The sight of the boats skimming over the crystal clear waters of the natural sailing  arena  has drawn new audiences for sailing both in Bermuda and on television.  New Zealanders, in their uniform of black shirts and red socks, feted the victors with flags and cheers as Burling, Ashby and the team lifted the ornate silver trophy, which they later paraded triumphantly back to their base.

The brief submitted by 50 companies to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan marks the first time such a large group of businesses has backed arguments about employment discrimination that LGBT groups and the administration of former President Barack Obama have made for years. The companies said bias against gay employees is widespread, with more than 40 percent of gay workers reporting harassment and other forms of discrimination in various studies. The lack of a federal law clearly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has hindered recruitment in states that have not adopted their own, the companies said.  Recognizing that our uniform federal law protects LGBT employees would benefit individual businesses, and the economy as a whole, by removing an artificial barrier to the recruitment, retention, and free flow of talent,  wrote the companies' lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. The companies asked the 2nd Circuit to revive a lawsuit by the estate of Donald Zarda, who claimed he was fired from his job as a skydiving instructor on Long Island after he told a customer he was gay and she complained. Zarda died in a skydiving accident after filing the lawsuit. In April, a panel of three 2nd Circuit judges dismissed Zarda's case, saying the court's decision in a separate case in 2000 that said discrimination against gay workers is not a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 foreclosed his claims. But last month, the full court, which can overturn the prior ruling, agreed to review the case. That came weeks after a different appeals court in Chicago became the first to rule that Title VII protects gay workers. Zarda's former employer, Altitude Express Inc, says Congress did not intend for Title VII to apply to gay workers when it passed the law more than 50 years ago, and courts do not have the power to change the meaning of the law. A different appeals court in Atlanta, Georgia, is currently considering whether to revisit a March decision that dismissed a lawsuit by a former hospital security guard who said she was harassed and forced to quit because she is gay.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-lgbt-companies-idUSL1N1JN1TJ"},

The New Zealand outfit had been highly secretive about their activities during the campaign to win the 35th America's Cup in Bermuda but opened up after clinching the  Auld Mug  on Monday.  After San Francisco, we had a pretty brutal debrief,  the team's CEO Grant Dalton told reporters after lifting the cup. That resulted in a 20-point plan focused on what the team, which is part government-funded alongside sponsorship from Emirates, Toyota and wealthy benefactors, had to do differently. Key among them was the need to  invest in technology on a pretty limited budget , an emotional Dalton, who is known by the rest of the team as  Dalts , revealed. The Kiwi team underwent a major shake-up and struggled for cash in the aftermath of the defeat at the hands of the better-funded team backed by Oracle founder Larry Ellison. Their own team principal and benefactor Matteo de Nora, who said on Monday he  knew we had an opportunity to do something  with Dalton, was instrumental in providing support and guidance during a period when others doubted.  They saw us as cowboys... we were to a point,  Dalton said, adding that there were times when the team had not been able to pay salaries but had managed to keep going. Thinking Outside the Boat Dalton and skipper Glenn Ashby, the only surviving member of the 2013 San Francisco 'shipwreck', worked together to come up with a plan that would be bold, different and revolutionary. That resulted in one significant secret weapon, which other teams have acknowledged changed the course of the cup.  We knew we couldn't outspend them (Oracle Team USA) so we had to out-think them,  Dalton said, adding that he and Ashby agreed from the start they would  throw the ball out as far as we can and see if we can get to it . It was Ashby, who Dalton calls  Glenny , who stuck to his guns on critical elements of the new programme.  The foresight that we had as a team to be aggressive and bold in our design philosophy has ultimately provided us with the victory here today,  Ashby said. This included the decision to employ  cyclors , sailors who pedal to provide the hydraulic power needed to drive the boat, rather than traditional  grinders , who use their arms.  Glenn wouldn't let us employ any grinders,  Dalton said. New Zealand managed to keep the pedal set-up secret until late in the game, training at home and not showing their hand until February of this year when they revealed that Olympic cycling medallist Simon van Velthooven would be on board. Another masterstroke was signing up Peter Burling to steer the team's 50-foot (15 metre) foiling catamaran. Dalton met secretly at his home with the 26-year-old, who has won Olympic gold and silver medals in the 49er skiff class. Burling, who has shown extraordinary calmness and composure during the America's Cup campaign and has been widely viewed as unflappable, said he wanted to helm the new New Zealand boat.  It was investing in the right people, giving them responsibility and not shackling them,  Dalton said. That philosophy paid off on Bermuda's Great Sound, and for de Nora, who did not reveal how much money he had ploughed into the campaign, it was finally  mission accomplished .

People with a  bona fide relationship with a person or entity  in the United States are spared from the temporary ban affecting people from six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees that the justices on Monday allowed to go partially into effect.  There's no precedent for something like this that I'm aware of,  said Jeffrey Gorsky, a former legal adviser to the State Department's Visa Office, referring to the new  bona fide  standard. Gorsky said the standard is likely to sow confusion among U.S. consular officials who have to make visa decisions and could require another court decision to determine what constitutes a connection to the United States sufficient to allow entry. The Supreme Court agreed to decide the legality of Trump order in its next term, which begins in October. Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the court should have granted Trump's request to implement the travel ban in full while the legal fight continues.  Today's compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding - on peril of contempt - whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,  Thomas wrote, joined by two fellow conservative justices. In Monday's ruling, the high court gave a few examples of connections that qualify. For individuals, a close family relationship is required.  Bona fide connections to entities, it said, must be  formal  and  documented.  That would include students who have been admitted to a U.S. school and workers who have accepted an offer of employment from an American company, the court said. It noted that Trump's executive order already allowed for case-by-case waivers for people with connections to the country. On the other hand, the justices said, relationships created for the purposes of evading the travel ban will not be considered valid. For instance, an immigration agency cannot add foreigners to client lists  and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion.  The March 6 order called for a 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees to enable the government to implement stronger vetting procedures. Trump cited national security concerns as the reason for the order. Litigation Predicted Stephen Legomsky, chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under former President Barack Obama, said lawsuits could claim that a bona fide relationship was ignored.  While Legomsky said he believes the vast majority of cases will be clear cut, courts will have to determine whether visiting a close friend or taking part in a wedding could also qualify.  In theory, you could say if somebody is coming for tourism and has made a reservation for a hotel, there's now a U.S. interest in bringing them to the United States. The hotel is a U.S. entity,  Gorsky said.  Some lawyers also said the vagueness of the  bona fide  standard was license for the Trump administration to interpret it broadly.  It's just like a green light to the government to do what it wants to do,  said Kiyanoush Razaghi, a Maryland-based immigration attorney who deals with primarily Iranian clients.  Who is going to tell us what is the definition of 'bona fide relationship?'   The difficult job of judging foreigners' claimed connections could land back in the lower courts in Maryland and Hawaii that had originally blocked Trump's travel ban, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor University of Texas School of Law.    We could have dozens of these cases between now and September,  Vladeck said, adding that the Supreme Court would not be likely to weigh in on them on a case-by-case basis. David Martin, a former U.S. Department of Homeland Security official and now a professor at the University of Virginia, said the ruling was  carefully tailored  and should be manageable for officials to enact. Part of the reason, Martin said, is the case-by-case waiver process that was already envisioned in the executive order.  I think there will be some litigation over the extent of the reach of this bona fide relationship but I don't think it will be as burdensome as the dissenters suggest,  Martin said.

Blockchain technology provides an electronic record-keeping and transaction-processing system, which lets all parties track documentation through a secure network and requires no third-party verification.  This contrasts with the present process - trade finance transactions typically involve a complicated paper trail that requires international courier services, is vulnerable to document fraud, and can take as long as a month to be completed.  What we will have is a platform to bring buyers and sellers together and to make trade transactions very transparent from... the moment that a purchase order is issued up until payment,  said Hubert Bdenoot, general manager for trade finance at KBC, one of the banks in the consortium. A woman passes by the IBM offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016.Brendan McDermid The first service that will be available for buyers and sellers is financing and risk coverage, and it will also include a track-and-trade system so that buyers and sellers can follow the physical transfer of the goods,  he told Reuters.

Morgan at a huge initial interest rate of 6.41 percent, the cash-strapped district reported on Monday.   The rate on the grant anticipation notes is even higher than the 6.39 percent initial rate on $275 million of similar variable-rate notes CPS placed with the bank earlier this month. All of the notes mature on March 30, 2018.  By contrast, top-rated debt due next March was yielding just 0.92 percent on Municipal Market Data's short-term debt scale on Monday, indicating the junk-rated district is paying a big penalty due to its financial woes. The Chicago Board of Education approved the note sale last month as a way to avoid ending the current school year early and to help make a $721 million pension payment due to its teachers' retirement system on Friday, the end of the district's fiscal year. Escalating pension payments have led to drained reserves, debt dependency and junk bond ratings for the nation's third-largest public school system. The notes are backed by delayed grant funding owed the district by the state of Illinois, which is struggling through a second-straight fiscal year without a complete budget. As a result, the state has been forced to delay payments to vendors and others, ballooning its unpaid bill pile to about $15 billion. “Governor (Bruce) Rauner’s total failure to fully fund education in a timely way means that hundreds of districts around the state including Chicago are scrambling to make up for the state’s funding shortfall,” CPS spokeswoman Emily Bittner said in a statement. The Republican governor's veto of a bill giving CPS $215 million in one-time state money to help make its pension payment punched a hole in the district's $5.41 billion fiscal 2017 budget. The hole grew bigger with delayed state grants, totaling about $467 million to cover items such as transportation and special education.The initial rates on the notes will expire next week and will be reset monthly at 70 percent of the LIBOR rate plus 550 basis points.

The ruling by Judge Sergio Moro adds to the pressure on Palocci, who served as finance minister under former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, to reach a plea bargain with prosecutors in a bid to have his sentence reduced.  A deal is expected to be announced by September, when Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot finishes his term and is set to be replaced by an appointee of President Michel Temer. Palocci, who was chief of staff to Lula's successor, Dilma Rousseff, has offered to provide details about the kickback scheme under investigation that could hurt Lula's chances of running in the 2018 election. Plea bargain testimony from Palocci, once one of Brazil's most powerful politicians, could widen the scope of investigations currently focused on construction and engineering firms to include banks and other corporations.

Morgan at a huge initial interest rate of 6.41 percent, the cash-strapped district reported on Monday.   The rate on the grant anticipation notes is even higher than the 6.39 percent initial rate on $275 million of similar variable-rate notes CPS placed with the bank earlier this month. All of the notes mature on March 30, 2018.  By contrast, top-rated debt due next March was yielding just 0.92 percent on Municipal Market Data's short-term debt scale on Monday, indicating the junk-rated district is paying a big penalty due to its financial woes. The Chicago Board of Education approved the note sale last month as a way to avoid ending the current school year early and to help make a $721 million pension payment due to its teachers' retirement system on Friday, the end of the district's fiscal year. Escalating pension payments have led to drained reserves, debt dependency and junk bond ratings for the nation's third-largest public school system. The notes are backed by delayed grant funding owed the district by the state of Illinois, which is struggling through a second-straight fiscal year without a complete budget. As a result, the state has been forced to delay payments to vendors and others, ballooning its unpaid bill pile to about $15 billion. “Governor (Bruce) Rauner’s total failure to fully fund education in a timely way means that hundreds of districts around the state including Chicago are scrambling to make up for the state’s funding shortfall,” CPS spokeswoman Emily Bittner said in a statement. The Republican governor's veto of a bill giving CPS $215 million in one-time state money to help make its pension payment punched a hole in the district's $5.41 billion fiscal 2017 budget. The hole grew bigger with delayed state grants, totaling about $467 million to cover items such as transportation and special education.The initial rates on the notes will expire next week and will be reset monthly at 70 percent of the LIBOR rate plus 550 basis points.

Activists, human rights lawyers and journalists in Mexico filed a criminal complaint alleging their smartphones had been infected with spying software sold to the government to fight criminals and terrorists. Pena Nieto called the charges  false  and asked the attorney general's office to investigate.  We will ask the FBI for help,  said Ricardo Sanchez of Mexico's attorney general office, known locally as the PGR. The PGR will ask the alleged targets of the spying to hand over their phones for analysis, said Sanchez.  All those persons who have formally stated or through the press that their mobile phones have been hacked will be asked to hand in their phones to the investigation in order to carry out a forensic analysis,  said Sanchez. It will also request telecommunications companies to hand over the records of calls of the cellphones that have been allegedly infected by the spyware. Those records are kept on file for two years, according to Mexican law. Those claiming to be targeted by the software included Carmen Aristegui, a journalist who in 2014 helped reveal that President Enrique Pena Nieto's wife had acquired a house from a major government contractor, as well as Carlos Loret de Mola, a journalist at leading television network Televisa. Others included in the complaint were anti-corruption activists and lawyers representing the families of 43 trainee teachers who disappeared and were apparently massacred in 2014. The disappearance of the 43 and the government's handling of the investigation sparked international condemnation of law and order in Mexico, creating a major headache for Pena Nieto. Apart from concerns of government spying, Mexico was one of the most dangerous countries for journalists in 2016. At least six reporters have been killed this year. On Monday, authorities confirmed the death of Mexican journalist Salvador Adame, who was kidnapped last month in the violent western state of Michoacan.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-spyware-idUSL1N1JN1RU"},

Low-wage workers on average now clock 9 percent fewer hours and earn $125 less each month than before the Pacific Northwest city set one of the highest minimum wages in the nation, the University of Washington research paper said.  Even so, overall employment at city restaurants, where a large percentage of low-wage earners work, held steady. Seattle, which has a booming economy and a strong technology sector, is midway through an initiative to increase its minimum wage for all employers to $15 an hour. The city is at the forefront of a nationwide push by Democratic elected officials and organized labor in targeting $15 for all workers.  Most people will tell you there is a level of minimum wage that is too high,  Jacob Vigdor, a professor of public policy at the University of Washington and director of the team studying the increase, said in a phone interview.  There is a sense that as you raise it too high, then you get to a point where employers will really start cutting back.  Many companies reached that point after Seattle, a city of nearly 700,000 residents, raised the minimum to $13 an hour for large employers beginning Jan. 1, 2016, according to the study.  Seattle's labor market held steady when the minimum rose to $11 from $9.47 on April 1, 2015, the university found in a study released last year.   Raising the minimum wage helps ensure more people who live and work in Seattle can share in our city's success, and helps fight income inequality,  Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement in response to the study, which the city commissioned.  The federal minimum wage has stayed at $7.25 an hour since 2009, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress has opposed an increase. Critics of minimum wage increases say they lead to layoffs and force some companies out of business. The latest research from the University of Washington found no major reduction in hours or jobs at Seattle restaurants, in keeping with a finding in a study conducted by University of California, Berkeley, that was released last week.   Lawmakers in California, the nation's most populous state, voted last year to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022. Elected officials in several states, including New York and Oregon, and large cities such as Chicago have in the last two years approved their own minimum pay hikes.

Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs and Canadian college coach Clare Drake were named to the Builders category. Selanne takes his place in the Hall on his first year of eligibility.  The Finn announced his arrival in the National Hockey League with an explosive rookie campaign with the Winnipeg Jets scoring 76 goals which is still a record for first-year players. In a career that spanned 23 years, Selanne collected 684 goals to sit 11th on the NHL's all-time list and 15th in career points with 1,451.

George, a 27-year-old four-time All-Star, is a highly sought after target in the NBA this offseason and combining him with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving could produce a viable challenger to the dominant Warriors next season.  ESPN reported Monday on a possible three-way deal that would see the Cavs send forward Kevin Love to the Denver Nuggets, the Nuggets send several young players to the Pacers, and George forming a new Big Three in Cleveland with James and Irving.   This blockbuster trade from the Cavaliers standpoint is all determined by what the Golden State Warriors did in the NBA Finals,  ESPN pundit Chris Haynes said on Monday. Earlier this month the Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in five games to claim their second championship over Cleveland in three years.   The roster as structured right now, (the Cavs) don't feel like they have the talent and depth to contend with the Warriors,  he added.   The sticking point in the deal is that the Nuggets are not yet willing to part with either of their two best players - 20-year-old guard Jamal Murray and Serbian big man Nikola Jokić - but an agreement could still be reached, Haynes said. A team that would suffer if George went to Cleveland is the Los Angeles Lakers, who were hoping to nab George to serve as a leader in their locker room, which is budding with young talent.  George, who can become a free agent after next season, had previously expressed interest in returning to LA, where he is originally from, but may not be quick to change teams again if the Cavs move takes place and proves successful.  If the Cleveland Cavaliers win a title and dethrone the Warriors, Paul George really has to consider his initial basis of trying to get to LA,  Haynes said.   This is going to be a nightmare for the Lakers and could change the entire look of free agency next season.       Whether Cleveland is successful in bringing in George or not, the team will also pursue other big names around the Association this offseason including sharp-shooting forward Carmelo Anthony, who may be freed from his New York Knicks deal.

New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in manufacturing halfway through the second quarter.     The reports added to a recent batch of mixed economic figures that have left investors skeptical about the Fed's stated plan of raising U.S. rates once more before the end of 2017 and another three times next year. A slower pace of hikes could support demand for high-yielding emerging market assets.     Traders will look for further clues on the U.S. central bank's outlook on Tuesday, when Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to deliver a widely anticipated speech in Europe.     The Brazilian real strengthened 1.13 percent against the dollar, and the Mexican peso touched its strongest level since May 2016, closing up more than 0.8 percent.     Argentina's peso, meanwhile, closed at a new low of 16.30 per dollar due to a general realignment of portolios for hedging purposes before the end of the month.     Colombian markets were closed for a local holiday.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 1.8 percent, the biggest gainer among markets in the region, while Mexico's bourse climbed by 0.38 percent.     Shares of Brazilian steelmakers, such as Cia Siderúrgica Nacional SA and Usinas Siderúrgicas de Minas Gerais SA, led the upswing, tracking rising prices of steel and iron ore.     Alpargatas SA, which is not part of the benchmark index, rose 3.87 percent after its controlling shareholder J&F; Investimentos SA signed a nondisclosure agreement with Cambuhy Investimentos Ltda to potentially sell all of its shares.      Alpargatas is among the J&F; assets put up for sale as the holding company seeks funds to pay for a 10.3 billion real  ($3.11 billion) fine with Brazilian prosecutors. J&F;'s fine, the world's biggest to date, was imposed after members of the Batista family admitted to bribing scores of politicians.

People with a  bona fide relationship with a person or entity  in the United States are spared from the temporary ban affecting people from six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees that the justices on Monday allowed to go partially into effect.  There's no precedent for something like this that I'm aware of,  said Jeffrey Gorsky, a former legal adviser to the State Department's Visa Office, referring to the new  bona fide  standard. Gorsky said the standard is likely to sow confusion among U.S. consular officials who have to make visa decisions and could require another court decision to determine what constitutes a connection to the United States sufficient to allow entry. The Supreme Court agreed to decide the legality of Trump order in its next term, which begins in October. Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the court should have granted Trump's request to implement the travel ban in full while the legal fight continues.  Today's compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding - on peril of contempt - whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,  Thomas wrote, joined by two fellow conservative justices. In Monday's ruling, the high court gave a few examples of connections that qualify. For individuals, a close family relationship is required. Bona fide connections to entities, it said, must be  formal  and  documented.  That would include students who have been admitted to a U.S. school and workers who have accepted an offer of employment from an American company, the court said. It noted that Trump's executive order already allowed for case-by-case waivers for people with connections to the country. On the other hand, the justices said, relationships created for the purposes of evading the travel ban will not be considered valid. For instance, an immigration agency cannot add foreigners to client lists  and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion.  The March 6 order called for a 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees to enable the government to implement stronger vetting procedures. Trump cited national security concerns as the reason for the order. Litigation Predicted Stephen Legomsky, chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under former President Barack Obama, said lawsuits could claim that a bona fide relationship was ignored. While Legomsky said he believes the vast majority of cases will be clear cut, courts will have to determine whether visiting a close friend or taking part in a wedding could also qualify.  In theory, you could say if somebody is coming for tourism and has made a reservation for a hotel, there's now a U.S. interest in bringing them to the United States. The hotel is a U.S. entity,  Gorsky said. Some lawyers also said the vagueness of the  bona fide  standard was license for the Trump administration to interpret it broadly.  It's just like a green light to the government to do what it wants to do,  said Kiyanoush Razaghi, a Maryland-based immigration attorney who deals with primarily Iranian clients.  Who is going to tell us what is the definition of 'bona fide relationship?'  The difficult job of judging foreigners' claimed connections could land back in the lower courts in Maryland and Hawaii that had originally blocked Trump's travel ban, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor University of Texas School of Law.  We could have dozens of these cases between now and September,  Vladeck said, adding that the Supreme Court would not be likely to weigh in on them on a case-by-case basis. David Martin, a former U.S. Department of Homeland Security official and now a professor at the University of Virginia, said the ruling was  carefully tailored  and should be manageable for officials to enact. Part of the reason, Martin said, is the case-by-case waiver process that was already envisioned in the executive order.  I think there will be some litigation over the extent of the reach of this bona fide relationship but I don't think it will be as burdensome as the dissenters suggest,  Martin said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-immigration-legal-idUSL1N1JN1RM"},

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Colorado by the Department of Justice, Environmental Protection Agency and the state, seeks civil penalties and a court order barring the damaging release of so-called volatile organic compounds.  Violating emissions standards endangers public health and can give violators an unfair advantage in the marketplace,   Jeffrey Wood, acting assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, said in a written statement.   The United States will pursue all appropriate remedies against entities that violate our nation’s clean air laws,” Wood said. A spokeswoman for PDC Energy said in a statement that the company had been engaged for more than a year in  good-faith discussions  with state and federal agencies over emissions.  Prior to and throughout our negotiations, PDC Energy has worked diligently to address the concerns raised by the DOJ and EPA. That work is ongoing,  said the spokeswoman, Courtney Loper.  Though PDC Energy is disappointed with the filing, the company remains optimistic in its ability to resolve this dispute without protracted litigation.   According to the complaint, PDC has repeatedly violated clean air regulations intended to address the release of volatile organic compounds at 86 storage tanks it owns or operates in Colorado.

Trade finance was identified by a survey of banks carried out by IBM and the Economist Intelligence Unit last year as one of the top areas where blockchain - the underlying technology behind bitcoin - could have an impact. Blockchain technology provides an electronic record-keeping and transaction-processing system, which lets all parties track documentation through a secure network and requires no third-party verification.  This contrasts with the present process - trade finance transactions typically involve a complicated paper trail that requires international courier services, is vulnerable to document fraud, and can take as long as a month to be completed.  What we will have is a platform to bring buyers and sellers together and to make trade transactions very transparent from... the moment that a purchase order is issued up until payment,  said Hubert Bdenoot, general manager for trade finance at KBC, one of the banks in the consortium. A woman passes by the IBM offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016.Brendan McDermid The first service that will be available for buyers and sellers is financing and risk coverage, and it will also include a track-and-trade system so that buyers and sellers can follow the physical transfer of the goods,  he told Reuters. The  Digital Trade Chain Consortium , which also includes Societe Generale, Natixis, Rabobank and Unicredit, is aiming for the platform to be up-and-running and available for SMEs to use by the end of the year.       There are over 20 million SMEs in Europe, and they provide around 85 percent of the jobs as well, so it's a critical part of the economy and so anything that can facilitate growth in the SME community is going to help a lot,  said Keith Bear, vice president for financial markets and head of blockchain at IBM.   But KBC's Bdenoot said the new platform was unlikely to suddenly revolutionize the market.   I don't think this is going to be something that enters the market and then all of a sudden half of the SMEs are on the platform - I don't think that's realistic,  he said.  I think this is something that has to grow, but which will create a halo effect in the market.

Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns to sentence Barry Cadden, 50, the co-founder and former president of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center, to at least 35 years in prison. They said he had directed the production of drugs at the compounding pharmacy in unsanitary and dangerous ways in order to boost profits. Prosecutors said those shortcuts and Cadden's greed led to 778 people nationwide being harmed after receiving injections of contaminated steroids that Cadden's company produced. That includes 76 people who died, they said. Cadden was convicted in March of fraud and racketeering by a federal jury in Boston but cleared of the harshest charges he faced, second-degree murder. Cadden was one of 14 people tied to Framingham, Massachusetts-based compounding center indicted in 2014 following the outbreak. He was one of only two people to face second-degree murder charges. Prosecutors said Cadden, the compounding pharmacy's head pharmacist, ran the company as a criminal enterprise, selling substandard and non-sterile drugs to medical facilities nationwide. They said Cadden directed the shipment of 17,600 vials of contaminated steroids often prescribed for back pain despite knowing they were made in unsafe conditions, leading to the outbreak.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/massachusetts-meningitis-idUSL1N1JN1CH"},

Trump,Jesus Mesa,Neil Gorsuch,Sergio Hernandez,USA,COURT/BORDER,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out a lower court's ruling that barred a lawsuit against a U.S. Border Patrol agent for fatally shooting a 15-year-old Mexican from across the border in Texas. The justices, in an unsigned ruling, sent the case back to the lower court to reconsider whether the lawsuit brought by the parents of Sergio Hernandez can proceed against U.S. Border Patrol agent Jesus Mesa. The high court did not decide whether the U.S. Constitution's ban on unjustified deadly force applied to the slain teenager, a Mexican citizen on Mexican soil, when the shooting occurred in June 2010. The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Feb. 21 when it still had a vacancy and was divided with four conservative justices and four liberals. President Donald Trump's conservative appointee Neil Gorsuch joined the court in April and did not participate in the case.  The facts alleged in the complaint depict a disturbing incident resulting in a heartbreaking loss of life. Whether petitioners may recover damages for that loss in this suit depends on questions best answered by the court of appeals in the first instance,  the court said. The incident took place at a border crossing between El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The Border Patrol said at the time Hernandez was pelting U.S. agents with rocks from the Mexican side of the Rio Grande before the shooting. U.S. authorities have asserted that Mesa shot Hernandez in self-defense. Lawyers for Hernandez's family disputed that account, saying the teenager was playing a game with other teenagers in which they would run across a culvert from the Mexican side and touch the U.S. border fence before dashing back. The Supreme Court on Monday also ordered two other cases that touch upon immigrant rights to be argued for a second time in the fall so that Gorsuch can participate, likely breaking a tie vote. The first is on whether immigrants held in long-term detention during deportation proceedings can seek their release. . The second is on the scope of a federal law that requires immigrants to be deported when convicted of certain felony offenses.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-border-idUSL1N1JN1QQ"},

The brief submitted by 50 companies to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan marks the first time such a large group of businesses has backed arguments about employment discrimination that LGBT groups and the administration of former President Barack Obama have made for years. The companies said bias against gay employees is widespread, with more than 40 percent of gay workers reporting harassment and other forms of discrimination in various studies. The lack of a federal law clearly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has hindered recruitment in states that have not adopted their own, the companies said.   Recognizing that our uniform federal law protects LGBT employees would benefit individual businesses, and the economy as a whole, by removing an artificial barrier to the recruitment, retention, and free flow of talent,  wrote the companies' lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. The companies asked the 2nd Circuit to revive a lawsuit by the estate of Donald Zarda, who claimed he was fired from his job as a skydiving instructor on Long Island after he told a customer he was gay and she complained. Zarda died in a skydiving accident after filing the lawsuit. In April, a panel of three 2nd Circuit judges dismissed Zarda's case, saying the court's decision in a separate case in 2000 that said discrimination against gay workers is not a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 foreclosed his claims. But last month, the full court, which can overturn the prior ruling, agreed to review the case. That came weeks after a different appeals court in Chicago became the first to rule that Title VII protects gay workers.  Zarda's former employer, Altitude Express Inc, says Congress did not intend for Title VII to apply to gay workers when it passed the law more than 50 years ago, and courts do not have the power to change the meaning of the law. A different appeals court in Atlanta, Georgia, is currently considering whether to revisit a March decision that dismissed a lawsuit by a former hospital security guard who said she was harassed and forced to quit because she is gay.

But a Maryland prosecutor told jurors there was still enough evidence to find Tonya Lucas, 53, guilty of a crime that officials at the time called one of the worst in Baltimore's history. Lucas' case is among dozens in the United States in recent decades in which faulty arson investigation has led to reversed convictions and exonerations. She won a new trial last year after prosecutors admitted the arson science used to convict her on murder and arson charges had been discredited. Neither side gave details on the discredited arson evidence on Monday. During opening statements, prosecutors said Lucas was seen setting the fire in her home and wanted to cover up the abuse of her emaciated 2-year-old son, as well as to get other housing through the Red Cross. The night before the blaze, Lucas had told neighbors living in the basement how to escape from a fire, according to prosecutor Rita Wistoff-Ito.  These children, their lives were snuffed out 25 years ago by the actions of their mother. Their lives were stolen from them.  Lucas offered oral sex to a man in exchange for crack cocaine the morning of the fire, and he saw her setting lighter fluid alight in the building, Wistoff-Ito said. Six children ages 2 months to 12 years died, and a seventh child survived. As the prosecutor read out the names of her dead children, Lucas hung her head and dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief.  Michele Nethercott, Lucas' attorney, told jurors the original investigation of the blaze had been mishandled through a lack of documentation and analysis and now-debunked arson  science.  In the last 25 years, firefighters have learned a lot about how fire starts, how they develop and how they spread,  she said in her opening statement. Investigators' main mistake was trying to find out who had set the fire instead of probing how it started, Nethercott added. There have been 36 exonerations since 1991 in U.S. cases that included arson, at least partly because of false or misleading forensic evidence, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. Eleven of them have occurred since 2015, according to the registry, maintained by two Michigan law schools and the University of California-Irvine.

Trump,Mike Lee,Mike Pence,Mitch McConnell,Nancy Pelosi,Rand Paul,Richard Cowan,Ron Johnson,Sean Spicer,Shelley Moore Capito,Susan Collins,Ted Cruz,USA,HEALTHCARE/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twenty-two million Americans would lose insurance over the next decade under the healthcare bill drafted by U.S. Senate Republicans, a nonpartisan office said on Monday, an assessment that will likely make it more difficult for the already-fraught legislation to win support for speedy passage. The Congressional Budget Office's assessment complicates the task ahead for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who must find a way to reconcile the demands of moderate Republicans concerned about people losing their insurance and conservative senators who say the bill does not do enough to repeal Obamacare. Several moderates Republicans, including Susan Collins of Maine, have already said they could not support a bill that resulted in tens of millions of people losing their insurance. The CBO estimated that in 2026 49 million people would be uninsured under the Senate bill, compared with 28 million under the current law. It also estimated that the Senate bill would decrease the budget deficit by $321 billion over 2017-2026. The CBO score is likely to amplify criticism from industry groups such as the American Hospital Association and American Medical Association, which said earlier on Monday that the Senate's bill violated the doctors' precept of   first, do no harm.  President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress have been pushing to repeal and replace Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic legislation. Republican leaders want to hold a vote on the bill before the July 4 recess that starts at the end of this week. Republicans have only a 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate, so McConnell can lose just two Republican senators, relying on Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. No Democratic senators have said they would back the bill. Legislative Tweaks Earlier on Monday, Republicans released changes to their healthcare bill, adding a measure that would penalize people who let their insurance coverage lapse for an extended period, following criticism that the original bill would result in a sicker - and more expensive - insurance pool. The original Senate bill had dropped the Obamacare penalty on those who do not have insurance. Experts had warned that canceling the fine could lead to a sicker pool of people with insurance, because young and healthy people would not face consequences for failing to purchase insurance. The revised bill would impose a six-month waiting period for anyone who lets their health insurance lapse for over 63 days and then wants to re-enroll in a plan in the individual market. The version of a healthcare bill passed by the Republican-majority House of Representatives last month includes a provision also aimed at those who let their insurance lapse for more than 63 days, allowing insurers to charge a 30 percent penalty over their premium for one year. Under Senate rules, the bill must replicate savings projected in a House version of the legislation that passed last month. The CBO found that the Senate bill saved more than the House, clearing one critical hurdle. Democrats have assailed the Republican healthcare proposals, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer strongly criticized the new waiting-period provision, saying in a statement that tens of millions of Americans experience a gap in their healthcare coverage every year because of job losses or temporary financial problems. The provision  would pour salt in that wound, locking American families out of health insurance for even longer, thanks to this six-month ban provision,  Schumer said. The American Medical Association said it was especially concerned with a proposal to put the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor on a budget, saying this could  fail to take into account unanticipated costs of new medical innovations or the fiscal impact of public health epidemics, such as the crisis of opioid abuse currently ravaging our nation.  At least four conservative Republicans - Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee - have expressed opposition to the original draft legislation, saying it does not go far enough in repealing Obamacare. Moderate Republican Senator Dean Heller said on Saturday that he could not support the Senate bill as written, and some other moderates have either withheld judgment or expressed doubts about replacing Obamacare with legislation that is similar to the House version. They are concerned that the party's approach to healthcare would cause too many people, especially those with low incomes, to lose health coverage. The CBO estimated the House bill would cause 23 million people to lose insurance. Republicans have targeted Obamacare since it was passed in 2010, viewing it as costly government intrusion and saying that individual insurance markets are collapsing. The legislation expanded health coverage to some 20 million Americans, through provisions such as mandating that individuals obtain health insurance and expanding Medicaid. Trump's Involvement As he did during the House negotiations, Trump has personally pushed for a Senate bill, calling fellow Republicans to mobilize support. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Monday that Trump had talked over the weekend to Cruz, Paul and Johnson, as well as Senator Shelley Moore Capito,  and I think several others.  A spokesman for Paul said the senator and Trump had a  productive call  and that Paul was open to working with the president and Senate colleagues on improving the bill. America First Policies, a political group run by former Trump campaign staffers, said it would air healthcare-related attack ads against Heller, who faces a competitive re-election race next year.  Why did @SenDeanHeller lie to voters about #RepealAndReplace? He’s now with @NancyPelosi. NOT GOOD! #HellerVotesYes,  the group tweeted on Monday, referencing Representative Nancy Pelosi, the top House Democrat. Health insurance companies have expressed concern about the bill's plan to cut Medicaid and the impact on state governments as well as the prospect of losing Obamacare's mandate on individuals to buy insurance. Insurer Blue Cross and Blue Shield said in a statement on Monday that it was encouraged by the steps in the revised bill to make the individual insurance market more stable, including strong incentives for people to stay covered continuously. If the Senate passes a bill, it will either have to be approved by the House, the two chambers would have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee, or the House could pass a new version and bounce it back to the Senate.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index fell 3.54 points, or 0.02 percent, to 15,316.02. Trading volume was its lowest in three weeks.

Emirates Team New Zealand claimed international sport's oldest trophy with a stunning 7-1 victory in Bermuda's Great Sound, with 26-year-old Peter Burling becoming the youngest helmsman to secure sailing's biggest prize. In doing so, Burling usurped New Zealand's nemesis, Oracle Team USA skipper Jimmy Spithill, who won the cup in 2010 aged 30 and was hoping for a third successive victory. Larry Ellison, the billionaire Oracle founder, dressed in Oracle Team USA kit, came ashore from his boat to greet both teams after a fascinating battle of wills and technology. But the focus was on Olympic champion Burling, who showered his jubilant team mates and support crew with champagne after their sleek black, red and white catamaran crossed the line.  We're all ecstatic about what we have managed to achieve and we are on top of the world, it's going to be a good night,  Burling said after coolly steering his space-age 50-foot (15 meter) foiling catamaran to yet another win over Spithill.  They really were a class above in this America's Cup... They outsailed us and had a better boat... really well done,  Spithill said, later adding that there were many things his team would have done differently. Spithill, one of the world's most successful sailors, said it was too soon to say what he or the U.S. team would do next. Related CoverageMission accomplished: New Zealand plan brings America's Cup revengeItaly's Luna Rossa is Challenger of Record for 36th America's CupCycling Sailors The America's Cup, named after the schooner  America  which won it off the south coast of England in 1851, has only been held by teams from the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland.  New Zealand won the right to take on the U.S. by beating four other  challengers  from Britain, France, Japan and Sweden, using cycling sailors dubbed  cyclors  to provide pedal power to control their catamaran's vast  wing  sail and hydrofoils. The Kiwis will now decide where, when and in what type of boat the next America's Cup will be held and there have been questions over whether they will opt for high-octane catamarans, or revert to the monohulls used in previous cups.

One certainty for the other teams thinking of the next campaign is that Italy's Luna Rossa, which is backed by the Italian luxury goods group Prada, has been chosen as the Challenger of Record for the 36th America's Cup. [L8N1JM0HZ]  The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron... has accepted a challenge from Circolo della Vela Sicilia,  Dalton said. The New Zealand crew had been on a mission to wipe out the hurt inflicted when an 8-1 lead was overhauled by the U.S. team. Slideshow (13 Images)New Zealand skipper Glenn Ashby, who has a low-key but critical role  trimming  the giant wing with a games console-type device, was the only member of the crew defeated in 2013 in this year's winning combination.  Relief to right the wrongs of the last campaign,  Ashby said when asked how he felt.  Yachting History Burling, who won Olympic gold last year in the 49er skiff class with fellow crew member Blair Tuke, has exuded a disarming calm and has now won a place in yachting history.  He has also brought a youthful confidence to New Zealand's rejuvenated campaign to regain the  Auld Mug , which Ashby called  this bloody trophy  in his victory speech. Many have put New Zealand's triumph down to the revolutionary  cycling  system developed to power the hydraulics needed to control the catamaran's foils, which lift it out of the water, and the vast  wing  sail which drives it along. Their  cyclors , including an Olympic cycling medalist, have kept their heads down throughout the contest, pedaling furiously to provide enough oil in the system to allow the boat to perform almost balletic pirouette maneuvers on the water. The sight of the boats skimming over the crystal clear waters of the natural sailing  arena  has drawn new audiences for sailing both in Bermuda and on television.  New Zealanders, in their uniform of black shirts and red socks, feted the victors with flags and cheers as Burling, Ashby and the team lifted the ornate silver trophy, which they later paraded triumphantly back to their base.

Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. White House officials said on Friday that Trump has been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and made calls on Thursday and Friday to other lawmakers. Trump's role is expected to become more pronounced in coming days as the vote nears. Senate Republican leaders may rely on the deal-making former businessman to lean on conservative senators who are balking at the bill.  We're pleasantly surprised with a lot of the support that's already come out and I think we'll continue to work through (it,) in particular the four individuals who have expressed some ideas and concerns,  White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing. With all Democrats expected to oppose the measure, the Republicans can afford to lose the support of only two of their 52 members if they want to pass the legislation. After Spicer spoke, Republican Senator Dean Heller became the fifth Republican opponent on Friday, saying he would not support the bill in its current form.  This bill that's currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer,  Heller, a moderate who is up for re-election in 2018, said at a news conference in Las Vegas. That could add Heller's name to Trump's call list. A White House official said the Trump has pushed his team to stay involved and plans to flex his negotiating muscle, the official said. An outside political group aligned with the White House, America First Policies, said it is planning an advertising campaign targeting Heller for his opposition to the bill. Healthcare stocks closed down 0.1 percent on Friday, clawing back some losses after the sector dropped sharply late in the session on Heller's announcement. The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central Trump campaign promise to undo former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. Four Conservatives Oppose Bill On Thursday, four of the Senate's most conservative members said the new plan failed to rein in the federal government's role. Rand Paul, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, said fundamental problems remained that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies. Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday morning, called the group of conservative lawmakers  four very good people.   It's not that they're opposed,  he said.  They'd like to get certain changes. And we'll see if we can take care of that.  Trump said getting approval would require traveling a  very, very narrow path  but that  I think we're going to get there.   It's going to be a good bill,  Trump said in a separate Fox News interview to air on Sunday. For the House of Representatives' version of healthcare, Trump held regular meetings with representatives at the White House. He celebrated the bill's narrow passage last month in a Rose Garden event with House Republican leaders. Trump later criticized the House bill privately as  mean  and this week called for a health plan  with heart.  He indicated the Senate plan met that request. McConnell said in an interview with Reuters last month that he told Trump early on in the process that he did not need his help but that there may be a role for him later. The Senate bill maintains much of the structure of the House's but differs in key ways. It would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It also would provide more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-idUSL1N1JN1NQ"},

Patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 who have progressed to the need for insulin typically check blood sugar levels several times a day and inject insulin as needed. The pumps eliminate that chore. Medtronic declined to discuss financial details of the Aetna agreement, but said such deals tie revenue to achievement of clinical improvement targets, as well as shared savings for delivering on or exceeding clinical outcomes and cost targets. Suzanne Winter, vice president of the Medtronic diabetes group in the Americas, said the Aetna agreement will initially focus on whether patients on its pumps achieve their A1c targets, a commonly used measure of blood sugar levels. The American Diabetes Association recommends A1c levels below 7. In the future it may look at other measures, such as hypoglycemia episodes, time in proper glycemic range, and patient satisfaction, Winter said. Medtronic already has an agreement with UnitedHealth Group Inc that is moving toward including patient outcomes and other metrics, such as total cost of care, and the company is discussing similar deals with other insurers, Winter said. Pharmaceutical companies are also beginning to embrace reimbursement options that take patient outcomes into consideration. U.S. biotech Amgen Inc, in an effort to improve patient access to its expensive new cholesterol drug Repatha, has offered contract options that include refunding the cost of the drug if patients suffer a heart attack or stroke while on the medicine intended to prevent them.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-aetna-diabetes-idUSL1N1JN1NI"},

Trump,Mitch McConnell,Rand Paul,Ron Johnson,Susan Collins,USA,HEALTHCARE/COLLINS,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said on Sunday she has extreme reservations about the U.S. Senate's healthcare overhaul and does not think it will be able to pass this week. Collins, a moderate Republican who has not taken a formal stance on the bill, said she was concerned it would cut Medicaid too deeply and said she wants to see an upcoming analysis by the Congressional Budget Office before making a decision.  I have very serious concerns about the bill,  she said on ABC's  This Week  program.  It's hard for me to see the bill passing this week.  Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pushed for a vote before the July 4th Independence Day holiday recess that begins at the end of this week. He can afford to lose the support of only two Republicans in the face of unanimous Democratic opposition. Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. One of those senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, called on Sunday for a slowdown in the process to give the Senate and the public time to evaluate the healthcare bill.  We don't have enough information. I don't have the feedback from constituencies who will not have had enough time to view the Senate bill. We should not be voting on this next week,  he said on NBC's  Meet the Press.  Another senator who has announced that he does not support the current version of the bill, Rand Paul of Kentucky, said he would back it if the Senate reached an impasse on healthcare.  If we get to impasse, if we go to a bill that is more repeal and less big government programs, yes I’ll consider partial repeal,  Paul said on ABC. The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to undo former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing.  I think they have, at best, a 50-50 chance of passing this bill,  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on ABC. He said Democrats  are doing everything we can to fight this bill because it's so devastating for the middle class.  The House of Representatives has passed a measure similar to the Senate plan. The Senate would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House bill, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-collins-idUSL1N1JN1NF"},

The ANFFA union renewed its longstanding criticism about budget cuts and understaffing after the United States blocked Brazilian fresh beef shipments late last week, saying it found abscesses in the meat and signs of systemic failure of inspections. The ban, twinned with the disclosure that the European Union had found E.coli and salmonella in meat and chicken exported from Brazil, was the latest black eye for a key sector of the country's sprawling farm economy.  ANFFA President Mauricio Porto said in an interview that the country's inspector staffing had slid to 2,600 from 3,200 in 2002, even as the number of meatpacking plants more than doubled. While it is not atypical for government unions to grouse about budget cuts that thin their own ranks, the inspectors' criticism has taken on an added resonance given the export woes, which come on top of a meat oversight bribery scandal that rocked the sector in March.  This could get worse, because more than half of current inspectors have enough working time to retire, and they are likely to do it to be able to get better retirement terms before the new pension code is approved,  Porto said, referring to a proposed pension reform that is a central goal of President Michel Temer's administration. The Agriculture Ministry was aware of the criticism by the union, a spokeswoman said, but did not have any immediate additional comment.  Brazil’s government in March announced a 45 percent cut in the Agriculture Ministry’s budget, part of a plan to reduce spending as it fights a fiscal deficit that reached record levels in the last two years. Brazilian Deputy Agriculture Minister Eumar Novacki on Friday said the abscesses U.S. inspectors found in the Brazilian meat did not represent a public health risk, adding that some cattle had experienced adverse reactions to vaccines to prevent foot-and-mouth disease. A butcher cuts meat at a shop in Sao Paulo, Brazil June 26, 2017.Paulo WhitakerHe acknowledged there were flaws in Brazil's inspection system but said there could also be  commercial motivations  for the import ban. The Agricultural Ministry's linkage of the abscesses to vaccines was questioned by some experts. Vaccines for foot-and-mouth disease are the No. 1 vaccines used in animals worldwide, said James Roth, director of the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University. In Brazil, drug companies including Merck & Co and Bayer Animal Health are approved to sell vaccines for the disease, according to the center. Slideshow (3 Images)Roth said “any injection into an animal might rarely produce an abscess” if the needle is dirty. However,  if abscesses are showing up in the meat, there has to be a failure in the slaughter plant because those should be caught and removed,” he said. The USDA had no immediate comment on whether foot-and-mouth vaccines or budget cuts have contributed to problems with Brazil’s fresh beef. The U.S. ban on Brazilian meat came three months after a broader crisis caused by a police investigation into alleged bribery of health officials by meatpackers including JBS SA, the world's largest protein processor. The union said the understaffing situation was also contributing to corruption since it is harder to bribe employees who work in tandem. While only the United States put in place an outright ban on fresh beef from Brazil, officials in Canada and the EU said on Friday they had rejected some shipments of Brazilian beef in recent months. The EU cited issues with Shiga toxin-producing E.coli in beef as well as salmonella in poultry.

Oil prices climbed off last week's seven-month lows, but gains were capped by a relentless rise in U.S. supply and bloated global inventories. U.S. crude        prices rose 0.8 percent to $43.38 a barrel.          Amo Sahota, director at Klarity FX in San Francisco, said the heavy summer driving season should help with the inventory glut.      If they don't, I think this market is in some real trouble for oil and that's just going to keep weighing on the loonie,  said Sahota.  That's going to act as a counter to what the rhetoric has been from the Bank of Canada.      Earlier this month, the central bank shifted to a more hawkish stance when its top two officials said rate cuts put in place in 2015 had largely done their work.                  At 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3247 to the greenback, or 75.49 U.S. cents, up 0.2 percent.     The currency traded between C$1.3213 and C$1.3277.     The greenback        weakened initially after an unexpected fall in new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods suggested a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter.                 The U.S. dollar rebounded after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi defended the ECB's monetary policy.                  Sahota said the market would look to Canada's monthly economic growth data on Friday for further direction, and would also watch closely for monetary policy clarity in upcoming central bank speeches.     Governor Stephen Poloz will speak in Portugal on Wednesday. The Bank will also release its business outlook report on Friday.     Speculators cut bearish bets on the Canadian dollar for a fourth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday. Canadian dollar net short positions fell to 82,881 contracts as of June 20 from 88,595 a week earlier.                  Data on Friday showing weaker-than-expected domestic inflation has reduced the chances of an interest rate hike next month from the Bank of Canada. But analysts expect policymakers to stay hawkish amid concern that rates have been low for too long.                                                Canadian government bond prices were mixed across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year            was down 1 Canadian cent to yield 0.903 percent and the 10-year             rose 12 Canadian cents to yield 1.463 percent.

Trump,Jeff Flake,Mark Meadows,McConnell,Ted Cruz,Tim Phillips,USA,HEALTHCARE/KOCH,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - Officials with the conservative U.S. political network overseen by the Koch brothers say they are unhappy with the healthcare bill that may be voted on by the Senate this week and will lobby for changes to it. At a weekend event with conservative donors, top aides to Charles Koch, the billionaire energy magnate, said the Senate bill does not go far enough to dismantle former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, also known as Obamacare. “We have been disappointed that movement has not been more dramatic toward a full repeal,” said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a grassroots advocacy group backed by Charles Koch and his brother, David. The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by Senate Majority Leader McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to repeal Obamacare, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since its passage in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. Phillips and other aides to the Koch network told Reuters they want to see the Senate bill do more to roll back Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for poor and disabled Americans. They also contend the bill does not do enough to reform the U.S. healthcare system and cut costs. The aides said lobbying efforts to reshape the bill are continuing ahead of a planned vote. Similar concerns helped steer the House’s version of the bill in a more conservative direction. A primary mover of that effort, Mark Meadows, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, attended the Koch donor event. Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus in the House, said he is prepared to support the Senate bill if it clears that chamber, a sign that quick action to land the legislation on Trump’s desk is possible. However, Meadows said the Senate version of the bill would need to be amended to allow insurers who sell plans on Obamacare’s insurance exchanges to offer less-expensive plans that do not comply with that law’s coverage requirements. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who currently opposes the Senate bill, has offered an amendment along those lines. Cruz attended the Koch event here, as did Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who remain undecided. Meadows also seeks an amendment that would allow some consumers who have private health savings accounts to deduct the cost of insurance premiums from their taxes. Senate leaders have set a goal of passing the healthcare measure by the end of this week, ahead of the July 4 congressional recess, which would then send it back to the House. If the Senate passes legislation this week that is palatable to the House, Meadows said it is conceivable the House could pass that version and choose to forgo a formal conference committee that would reconcile the Senate and House bills. That, he said, could result in sending the bill to Trump’s desk for his signature before the recess. Getting a vote by the end of the week could be difficult.

The justices, in an unsigned ruling, sent the case back to the lower court to reconsider whether the lawsuit brought by the parents of Sergio Hernandez can proceed against U.S. Border Patrol agent Jesus Mesa. The high court did not decide whether the U.S. Constitution's ban on unjustified deadly force applied to the slain teenager, a Mexican citizen on Mexican soil, when the shooting occurred in June 2010. The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Feb. 21 when it still had a vacancy and was divided with four conservative justices and four liberals. President Donald Trump's conservative appointee Neil Gorsuch joined the court in April and did not participate in the case.  The facts alleged in the complaint depict a disturbing incident resulting in a heartbreaking loss of life. Whether petitioners may recover damages for that loss in this suit depends on questions best answered by the court of appeals in the first instance,  the court said. The incident took place at a border crossing between El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The Border Patrol said at the time Hernandez was pelting U.S. agents with rocks from the Mexican side of the Rio Grande before the shooting. U.S. authorities have asserted that Mesa shot Hernandez in self-defense. Lawyers for Hernandez's family disputed that account, saying the teenager was playing a game with other teenagers in which they would run across a culvert from the Mexican side and touch the U.S. border fence before dashing back. The Supreme Court on Monday also ordered two other cases that touch upon immigrant rights to be argued for a second time in the fall so that Gorsuch can participate, likely breaking a tie vote. The first is on whether immigrants held in long-term detention during deportation proceedings can seek their release.. The second is on the scope of a federal law that requires immigrants to be deported when convicted of certain felony offenses.

The finding comes from the first rigorous study examining the impact of whole genome sequencing in healthy primary care patients.  Scientists for years have predicted that a person's DNA would eventually become part of every patient's medical chart.   The new study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, put that notion to the test. It studied the value of whole genome sequencing in a group of 100 healthy patients and their doctors. Half of these patients were offered to have their genetic code analyzed to see whether they were carrying any mutations linked with disease. Doctors also took a detailed family history of these patients. The other half were simply offered a family history assessment. Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, along with collaborators at Baylor College of Medicine, analyzed nearly 5,000 genes associated with rare genetic conditions in each of the patients offered sequencing. Researchers found that among those 50 healthy individuals, 11 patients, or 22 percent, carried mutations liked with rare disease. Of these 11, only two had signs of underlying conditions. In the other nine, there was no sign of the genetic disease they were predicted to have. Dr Jason Vassy of the Brigham, who led the study, said the findings show that sequencing healthy people will inevitably turn up new information, but only some of it will actually be useful in improving their health.  Although the research did show that primary care doctors were capable of handling the massive amount of genetic information contained in the tests, it also showed that more study is needed before routine genome sequencing in healthy people is  medically justified,  Vassy said in a statement. Heidi Rehm, director of the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at the Brigham, said the researchers were surprised at how many healthy people carried risk variants for rare genetic diseases. That suggests that risk of rare disease could be  far higher than previously suspected,  she said in a statement. What is not clear is how likely it is that people who have those risk genes actually develop disease, Rehm said.

Based on findings from a variety of large studies, Americans without health insurance faced 40 percent higher odds of dying during the study periods than the privately insured, the report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found. “Being uninsured is deadly,” co-author Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, a Hunter College health policy professor, said in a phone interview. “That was the conclusion from a 2002 Institute of Medicine report. The evidence that’s accumulated over the last 15 years actually strengthens the Institute of Medicine’s conclusions.” Since the institute, an independent panel of experts, issued its 2002 report, new studies have examined the impact of health insurance on mortality. Woolhandler and Himmelstein reviewed the more recent research and found that having private insurance, when compared to being uninsured, reduced the odds that Americans would die during the studies by as much as 29 percent, Woolhandler said in a phone interview. But Bernard Black, another researcher who’s looked at the issue, questioned the methodology used in most other studies and attacked the new report’s conclusions as “completely invalid.” Almost all the studies compared uninsured to privately insured Americans and excluded people with public insurance.  “It’s not a proper research design,” Black, a professor at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law in Chicago, said in a phone interview. “The core mistake – let’s take the sick people out of the equation.” Woolhandler called Baker’s view “clearly an outlier.” Most of the researchers removed publicly insured Americans from their analyses because people frequently go on public insurance when they become disabled, and therefore, including the publicly insured would muddy the results and fail to clarify whether having insurance kept people alive, she said.  Consequently, researchers generally have compared uninsured people to privately insured people while trying to control for variables that might impact mortality, such as poverty and health status, she said. It would be unethical to study the question by randomly insuring some Americans and not others. But a lottery for insurance in Oregon did create something akin to the gold standard of a randomized controlled trial.  In 2008, the state held a lottery and allowed poor, healthy, uninsured adults to sign up for Medicaid. For every 10,000 people who enrolled in the health insurance program, 13 lives were saved, the study found.  The results were not statistically significant, although Woolhandler said she believes that was because the study had too few subjects. But, she said, “If you save 13 lives for every 10,000 people you insure, for me, as a doctor, that’s really meaningful.” On Monday, the American Medical Association registered its opposition to the proposed Republican Senate healthcare bill. If enacted, the physicians’ group said the legislation would make it harder for low- and middle-income Americans to afford healthcare and would violate the precept of “first, do no harm.” (bit.ly/2tN3udt) While most researchers believe loss of coverage would result in more deaths, the question of mortality benefits from insurance remains unresolved for Black. “It’s not like I’m saying there is no effect,” he said. “I’m saying we don’t know, and let’s go look.” The question of mortality is not the only question facing members of Congress as they consider reforming healthcare, said Dr. Matthew Davis, a professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “Even before this study, members of Congress – and the American public who elected them – already have a strong personal sense of the value of health insurance,” he said in an email. “I have had uninsured patients who were grateful they survived a health problem even though they did not have coverage, but I have never had a patient who told me that the reason they survived is that they were uninsured,” he said.  The Senate's healthcare proposal aims to undo former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since 2010.  The bill would repeal the 3.8 percent net investment income tax on high earners and would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.

Key Points: The case is a major test of presidential powers. The justices granted parts of the Trump administration's emergency request to put the order into effect immediately while the legal battle continues. The court, which narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had blocked his March 6 executive order, said it would hear arguments in October on the lawfulness of the ban. Comments THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS, A MUSLIM CIVIL RIGHTS AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION The council expressed its concerns about the Supreme Court decision in relations to Islam saying it  ignores the Islamophobic origins of the policy and emboldens Islamophobes in the Trump administration.  AHMED AL-NASI, OFFICIAL AT YEMEN MINISTRY OF EXPATRIATE AFFAIRS Al-Nasi, whose country is one of the six falling under the ban, also criticized the Supreme Court decision.   We believe it will not help in confronting terrorism and extremism, but rather will increase the feeling among the nationals of these countries that they are all being targeted,  he said.  Especially given that Yemen is an active partner of the United States in the war on terrorism and that there are joint operations against terrorist elements in Yemen.  Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire Shaheen expressed disappointment in the court's decision.  Muslim travel ban has no merit & offensive to our nation’s core values,  she said on Twitter.  TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT OF JUDICIAL WATCH, A CONSERVATIVE FOUNDATION  Fitton praised the Supreme Court's decision.  This is a major blow to anti-Trump activist judges on the lower courts. And it is a big victory for our nation’s security, President Trump, and the rule of the law.  he said in a statement.  DAVID MILIBAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE HUMANITARIAN AGENCY AND A FORMER BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER Miliband said the ruling could hurt refugees who have already been vetted and were slated to come to the United States.      “The court’s decision threatens damage to vulnerable people waiting to come to the U.S.: people with urgent medical conditions blocked, innocent people left adrift, all of whom have been extensively vetted,” he said in a statement. “We urge the administration to begin its long-delayed review of the vetting process and restart a program which changes lives for the better.” MICHAEL O'ROURKE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT JONESTRADING IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT O'Rourke said it was not clear if the news on the travel ban was having an impact on stocks.   I think it's having a little impact, but I'm not sure. It just seemed to be the timing of the headlines.   There are a couple of different things floating around. ... I feel there's a combination of a bunch of little things.    And I have a thematic track basket for immigration, and there are a bunch of tech names in there. Maybe people are reading into the immigration story there. ... But we know what policy the president is going to pursue. It's not lining up perfectly for me.  ERIC SCHWARTZ, PRESIDENT OF REFUGEES INTERNATIONAL AND FORMER U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POPULATION, REFUGEES, AND MIGRATION Schwartz said he was disappointed by the court's decision. “The suspension of refugee resettlement will impact the most vulnerable of the world’s populations, including refugee women and girls, survivors of violence and torture, and refugee children, among many other groups at considerable risk.  he said.  The options for organizations like ours are now limited as the Supreme Court reviews this case.” BECCA HELLER, DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE ASSISTANCE PROJECT Heller said the parts of the travel ban allowed to go into effect “are actually incredibly narrow.” “Almost anyone coming into the U.S. who has a visa or has been in the refugee program for a while ... has some kind of tie to a U.S. person or a U.S. entity,” she said. “The hope is that this really only impacts a very small number of people.  President Trump Trump praised the court's decision in a statement released by the White House.  Today's unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security,  he said.  Today's ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our nation's homeland.  DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ED MARKEY OF MASSACHUSETTS, MEMBER OF THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE Markey said in an interview with CNN that the top court made it clear the Trump administration had overreached when it came to businesses, family members and students but expressed concern that the court did not issue a more fundamental ruling.            I'm disappointed that the court just didn't rule that a Muslim ban in and of itself is unconstitutional,  Markey said. OMAR JADWAT, DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION'S IMMIGRANTS' RIGHTS PROJECT Jadwat, who argued the appellate case on the executive order, said in a statement:  President Trump’s Muslim ban violates the fundamental constitutional principle that government cannot favor or disfavor any one religion. Courts have repeatedly blocked this indefensible and discriminatory ban. The Supreme Court now has a chance to permanently strike it down.” WILLIAM STOCK, OUTGOING PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN IMMIGRATION LAWYERS ASSOCIATION  Stock said the  bona fide connections  to the United States cited by the court as a requirement for admission to the country might include those on employer-sponsored visas, family-sponsored green card applications, people who are admitted by schools in the United States as students and those collaborating on research with people in the United States.   The court seems to be saying if a family in Iran had prepaid for Disneyland, they probably have a demonstrable connection to the United States that might allow for issuance of a visitor visa,” Stock said. “If a person says ‘I’ve heard of Disneyland and I’d really like to see it,’ that probably doesn’t get them in.” Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez In a statement, Perez vowed to keep fighting the ban, which he called unconstitutional and an assault on American religious freedom.    As a nation, our diversity is our greatest strength, and we cannot allow such prejudice to shut the doors of progress. Democrats will continue to fight this hatred every step of the way,” Perez said.   Republican Senator Luther Strange of Alabama  Great news for our national security, the rule of law and @POTUS,  Strange said on Twitter, referring to Trump.

Flávio Augusto da Silva, who created Wiser last month after fellow billionaire Carlos Wizard Martins agreed to buy a stake in his Wise Up chain, told Reuters that the company is eyeing targets in regions outside Brazil's southwest region.  Wiser expects to have 1,000 schools across Brazil by the end of 2020, from about 450 now. In May, Wizard's family spent 200 million reais ($61 million) for a 35 percent stake in Wiser, which groups the WiseUp, YouMove and Number One English language school brands.  Last week, Wiser bought all of Number One for an undisclosed sum, adding about 135 schools and 100 million reais ($30 million) in annual revenue. With an estimated economic value of 750 million reais after the Number One purchase, Wiser's valuation could double in a couple of years  with the right acquisitions and the right business focus,  Silva said in an interview at the weekend.  Robust income gains and social mobility allowed millions of Brazilians to enter English courses at the start of the decade, luring global investors into the sector. About 5 percent of Brazil's population of 200 million speak a second language, giving bilingual workers the ability to negotiate salaries 40 percent to 60 percent higher, industry estimates show. Wizard sold his English language school Grupo Multi SA to Britain's Pearson Plc (PSON.L) for 2 billion reais in 2013. Silva, meanwhile, bought back Wise Up from Somos Educação SA about a year ago, paying about 60 percent less for the chain than the 1 billion reais at which he sold it in 2013.  Since the repurchase, Silva undertook a drastic turnaround of WiseUp, focusing on ending years of high delinquencies on student loans and soaring operational costs. Acquisitions could go beyond language schools although remain restricted to Brazil's education industry, he added. Wiser has most of its schools located in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte - Brazil's most populous cities - as well as the wealthy national capital, Brasilia, and the southern city of Curitiba. Silva, who owns the Orlando City Soccer Club in the U.S. Major League Soccer, declined to elaborate on potential targets.

Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, along with collaborators at Baylor College of Medicine, analyzed nearly 5,000 genes associated with rare genetic conditions in each of the patients offered sequencing. Researchers found that among those 50 healthy individuals, 11 patients, or 22 percent, carried mutations liked with rare disease. Of these 11, only two had signs of underlying conditions. In the other nine, there was no sign of the genetic disease they were predicted to have. Dr Jason Vassy of the Brigham, who led the study, said the findings show that sequencing healthy people will inevitably turn up new information, but only some of it will actually be useful in improving their health.  Although the research did show that primary care doctors were capable of handling the massive amount of genetic information contained in the tests, it also showed that more study is needed before routine genome sequencing in healthy people is  medically justified,  Vassy said in a statement. Heidi Rehm, director of the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at the Brigham, said the researchers were surprised at how many healthy people carried risk variants for rare genetic diseases. That suggests that risk of rare disease could be  far higher than previously suspected,  she said in a statement. What is not clear is how likely it is that people who have those risk genes actually develop disease, Rehm said.

The ANFFA union renewed its longstanding criticism about budget cuts and understaffing after the United States blocked Brazilian fresh beef shipments late last week, saying it found abscesses in the meat and signs of systemic failure of inspections. The ban, twinned with the disclosure that the European Union had found E.coli and salmonella in meat and chicken exported from Brazil, was the latest black eye for a key sector of the country's sprawling farm economy.  ANFFA President Mauricio Porto said in an interview that the country's inspector staffing had slid to 2,600 from 3,200 in 2002, even as the number of meatpacking plants more than doubled. While it is not atypical for government unions to grouse about budget cuts that thin their own ranks, the inspectors' criticism has taken on an added resonance given the export woes, which come on top of a meat oversight bribery scandal that rocked the sector in March.  This could get worse, because more than half of current inspectors have enough working time to retire, and they are likely to do it to be able to get better retirement terms before the new pension code is approved,  Porto said, referring to a proposed pension reform that is a central goal of President Michel Temer's administration. The Agriculture Ministry was aware of the criticism by the union, a spokeswoman said, but did not have any immediate additional comment.  Brazil’s government in March announced a 45 percent cut in the Agriculture Ministry’s budget, part of a plan to reduce spending as it fights a fiscal deficit that reached record levels in the last two years. Brazilian Deputy Agriculture Minister Eumar Novacki on Friday said the abscesses U.S. inspectors found in the Brazilian meat did not represent a public health risk, adding that some cattle had experienced adverse reactions to vaccines to prevent foot-and-mouth disease. A butcher cuts meat at a shop in Sao Paulo, Brazil June 26, 2017.Paulo WhitakerHe acknowledged there were flaws in Brazil's inspection system but said there could also be  commercial motivations  for the import ban. The Agricultural Ministry's linkage of the abscesses to vaccines was questioned by some experts. Vaccines for foot-and-mouth disease are the No. 1 vaccines used in animals worldwide, said James Roth, director of the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University. In Brazil, drug companies including Merck & Co and Bayer Animal Health are approved to sell vaccines for the disease, according to the center. Slideshow (3 Images)Roth said “any injection into an animal might rarely produce an abscess” if the needle is dirty. However,  if abscesses are showing up in the meat, there has to be a failure in the slaughter plant because those should be caught and removed,” he said. The USDA had no immediate comment on whether foot-and-mouth vaccines or budget cuts have contributed to problems with Brazil’s fresh beef. The U.S. ban on Brazilian meat came three months after a broader crisis caused by a police investigation into alleged bribery of health officials by meatpackers including JBS SA, the world's largest protein processor. The union said the understaffing situation was also contributing to corruption since it is harder to bribe employees who work in tandem. While only the United States put in place an outright ban on fresh beef from Brazil, officials in Canada and the EU said on Friday they had rejected some shipments of Brazilian beef in recent months. The EU cited issues with Shiga toxin-producing E.coli in beef as well as salmonella in poultry.

The AHA's  Life's Simple 7  program focuses on seven goals: a healthy weight, a healthy diet, healthy physical activity levels, quitting smoking, and good control of blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol. The risk of high blood pressure decreased as the number of heart healthy habits followed by black Americans increased, researchers found. Starting in childhood, black Americans are at higher risk of high blood pressure than white Americans, the researchers write in the journal Hypertension. But while maintaining a healthy blood pressure is key to reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease, not many studies have focused specifically on ways to improve blood pressure control among black Americans.  This is such a high risk in this population, and it hasn’t been studied that much,  said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, an AHA spokesperson who wasn't involved in the new research. For the new study, the researchers studied 1,878 black Americans enrolled in the Jackson Heart Study in Mississippi. All of the participants were free of high blood pressure when they entered the study between 2000 and 2004, and they all received at least one follow-up exam. Over about eight years of follow-up, about half of the participants were diagnosed with high blood pressure. Overall, at the start of the study, about 57 percent of participants had two or three risk factors under control. Another 36 percent had control of four to six factors.  About 7 percent had just one risk factor, or none at all, under control. No one had control of all seven. During the study, the risk of developing high blood pressure was roughly 81 percent for people with control over one or no risk factors at the start of the study, 67 percent with two risk factors under control at the start, 55 percent in people with three risk factors under control, 33 percent when people had four risk factors under control, 26 percent when five factors were controlled, and 11 percent with six factors under control. The difference between people with control of one or no risk factors and those with control of six represents a 90 percent decreased risk of high blood pressure.  In looking at these healthy behaviors and factors, we see that with implementation of these the risk of hypertension and outcomes goes down significantly,  said Steinbaum, of Northwell Health's Lenox Hill Hospital in New York.  I think it’s a pretty powerful statement.  The researchers conclude that Life's Simple 7 may be a practical way to monitor the risk of high blood pressure among black Americans. For people looking to follow the AHA's Life's Simple 7, Steinbaum said it's about baby steps like cutting out sugary drinks such as juices. Removing those drinks leads to weight loss which may increase physical activity, she said.  One small change can really set off a whole pattern of behavior that can change your life,  she told Reuters Health. John Booth, the study's lead author from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Rosneft is suing Sistema for 170.6 billion roubles ($2.9 billion) in damages over the purchase of oil producer Bashneft (BANE.MM). Sistema proposed an out-of-court settlement last week.  Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev said the arrest of the shares, which halts their use but does not seize them, was a  security measure  and the shares arrested equaled the value of Rosneft claims against Sistema.  Sistema is one of the largest private holdings in Russia and is controlled by businessman Vladimir Yevtushenkov. MTS, with the market value of $8 billion according to Thomson Reuters data, is Sistema's largest asset. Sistema interests also include agriculture, real estate and other assets.  On Monday, Sistema said it had received notice of an enforcement action from the Moscow Directorate of the Federal Bailiffs Service and a copy of a court order from the Republic of Bashkortostan Arbitration Court. According to the court order, an arrest was imposed on a 31.76 percent stake in MTS, 100 percent of its Medsi chain of medical clinics, and 90.47 percent of Bashkirian Power Grid company owned by Sistema and its unit Sistema-Invest. Under the order, a relatively common device in Russia, Sistema still owns the shares but cannot carry out any action using them until the court allows it to. The court can order the shares to be seized, released or sold off as part of the dispute. Sistema owns a little over 50 percent in MTS, also present in Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia and Turkmenistan with a total 110 million clients.

It said it considered the demands  unlawful and unfounded . MTS said in a separate statement:  This situation does not impact operations with MTS shares, and the rights to receive dividends on MTS shares owned by other shareholders.   Bashneft, which produces around 400,000 barrels of crude oil a day, was owned by Sistema for a couple of years until 2014, when the court has ruled to return the company to the state.  Yevtushenkov himself was accused in 2014 of misappropriating Bashneft shares and held for three months under house arrest. The charges, which Sistema denied, were eventually dropped  Rosneft bought Bashneft from the state last year.   Shares are not being seized but a number of actions such as sale, purchase, usage as a collateral, are being suspended ...

A defense attorney called the case against Arpaio  ridiculous  and said the 85-year-old ex-lawman was just doing his job.  Arpaio, who was ousted from office in an election last November, is charged in U.S. District Court in Phoenix with contempt of court. Prosecutors say he defied a 2011 injunction that barred his deputies from stopping and detaining motorists solely on the suspicion of being in the country illegally.  During his opening remarks to the court, federal prosecutor Victor Salgado said the controversial traffic stops continued for about 18 months, with 170 people wrongfully detained.   He knew that the order was out there,  federal prosecutor Victor Salgado said during his opening statement.  He never thought this day would come.  Defense lawyer Dennis Wilenchik said the six-term sheriff would never have intentionally violated a court order and was simply carrying out his responsibilities as he understood them. This case is ridiculous and it is an assault on logic,  Wilenchik said. Arpaio, a nationally known figure who styled himself as  America’s toughest sheriff  during 24 years in office, criticized former President Barack Obama's Justice Department when he was charged. He said at the time that Democrats were playing politics during his 2016 campaign for reelection as sheriff.  He faces up to six months in jail if convicted. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton will render a verdict following proceedings that are expected to take at least two weeks.  Arpaio already has been cited by another judge for civil contempt for the continued traffic stops in the underlying profiling case. That judge found his office was guilty of racially profiling Latino drivers.  The ex-sheriff has admitted to the civil contempt, but said his actions were inadvertent and not willful or intentional - standards that would need to be proved for a criminal prosecution.  Several key rulings preceded Monday's trial. Bolton has ruled that Arpaio's words in the media and elsewhere can be used against him in court and that two people who were stopped by deputies would be allowed to testify. It was not known if Arpaio would take the stand in his own defense at the trial.

Green Chef, a meal kit company focused on organic and healthy items, has already raised $67 million and is about to launch a process to raise at least $50 million more, Chief Executive Michael Joseph said in an interview. Amazon's Whole Foods deal  sent a tidal wave  through the food industry, Joseph said, but he does not expect it to hurt meal kit companies, since they cater to a niche group of consumers with specific tastes. With such a small percentage of food currently being purchased online, there may be room for many players to grow, he added. Boulder, Colorado-based Green Chef is close to hiring a financial adviser to hold talks with strategic and financial investors, Joseph said. While Green Chef is on track to generate $100 million in revenue this year, it is not profitable because it is reinvesting in its business, he said. He declined to comment on the company's valuation.  While Green Chef would like to raise money to fund expansion, it could also look to be acquired, Joseph said.  If we find a buyer who is betting big into organic and wants to help grow this company, I'd be a fool to say, No, we wouldn't look, especially with market conditions like this where companies scrambling to get into the space,  he said. Meal kit delivery companies, which sell subscription services that deliver ingredients and recipes designed to let customers easily prepare meals at home, have grown in popularity in the last few years.  A host of young companies such as HelloFresh, Plated, Home Chef, Sun Basket and Chef'd have crowded into the space. Blue Apron, the meal kit industry's biggest company, is seeking a valuation of up to $3.2 billion, roughly three times its forward revenue, in an IPO this week. Green Chef differentiates itself by focusing on organic and healthy ingredients, some of which are delivered already chopped. It also makes its own sauces and has manufacturing plants in Colorado and New Jersey. Green Chef was founded by Joseph in 2014. Previous investors in the company include venture capital firms such as New Enterprise Associates, Greenspring Associates and a division of the Future Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Australia.

Cook met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a business summit in Washington at a time when Apple Inc is targeting the nascent Indian market as a revenue source after its sales in China slipped. Apple has asked Indian government officials for a range of tax and policy changes to help build out its iPhone assembly work in the country. It is seeking permission to open its own retail stores in India where it currently sells iPhones through resellers.  In his meeting with Modi, Cook disclosed that Apple expected its Indian operations to be run completely from renewable energy within the next six months, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Cook reiterated that Apple had generated 740,000 jobs in India through its so-called  app economy  and Indian developers had created nearly 100,000 apps for the App Store, the person said. Tim Cook, CEO, speaks during Apple's annual world wide developer conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California, U.S. June 5, 2017.Stephen LamModi talked with Cook and other U.S. corporate leaders ahead of a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday. Apple, working with contract manufacturer Winstron, began assembling the iPhone SE in Bengaluru last month. Indian authorities have offered Apple tax concessions for the work with the requirement that more local components be used over time. The company is looking to India after sales in the greater China region, once a major factor in Apple's rise, fell 14 percent year over year to $10.7 billion in the most recent quarter. Apple has not disclosed how much revenue it generates in India but said that sales grew by  strong double digits  there in the most recent quarter.  We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts,  Cook told analysts about Apple's efforts in India during the company's most recent earnings call.  We believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and it's continuing to be expanded, there is a huge opportunity for Apple there.

Also getting the call were Paul Kariya, Dave Andreychuk, Mark Recchi and Danielle Goyette, who becomes the fifth woman inducted into the hockey shrine. Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs and Canadian college coach Clare Drake were named to the Builders category. Selanne takes his place in the Hall on his first year of eligibility.  The Finn announced his arrival in the National Hockey League with an explosive rookie campaign with the Winnipeg Jets scoring 76 goals which is still a record for first-year players. In a career that spanned 23 years, Selanne collected 684 goals to sit 11th on the NHL's all-time list and 15th in career points with 1,451. A cornerstone of the Finnish national team, Selanne won four Olympic medals (one silver, three bronze) and is the Winter Games all-time leading scorer with 43 points.  To be honest I was a little bit waiting for the phone call today,  said Selanne in an interview with the sports television network TSN.  I was home, I was checking the phone just to make sure I don't miss any phone calls.  It's hard to believe.  When I was a little boy growing up here in Finland, if someone had told me I was going to be in the Hockey Hall of Fame one day it would be really, really hard to believe that.  Kariya, who spent part of his career as a team mate of Selanne's in Anaheim, scored 402 goals and had 989 points in 989 games in a career that was cut short by concussions. A member of Team Canada at two Olympics, Kariya won gold and silver medals. Andreychuk played 23 seasons, scoring 640 goals and 1,338 points in 1,639 games and capped his career by winning a Stanley Cup with the Tampa Bay Lightning. Recchi is just one of 10 players to win Stanley Cups with three different teams (Pittsburgh Penguins, Carolina Hurricanes and Boston Bruins). He had 577 career goals and 1,533 points, while his 1,652 regular season games are fifth most in NHL history. Goyette’s career includes seven gold medals at the women’s world championships and two Olympic gold. The 2017 induction ceremony will be held on Nov. 13 in Toronto.

Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Republican leadership who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday that he was concerned by China's attempts to ensure that its military catches up to the U.S. Defense Department in terms of technology.  China is using every tool at its disposal to close the technology gap between the United States and that country, and in the process, to eliminate our military's technological advantage,  he said in his speech. Cornyn's office provided Reuters with a copy of the address on Monday. To combat this, Cornyn plans to introduce a bill in Congress that would update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, an interagency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews proposed transactions to ensure they do not pose a challenge to national security. The law firm Covington and Burling LLP, which follows CFIUS, said in a note after the speech that it believed that Cornyn's proposed legislation  may ultimately become law.   Senator Cornyn is among the most influential members of the Senate, and there appears to be an emerging bipartisan consensus that CFIUS should be strengthened,  the firm said in an analysis on Friday. Cornyn said the legislation would be called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, and would ensure that CFIUS focuses its investigations on countries which pose the biggest threat to the United States. It would also give CFIUS the authority to look at a broader range of deals, including joint ventures based outside the United States and smaller, minority-position investments which would give the investing companies access to sensitive information, Cornyn said. Cornyn's office did not respond to a query on Monday regarding when the bill would be introduced. CFIUS already has a reputation for being tough on high-tech deals, and has been known in particular to block transactions that involve sophisticated semiconductors. The bill will not expand the committee, which will disappoint those who had pushed for the Agriculture Department to become a member of the panel.

Shares of the company, formerly a part of Alcoa, fell as much as 11.3 percent after Reuters reported on Saturday it had supplied the cladding knowing it would be used at Grenfell Tower, despite warning in its brochures those specific panels were a fire risk for tall buildings. Lawyers told Reuters that Arconic could face lawsuits on both sides of the Atlantic over its role in the fire, including claims brought by victims and their families, although the extent of the company's legal liabilities is not clear. Arconic did not immediately reply to a request for comment on potential legal action. Announcing the end of sales of the panels for tall buildings, Arconic cited  inconsistencies in building codes around the world  and code compliance issues that have arisen concerning use of cladding systems as a result of the Grenfell Tower fire. UK authorities said the use of the panels in Grenfell Tower was in breach of UK building regulations. Arconic declined to comment on whether the material met UK building regulations, saying it was for local contractors and officials to decide whether or not its materials were suitable and consistent with local regulations. Other companies involved in the refurbishment of the building in which the Arconic cladding material was fitted said they complied with all local rules. Nonetheless, Arconic advised in one brochure seen by Reuters that combustible cladding materials were a fire risk in tall buildings and that above 30 metres (98 ft) non-combustible materials should be used. Its polyethylene (PE) panel material is combustible. Grenfell Tower is more than 60 metres high.  The issue is they supplied material that was used above their own marketing material's suggested limit,  said Seaport Global Securities analyst Josh Sullivan.  The concern is around the ultimate liability. You have one of the largest fires in UK history and they're searching for somebody to be at fault.  The stock clawed back some losses after Monday's announcement and closed down 6 percent at $24.01 as more than five times the usual number of shares changed hands. Arconic's junk bonds fell by up to 2.5 points. Litigation Fears Arconic was created last year as Alcoa's specialty metals business, while the bauxite and aluminum businesses were split off under the Alcoa name. Last month Arconic emerged from a bruising battle with activist investor Elliott Management, during which its chief executive resigned. The Reuters report on Saturday cited six emails from 2014 between Deborah French, UK sales manager at Arconic - then called Alcoa - and executives at the contractors involved in the bidding process for Grenfell Tower's refurbishment contract. These showed Arconic knew it was supplying for a building called  Grenfell Tower  but not whether the company knew the building's exact height. The company declined to say if it knew this. Lawyers told Reuters that plaintiffs could argue the company acted negligently by supplying material it knew was flammable. Thomas Jervis, a London-based lawyer at the firm Leigh Day who represents plaintiffs, said his firm has already been contacted by potential clients affected by the fire. Lawyers said that since most of the companies involved in work at Grenfell Tower were small, plaintiffs are likely to pursue Arconic as the only deep-pocketed party. Claimants could be attracted by the fact that damages settlements in the United States tend to be much bigger than those in the UK, where punitive damages are limited and most awards focus on actual losses and lost future income, which is based on victims' earnings capacity. But any claims could be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, said Duncan Fairgrieve, a senior research fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. “U.S. courts have become less keen to hear cases which have really occurred in and have strong links to other jurisdictions,” he said. While the extent of Arconic's responsibility was not immediately clear, investors were taking a  sell now and ask questions later  approach, according to Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York, New York. The company has said it will continue to support UK authorities as they investigate the June 14 fire.

Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Republican leadership who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday that he was concerned by China's attempts to ensure that its military catches up to the U.S. Defense Department in terms of technology.  China is using every tool at its disposal to close the technology gap between the United States and that country, and in the process, to eliminate our military's technological advantage,  he said in his speech. Cornyn's office provided Reuters with a copy of the address on Monday. To combat this, Cornyn plans to introduce a bill in Congress that would update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, an interagency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews proposed transactions to ensure they do not pose a challenge to national security. The law firm Covington and Burling LLP, which follows CFIUS, said in a note after the speech that it believed that Cornyn's proposed legislation  may ultimately become law.   Senator Cornyn is among the most influential members of the Senate, and there appears to be an emerging bipartisan consensus that CFIUS should be strengthened,  the firm said in an analysis on Friday. Cornyn said the legislation would be called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, and would ensure that CFIUS focuses its investigations on countries which pose the biggest threat to the United States. It would also give CFIUS the authority to look at a broader range of deals, including joint ventures based outside the United States and smaller, minority-position investments which would give the investing companies access to sensitive information, Cornyn said. Cornyn's office did not respond to a query on Monday regarding when the bill would be introduced. CFIUS already has a reputation for being tough on high-tech deals, and has been known in particular to block transactions that involve sophisticated semiconductors. The bill will not expand the committee, which will disappoint those who had pushed for the Agriculture Department to become a member of the panel.

Green Chef, a meal kit company focused on organic and healthy items, has already raised $67 million and is about to launch a process to raise at least $50 million more, Chief Executive Michael Joseph said in an interview. Amazon's Whole Foods deal  sent a tidal wave  through the food industry, Joseph said, but he does not expect it to hurt meal kit companies, since they cater to a niche group of consumers with specific tastes. With such a small percentage of food currently being purchased online, there may be room for many players to grow, he added. Boulder, Colorado-based Green Chef is close to hiring a financial adviser to hold talks with strategic and financial investors, Joseph said. While Green Chef is on track to generate $100 million in revenue this year, it is not profitable because it is reinvesting in its business, he said. He declined to comment on the company's valuation.  While Green Chef would like to raise money to fund expansion, it could also look to be acquired, Joseph said.  If we find a buyer who is betting big into organic and wants to help grow this company, I'd be a fool to say, No, we wouldn't look, especially with market conditions like this where companies scrambling to get into the space,  he said. Meal kit delivery companies, which sell subscription services that deliver ingredients and recipes designed to let customers easily prepare meals at home, have grown in popularity in the last few years.  A host of young companies such as HelloFresh, Plated, Home Chef, Sun Basket and Chef'd have crowded into the space. Blue Apron, the meal kit industry's biggest company, is seeking a valuation of up to $3.2 billion, roughly three times its forward revenue, in an IPO this week. Green Chef differentiates itself by focusing on organic and healthy ingredients, some of which are delivered already chopped. It also makes its own sauces and has manufacturing plants in Colorado and New Jersey. Green Chef was founded by Joseph in 2014. Previous investors in the company include venture capital firms such as New Enterprise Associates, Greenspring Associates and a division of the Future Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Australia.

Prime Minister Edi Rama asked voters to give him a mandate in Sunday's vote that would help his party ditch smaller ones and govern alone so as to expedite anti-corruption reforms to the judiciary called for by the EU. With 4,455 ballot boxes counted out of a total of 5,362, the Socialists had won 48 percent of the vote, which would give them 73 seats in the 140-seat parliament, while the main opposition Democratic Party had won 29 percent, or 43 seats.      According to all data, we shall be in the driving seat,  Rama told party members shortly after polls closed on Sunday. Klement Zguri, the chief election officer, urged parties to ask counters to speed up the count of the last 907 ballot boxes. A scuffle between counters in a small seaside town was resolved peacefully, but counting in hot, steamy halls full of cigarette smoke proceeded slowly in the larger regions. Voter turnout of 44.9 percent was one the lowest rates since Albania ditched communism in the early 1990s, probably due to the heat and the end-of-Ramadan celebration observed by Muslims who account for 60 percent of the population.  Election officials start counting the votes from the parliamentary elections in Tirana, Albania June 26, 2017.Florion GogaRama and opposition leader Lulzim Basha put off the vote by a week after reaching a deal in May in which the opposition called off a 90-day boycott of parliament in exchange for six cabinet posts including the interior ministry. The move aimed to discourage election fraud and helped defuse tension overall. Some 400 international observers watched the vote, keen to see Albania shed its history of violent and contested elections.  The contestants campaigned freely, fundamental freedoms were respected in Albania's elections, but politicized election administration reduced trust in the process,  international observers said in a preliminary statement in Tirana. Election officials start counting the votes from the parliamentary elections in Tirana, Albania June 26, 2017.Florion GogaEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn said the election was held in a  calm and orderly manner  and urged observers to provide a fuller report on allegations of vote-buying and pressure on voters.  Once the electoral process has been completed, we will engage with the new government to support the reform process and proceed on the EU integration process,  they said in a statement.  The continuation of justice reform and the fight against drug trafficking and cultivation will be of particular importance in this respect,  Mogherini and Hahn added.     Implementing sweeping judicial reform aimed at rooting out widespread graft will be a priority for the next government as it seeks progress toward joining the EU. Rama said last month Albania could get a green light for formal EU talks to start at the end of this year, but Mogherini and Hahn did not mention the prospect of any such talks.

All countries in the region need to do more to combat terrorism, but recent disputes among the GCC countries only serve to hurt efforts to fight ISIS and counter Iran,  Republican Senator Bob Corker wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.  His action could increase pressure on members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to settle the crisis. The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.  Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates imposed a boycott on Qatar, their tiny but wealthy neighbor, on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism. They have sent it 13 demands including closing al Jazeera television, curbing relations with Iran, and paying reparations. Under U.S. law, major foreign U.S. arms sales are submitted for review to a small group of lawmakers, including the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, before they can go ahead. Trump considered Corker as a potential vice president and secretary of state, and he works closely with the White House. The administration would be unlikely to ignore his resistance to the arms sales, and U.S. officials said they considered his statement part of a broader effort to solve the Qatar crisis. A State Department official noted that Tillerson called on Sunday for the countries involved to sit down together and discuss ways forward. The official declined comment on arms sales beyond saying the department remains committed to working with lawmakers. It was not immediately clear what sales would be affected. Trump has announced billions of dollars in arms sales since taking office in January. He sees weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States. A Corker aide said his action would not affect sales that had already been reviewed by Congress or non-lethal assistance, including training. One sale already cleared by Congress was for up to $350 billion in precision-guided munitions and other offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia. In his letter, Corker said he was pleased with Trump's recent trip to Saudi Arabia, which included a GCC summit.   Unfortunately, the GCC did not take advantage of the summit and instead chose to devolve into conflict,  Corker wrote.

Richard Anderson, who spearheaded Delta's growth into the world's largest airline by market value when he retired as chief executive in May 2016, will become president and co-CEO on July 12, two days after Amtrak launches the rebuilding program at New York City's Pennsylvania Station. He and Wick Moorman, who became CEO in September and recruited Anderson, will share the top job until Dec. 31. Moorman will then become an advisor to the company, Amtrak said in a statement. The repairs, estimated to cost $30 million to $40 million over several years, was expedited after recent derailments and other problems from decaying infrastructure left hundreds of thousands of commuters delayed throughout the greater New York City area. It is expected to cause major service disruptions this summer across the metropolitan region.  The project has caused a rift between Amtrak, the station owner, and the two states that use most of the hub's track space, New York and New Jersey. The Trump administration in May proposed ending $630 million in subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service, out of $1.4 billion in annual government support for passenger rail service. FILE PHOTO: Charles (Wick) Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern Corporation, speaks during an interview during the Business Council meeting of U.S. Executives in Cary, North Carolina, October 15, 2009.Jason Arthurs/File Photo For the year ending Sept. 30, Amtrak posted its highest ever total revenue of $3.2 billion and had a record 31.3 million passengers, with more than one-third of them in the Northeast Corridor. Its unaudited operating loss of $227 million was the smallest since 1973. Airlines and Amtrak compete for passengers, especially on busy routes between Boston and Washington. Slideshow (2 Images) Anderson was among the most outspoken U.S. airline industry leaders. He assumed Delta's top job in 2007 and led the company through a merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008. During his tenure, Delta outpaced its peers in on-time performance, grew rapidly in top business markets such as New York and acquired stakes in airlines in the United Kingdom, China, Mexico and Brazil.    Amtrak Chairman Anthony Coscia said in an interview on Monday that Anderson had transformed Delta from a bankrupt airline, from 2005 to 2007,  to one that was considered the industry standard for customer service.  He noted the challenge of serving record passenger rail traffic in an industry that has been underinvested for decades. Moorman retired in 2015 as chairman, CEO and president of Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) before taking the helm at Amtrak.

The slow-growing, high-dividend S&P; utilities .SPLRCU and telecommunications .SPLRCL were the best performers among the 11 S&P; sectors.   Technology .SPLRCT was the weakest sector, with a 0.6 percent decline. The sector been under pressure recently due to stretched valuations.     The bond market is signaling an economic slowing,  said  Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  That's why you're seeing defensive names like utilities do well, because equity investors are buying more in line with what that bond market is saying.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 14.79 points, or 0.07 percent, to 21,409.55, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 0.77 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,439.07 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 18.10 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,247.15. A fall in Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) weighed most on the S&P; 500, as well as on the Nasdaq.  It's simply profit-taking going into the end of the quarter. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see that reversed in early July with the thought that we're going to see some strong earnings,  said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York.  The utilities sector was the S&P;'s best performer, with a 0.8 percent rise, while the four-company telecommunications services sector index was next with a 0.6 percent gain.  If people are coming out of tech the money just rotates into the other sectors. There's not much driving the tape as there's not much news out there,  said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. The S&P; energy .SPNY ended 0.2 percent lower as gains in oil prices were limited by rising crude supply in the United States and other countries.  A recent drop in oil prices has spurred concerns about low inflation, which remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target rate. The Fed raised rates this month for the second time this year and has indicated it could raise them again. But futures imply only a 50 percent chance of another rate hike by December. The S&P; financial index .SPSY rose 0.5 percent after New York Fed President William Dudley and San Francisco Fed President John Williams generally brushed off weak data and stuck by their plans to keep hiking rates. Monday's data showed new orders for U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May, with non-defense orders excluding aircraft - a closely watched proxy for business spending plans - dropping 0.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 0.3 percent.

Richard Anderson, who spearheaded Delta's growth into the world's largest airline by market value when he retired as chief executive in May 2016, will become president and co-CEO on July 12, two days after Amtrak launches the rebuilding program at New York City's Pennsylvania Station. He and Wick Moorman, who became CEO in September and recruited Anderson, will share the top job until Dec. 31. Moorman will then become an advisor to the company, Amtrak said in a statement. The repairs, estimated to cost $30 million to $40 million over several years, was expedited after recent derailments and other problems from decaying infrastructure left hundreds of thousands of commuters delayed throughout the greater New York City area. It is expected to cause major service disruptions this summer across the metropolitan region.  The project has caused a rift between Amtrak, the station owner, and the two states that use most of the hub's track space, New York and New Jersey. The Trump administration in May proposed ending $630 million in subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service, out of $1.4 billion in annual government support for passenger rail service. FILE PHOTO: Charles (Wick) Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern Corporation, speaks during an interview during the Business Council meeting of U.S. Executives in Cary, North Carolina, October 15, 2009.Jason Arthurs/File Photo For the year ending Sept. 30, Amtrak posted its highest ever total revenue of $3.2 billion and had a record 31.3 million passengers, with more than one-third of them in the Northeast Corridor. Its unaudited operating loss of $227 million was the smallest since 1973. Airlines and Amtrak compete for passengers, especially on busy routes between Boston and Washington. Slideshow (2 Images) Anderson was among the most outspoken U.S. airline industry leaders. He assumed Delta's top job in 2007 and led the company through a merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008. During his tenure, Delta outpaced its peers in on-time performance, grew rapidly in top business markets such as New York and acquired stakes in airlines in the United Kingdom, China, Mexico and Brazil.    Amtrak Chairman Anthony Coscia said in an interview on Monday that Anderson had transformed Delta from a bankrupt airline, from 2005 to 2007,  to one that was considered the industry standard for customer service.  He noted the challenge of serving record passenger rail traffic in an industry that has been underinvested for decades. Moorman retired in 2015 as chairman, CEO and president of Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) before taking the helm at Amtrak.

Green, 40, was arrested at his home in a suburb of Green Bay, Wisconsin, and charged with physical abuse of a child and disorderly conduct after a neighbor called police when the girl fled his home, police said in papers filed in Brown County Circuit Court. The former National Football League star running back told responding officers that he struck the girl and shoved her late on Sunday after a day-long dispute over household chores, police said. A representative of Lammi Sports Management, which represents Green, declined to comment. It could not immediately be learned if Green had hired an attorney. The abuse charge carries a penalty of up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Green played in the NFL from 1998 through 2009, including eight seasons with the Packers.

The slow-growing, high-dividend S&P; utilities .SPLRCU and telecommunications .SPLRCL were the best performers among the 11 S&P; sectors.   Technology .SPLRCT was the weakest sector, with a 0.6 percent decline. The sector been under pressure recently due to stretched valuations.     The bond market is signaling an economic slowing,  said  Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  That's why you're seeing defensive names like utilities do well, because equity investors are buying more in line with what that bond market is saying.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 14.79 points, or 0.07 percent, to 21,409.55, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 0.77 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,439.07 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 18.10 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,247.15. A fall in Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) weighed most on the S&P; 500, as well as on the Nasdaq.  It's simply profit-taking going into the end of the quarter. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see that reversed in early July with the thought that we're going to see some strong earnings,  said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York.  The utilities sector was the S&P;'s best performer, with a 0.8 percent rise, while the four-company telecommunications services sector index was next with a 0.6 percent gain.  If people are coming out of tech the money just rotates into the other sectors. There's not much driving the tape as there's not much news out there,  said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. The S&P; energy .SPNY ended 0.2 percent lower as gains in oil prices were limited by rising crude supply in the United States and other countries.  A recent drop in oil prices has spurred concerns about low inflation, which remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target rate. The Fed raised rates this month for the second time this year and has indicated it could raise them again. But futures imply only a 50 percent chance of another rate hike by December. The S&P; financial index .SPSY rose 0.5 percent after New York Fed President William Dudley and San Francisco Fed President John Williams generally brushed off weak data and stuck by their plans to keep hiking rates. Monday's data showed new orders for U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May, with non-defense orders excluding aircraft - a closely watched proxy for business spending plans - dropping 0.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 0.3 percent. Shares in Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ.N) closed up 13.5 percent at $10.83 after a report that Apple Inc APPL.O is leasing a small fleet of cars from the rental company to test self-driving technology.

With the change, gasoline imported and sold in Mexico will be more similar to that sold in the United States.   Gas stations in Mexico can't offer gasoline similar to that sold in the United States of America because norms prohibit such gasoline from being sold in Mexico,  CRE said in the official gazette.  This situation, in addition to being a disadvantage for the already established gas stations in Mexico, represents a barrier for those who plan to import into Mexico gasoline used in the United States of America,  CRE added. The measure, which will take effect on Tuesday, affects gasoline only, not diesel. It will exclude Mexico City and a host of surrounding municipalities in the State of Mexico, as well as Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco state and Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo Leon.

According to a Monday court filing, the settlement will strip the estates of Andrew and Mark Madoff of  all assets, cash, and other proceeds  of their father's fraud, leaving them with a respective $2 million and $1.75 million. The estates also agreed to withdraw roughly $99.5 million of claims against the bankruptcy estate of the former Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, the filing shows. Monday's settlement resolves some the highest-profile cases remaining in trustee Irving Picard's efforts to compensate former Madoff customers who he estimates lost $17.5 billion. He has recovered $11.6 billion, or about two-thirds of that sum. The settlement also resolves claims against Mark Madoff's widow, Stephanie Mack, and some entities affiliated with the Madoff family. It also ends an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, whose criminal probe resulted in a 150-year prison term for Bernard Madoff, a 10-year term for his brother Peter, and 13 other convictions and guilty pleas. Madoff's sons were never criminally charged, and had maintained they knew nothing about their father's fraud until he confessed to them shortly before his Dec. 11, 2008 arrest. But in a civil lawsuit, Picard said Madoff's firm operated as a family piggy bank, and sought to recoup $153.3 million from the sons' estates alone. Settlement talks began in 2015, and the accord is a  global and complete resolution of all claims  against the estates, lawyers for Picard said in Monday's filing. Mark Madoff committed suicide in December 2010 at age 46. Andrew Madoff died of cancer in September 2014 at age 48. Their father is 79. Lawyers for Picard could not immediately be reached for comment. Martin Flumenbaum, a lawyer for the Madoff sons' estates, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Alan Levine, a lawyer for Mack, declined to comment. The office of Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan had no immediate comment. A separate $4 billion fund overseen by former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden expects this year to begin payouts to Madoff victims, including third parties. The case is Picard v Madoff et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-ap-01503. The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in the same court, No. 08-01789.

The justices, in a 7-2 ruling, sided with Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Missouri, which sued after being denied access to a state grant program that helps nonprofit groups buy rubber playground surfaces made from recycled tires. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the court's majority, said that  the exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution  and  cannot stand.  Missouri's constitution prohibits  any church, sect or denomination of religion  or clergy member from receiving state money, language that goes further than the U.S. Constitution's separation of church and state. Three-quarters of the U.S. states have provisions similar to Missouri's barring funding for religious entities. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion saying the court had swept away legal precedents that allow for limits on state funding of churches. Fellow liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg also dissented.  This case is about nothing less than the relationship between religious institutions and the civil government - that is between church and state. The court today profoundly changes that relationship by holding for the first time that the Constitution requires the government to provide public funds directly to a church,  Sotomayor wrote. The ruling could help religious organizations nationwide win public dollars at least for certain purposes, such as health and safety. It also could buttress the case for using publicly funded vouchers to send children to religious schools rather than public schools. A challenge to a 2015 court decision invalidating a Colorado voucher program is pending before the justices, awaiting the Trinity Lutheran case's outcome. The court could act on that case as soon as Tuesday. Republican President Donald Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is a prominent supporter of such  school choice  plans. Roberts, in a footnote in the ruling, said,  This case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing. We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer called the ruling a  significant victory for religious liberty and an affirmation of the First Amendment rights of all Americans.  A police officer stands outside the U.S. Supreme Court building after the Court sided with Trinity Lutheran Church, which objected to being denied public money in Missouri, in Washington, U.S., June 26, 2017.Yuri Gripas This ruling reaffirms that the government cannot discriminate against individuals or organizations simply because they or their members hold religious beliefs,  Spicer added. The dispute pitted two provisions of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment against each other: the guarantee of the free exercise of religion and the Establishment Clause, which requires the separation of church and state. The discrimination against religious exercise in this case was Missouri's refusal to allow Trinity Lutheran  solely because it is a church  to compete with secular organizations for a grant, Roberts wrote. Trinity Lutheran, which runs a preschool and daycare center, had wanted a safer surface for its playground. 'Commonsense Principle'  The Supreme Court's decision today affirms the commonsense principle that government isn't being neutral when it treats religious organizations worse than everyone else,  said David Cortman, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom conservative Christian legal group who argued the case.  Equal treatment of a religious organization in a program that provides only secular benefits, like a partial reimbursement grant for playground surfacing, isn't a government endorsement of religion,  Cortman added. Trinity Lutheran argued that Missouri's policy violated its right to exercise religion as well as the U.S. Constitution's promise of equal protection under the law. Missouri argued there was nothing unconstitutional about its grant program, noting that Trinity Lutheran remained free to practice its faith however it wants despite being refused state funds. Daniel Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's program on freedom of religion and belief, expressed disappointment in the ruling.   Religious freedom should protect unwilling taxpayers from funding church property, not force them to foot the bill. The court's ruling, however, focuses specifically on grants for playground resurfacing, and does not give the government unlimited authority to fund religious activity,  Mach said. The justices overturned a 2015 ruling by the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2015 upheld a trial court's dismissal of the suit. Just before the April oral argument, Missouri's Republican governor, Eric Greitens, reversed the state policy that had banned religious entities from applying for the grant money.

In general we have really good results but for sure ... many aspects should be improved,  Massimo Busacca told a news conference.  VAR involves two video assistant referees who monitor the action on screens and draw the match referee's attention to officiating mistakes. FIFA has already said it would like to use video assistant referees at the 2018 World Cup, and soccer's law-making body IFAB is expected to decide next March whether to allow them to become part of the game on a permanent basis. But their use has caused confusion at the Confederations Cup, especially during Sunday's match between Germany and Cameroon when on-field official Wilmar Roldan needed two reviews of an incident to send off the correct Cameroon player. Cameroon coach Hugo Broos complained that he did not understand what was going on.  I have to agree, it was too long... but in the end the right player was sent off,  said Busacca.  There was also controversy when a video review denied Chile a legitimate-looking goal in their 2-0 win against Cameroon on June 18, and it was used again at the end of the same match to overturn a linesman's offside call and award Chile a goal Main Criticism But the main criticisms are the time taken to make decisions and the referees' criteria in deciding when to use the system, with some close calls being made without consulting the VARs. Busacca accepted that reviews could take the gloss off goal celebrations.  It can reduce at some moments the enjoyment of soccer because you have a celebration and then suddenly a review and you have to change -- so people can have to live with this,  he said.  In 12 group stage matches at the Confederations Cup, video review helped correct six  game-changing decisions,  Busacca said.  Match officials ruled correctly on another 29  major incidents  with the help of the technology, he added.  It's important to mention today that clear mistakes were not missed,  he said. Busacca noted that if used correctly, the system could reduce many mistakes but not eliminate them completely. FIFA was keen on convincing member federations to use video review, he added. Despite the controversy, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said this month he was extremely happy with its use at the tournament.

Stocks were volatile on Wall Street, with defensive sectors emerging as the best performers as the S&P; 500 eked out a small gain. A massive trade in gold futures as Europe opened for trading dragged the contract to a six-week low. European shares rose the most in five sessions as banks rallied after Italy reached a deal to wind up two failed regional lenders. Nestle (NESN.S) jumped 4.3 percent, the most in almost six years, after an activist investor urged changes at the world's largest food company. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.41 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.13 percent. Bank stocks .SX7P rose after an agreement in which Italy's largest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), will take on the remaining good assets of collapsed Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. But across the Atlantic, new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 14.79 points, or 0.07 percent, to 21,409.55, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 0.77 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,439.07 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 18.10 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,247.15. Emerging market stocks rose 0.81 percent. The best performing sectors on the S&P; 500 were telecoms and utilities, so-called bond proxies because of their relative higher yield and lower volatility.  The bond market is signaling an economic slowing,  said  Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, pointing to a flatter yield curve.  That's why you're seeing defensive names (in stocks) like utilities do well because equity investors are buying more in line with what that bond market is saying.  Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell after the soft new capital goods orders data. The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve speakers including New York Fed President William Dudley have indicated further monetary policy tightening is likely even as economic data disappoints.

Cook met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a business summit in Washington at a time when Apple Inc is targeting the nascent Indian market as a revenue source after its sales in China slipped. Apple has asked Indian government officials for a range of tax and policy changes to help build out its iPhone assembly work in the country. It is seeking permission to open its own retail stores in India where it currently sells iPhones through resellers.  In his meeting with Modi, Cook disclosed that Apple expected its Indian operations to be run completely from renewable energy within the next six months, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Cook reiterated that Apple had generated 740,000 jobs in India through its so-called  app economy  and Indian developers had created nearly 100,000 apps for the App Store, the person said. Tim Cook, CEO, speaks during Apple's annual world wide developer conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California, U.S. June 5, 2017.Stephen LamModi talked with Cook and other U.S. corporate leaders ahead of a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday. Apple, working with contract manufacturer Winstron, began assembling the iPhone SE in Bengaluru last month. Indian authorities have offered Apple tax concessions for the work with the requirement that more local components be used over time. The company is looking to India after sales in the greater China region, once a major factor in Apple's rise, fell 14 percent year over year to $10.7 billion in the most recent quarter. Apple has not disclosed how much revenue it generates in India but said that sales grew by  strong double digits  there in the most recent quarter.  We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts,  Cook told analysts about Apple's efforts in India during the company's most recent earnings call.  We believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and it's continuing to be expanded, there is a huge opportunity for Apple there.

Stocks were volatile on Wall Street, with defensive sectors emerging as the best performers as the S&P; 500 eked out a small gain. A massive trade in gold futures as Europe opened for trading dragged the contract to a six-week low. European shares rose the most in five sessions as banks rallied after Italy reached a deal to wind up two failed regional lenders. Nestle (NESN.S) jumped 4.3 percent, the most in almost six years, after an activist investor urged changes at the world's largest food company. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.41 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.13 percent. Bank stocks .SX7P rose after an agreement in which Italy's largest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), will take on the remaining good assets of collapsed Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. But across the Atlantic, new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 14.79 points, or 0.07 percent, to 21,409.55, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 0.77 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,439.07 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 18.10 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,247.15. Emerging market stocks rose 0.81 percent. The best performing sectors on the S&P; 500 were telecoms and utilities, so-called bond proxies because of their relative higher yield and lower volatility.  The bond market is signaling an economic slowing,  said  Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, pointing to a flatter yield curve.  That's why you're seeing defensive names (in stocks) like utilities do well because equity investors are buying more in line with what that bond market is saying.  Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell after the soft new capital goods orders data. The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve speakers including New York Fed President William Dudley have indicated further monetary policy tightening is likely even as economic data disappoints.

Senior officials from the U.S. Treasury and other government departments have turned to these otherwise confidential accounts several times a year to analyze the asset holdings of the central banks of Russia, China, Iraq, Turkey, Yemen, Libya and others, according to more than a dozen current and former senior Fed and Treasury officials. The U.S. central bank keeps a tight lid on information contained in these accounts. But according to the officials interviewed by Reuters, U.S. authorities regularly use a  need to know  confidentiality exception in the Fed's service contracts with foreign central banks. The exception has allowed Treasury, State and Fed officials without regular access to glean information about the movement of funds in and out of the accounts, those people said. Such information has helped Washington monitor economic sanctions, fight terror financing and money laundering, or get a fuller picture of market hot spots around the world. Some 250 foreign central banks and governments keep $3.3 trillion of their assets at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, about half of the world's official dollar reserves, using a service advertised in a 2015 slide presentation as  safe and confidential.  The Bank for International Settlements, other major central banks and some commercial banks offer similar services, and clients usually have more than just one account. But only the Fed offers direct access to U.S. debt markets and to the world's reserve currency, the dollar, making the U.S. central bank the top provider of this so-called custodial banking business. In all, the people interviewed by Reuters identified seven instances in the last 15 years in which the accounts gave U.S. authorities insights into the actions of foreign counterparts or market movements, at times leading to a specific U.S. response. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2tDxp7V) In one relatively recent case, data from these foreign accounts offered U.S. authorities a sense of the mood in Moscow in March 2014, after Russia's invasion of Crimea prompted the United States to respond with economic sanctions. When foreign holdings at the New York Fed plunged about $115 billion, U.S. officials confirmed what others could only suspect, according to two former Fed officials: Russia's central bank had pulled its funds. While the Kremlin's public response was defiant, Fed and Treasury officials concluded Moscow feared the United States would freeze Russia's assets even though the account was not included in the narrow scope of the sanctions, according to one former official. After about two weeks, Russia's central bank returned most of the money to its Fed account, but the incident made officials monitor the account more closely for signs the sanctions had forced Moscow to draw down its reserves, the same source said. It was unclear what effect the sanctions had. The Bank of Russia said it would not comment on  details of its operations and interaction with partners.  The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to an emailed query. No Promise The Fed acknowledged the practice of disclosing account intelligence, but declined to comment on individual clients.  While our account agreement does provide for the sharing of information with the U.S. government in limited circumstances, we require a clearly demonstrated need for the information and a commitment that the information will be treated confidentially,  said a New York Fed spokeswoman.  This exception has been used on rare occasions and on a limited basis for such issues as compliance with sanctions requirements and anti-money laundering principles.  The insights into the Fed operation come at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump threatens new economic sanctions on countries that could again be monitored through the foreign accounts. It also comes as U.S. intelligence-gathering has come under intense public scrutiny, with agencies investigating Russian meddling in last year's election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign. The Senate this month backed new sanctions on Russia in part to punish it for the meddling, while the Treasury added individuals and entities to those sanctioned over Moscow's actions in Ukraine. According to a draft account agreement the New York Fed published online last year, the Treasury or any other U.S. government agency or Fed bank must have  a need to know such information  to access it. Seven people with direct knowledge of instances in which this exception was used told Reuters there was no working definition of the  need to know,  and that New York Fed lawyers would usually decide case by case. The level of scrutiny by U.S. authorities and lack of clarity over what would constitute a  need to know  surprised some former foreign central bankers who spoke to Reuters. The Bank of France, which also maintains foreign accounts, guarantees  full confidentiality  for its clients unless information is needed in a criminal investigation, said Christian Noyer, who was governor from 2003 to 2015.  It's only in that case,  he said in an interview.  It's not just to look at them and to know that.  Less surprising was the fact that the United States leveraged the Fed's position at the center of global finance, they said.  The kinds of powerful central banks that can offer these services ... will want to use that power in ways that benefit their public remit,  Patrick Honohan, governor of the Central Bank of Ireland from 2009 to 2015, told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: The seal for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is displayed in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 14, 2017.Joshua Roberts/File PhotoEdwin Truman, who headed the Fed Board of Governors' international finance division for more than two decades before joining the Treasury in 1998, said the Fed's clients should not expect absolute secrecy.  There is no promise to clients that the information in their accounts will not be shared with U.S. official circles,  Truman, now a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview.  A Treasury spokesman said the department monitors transactions and collects data from all financial firms  both routinely and in the course of investigations (and) has the ability to request information from banks beyond the 'need to know' provision.  He declined to comment on interactions with the New York Fed. Treasury Calling The U.S. officials interviewed by Reuters included executives and division heads, and people directly involved in discussions in which the confidentiality exception was used to analyze accounts that otherwise only a select group of Fed officials monitors. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity. Day to day, a team of about a dozen New York Fed analysts oversees the accounts. This low-profile unit, called Central Bank and International Account Services (CBIAS), came under the spotlight last year when it transferred $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account into the hands of hackers in one of the largest cyber heists ever. The unit manages mostly Treasury and agency debt. It also oversees more than 500,000 gold bars that have accumulated in underground vaults since the New York Fed first opened accounts for Britain and France a century ago. Slideshow (5 Images)The requests for information became more frequent after the passage of the 2001 U.S. Patriot Act, mostly from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a Treasury division enforcing sanctions and targeting terrorist financing, money laundering, and weapons and drugs trafficking. The Department can also subpoena confidential information. Among the requests since then have been inquiries about the accounts belonging to Turkey, Iraq, Russia and others, often to help determine whether official funds were being used to finance sanctioned groups or individuals, according to three of the sources. A few countries of keen interest to the U.S. government have little or no funds at the New York Fed - such as Iran, which is sanctioned, and Saudi Arabia, which is not. An official at Turkey's central bank said  operations are routinely carried out according to a correspondent banking agreement with the New York Fed, which is the standard operational procedure in correspondent banking.  Iraq's central bank stands out among those subject to U.S. scrutiny because of the extent of cooperation between Baghdad and New York. Earlier this month, based on information and instructions from the Fed's foreign accounts team, the Central Bank of Iraq blacklisted a money exchange firm suspected of ties with Islamic State and Al Qaeda. The Al-Kawthar money exchange firm, from the town of Qaim near the Syrian border, had its assets frozen in the action. Fed officials rely on meetings and conference calls to advise the Iraqi central bank on how to track and freeze out local firms suspected of terrorist connections or of helping Iran bypass sanctions, an Iraq central bank official told Reuters.  We have direct contact with the foreign assets monitoring office in the Fed,  the official said. In freezing the assets of Al-Kawthar, Iraq's central bank followed Fed  verification procedures,  added the official, who declined to be named. The U.S. Treasury announced the sanctions against Al-Kawthar on June 15, citing $2.5 million in money transfers it allegedly made to a firm linked to Islamic State facilitators. The owner of the money exchange firm was not available to comment.  Sometimes, a peek into the Fed accounts has provided the Treasury insight into market upheaval. At the height of the global financial crisis in 2008, Treasury officials asked the New York Fed whether one of its clients was behind plummeting demand for short-term debt of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to a former CBIAS official. An analysis of the accounts showed that China's central bank had curbed purchases, and that intelligence factored into the U.S. government's decision to seize the agencies in September 2008, the person said. The People's Bank of China declined to comment. In some cases, the Fed team handling the foreign accounts would activate the  need to know  clause if it spotted something unusual, two former Fed officials said. Since the 2010 Arab Spring uprisings, for example, the New York Fed has made several inquiries with the State Department about Yemeni and Libyan assets, according to one of these officials. The Fed team, which ranks accounts by levels of risk, sought clarity on whether the governments or insurgents were in control of those countries' central banks, the official said. A State Department official said it  maintains contact with counterparts in the Federal Reserve system to share information on political and security developments  so they can  better evaluate and understand foreign governmental structures, leadership, and financial risk.  Representatives of Libya's and Yemen's central banks, as well as Yemen's embassy in Washington, did not respond to requests for comment.

It also comes as U.S. intelligence-gathering has come under intense public scrutiny, with agencies investigating Russian meddling in last year's election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign. The Senate this month backed new sanctions on Russia in part to punish it for the meddling, while the Treasury added individuals and entities to those sanctioned over Moscow's actions in Ukraine. According to a draft account agreement the New York Fed published online last year, the Treasury or any other U.S. government agency or Fed bank must have  a need to know such information  to access it. Seven people with direct knowledge of instances in which this exception was used told Reuters there was no working definition of the  need to know,  and that New York Fed lawyers would usually decide case by case. The level of scrutiny by U.S. authorities and lack of clarity over what would constitute a  need to know  surprised some former foreign central bankers who spoke to Reuters. The Bank of France, which also maintains foreign accounts, guarantees  full confidentiality  for its clients unless information is needed in a criminal investigation, said Christian Noyer, who was governor from 2003 to 2015.  It's only in that case,  he said in an interview.  It's not just to look at them and to know that.  Less surprising was the fact that the United States leveraged the Fed's position at the center of global finance, they said.  The kinds of powerful central banks that can offer these services ... will want to use that power in ways that benefit their public remit,  Patrick Honohan, governor of the Central Bank of Ireland from 2009 to 2015, told Reuters. Edwin Truman, who headed the Fed Board of Governors' international finance division for more than two decades before joining the Treasury in 1998, said the Fed's clients should not expect absolute secrecy.  There is no promise to clients that the information in their accounts will not be shared with U.S. official circles,  Truman, now a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview. A Treasury spokesman said the department monitors transactions and collects data from all financial firms  both routinely and in the course of investigations (and) has the ability to request information from banks beyond the 'need to know' provision.  He declined to comment on interactions with the New York Fed. Treasury Calling The U.S. officials interviewed by Reuters included executives and division heads, and people directly involved in discussions in which the confidentiality exception was used to analyze accounts that otherwise only a select group of Fed officials monitors. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity. Day to day, a team of about a dozen New York Fed analysts oversees the accounts. This low-profile unit, called Central Bank and International Account Services (CBIAS), came under the spotlight last year when it transferred $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account into the hands of hackers in one of the largest cyber heists ever. The unit manages mostly Treasury and agency debt. It also oversees more than 500,000 gold bars that have accumulated in underground vaults since the New York Fed first opened accounts for Britain and France a century ago. The requests for information became more frequent after the passage of the 2001 U.S. Patriot Act, mostly from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a Treasury division enforcing sanctions and targeting terrorist financing, money laundering, and weapons and drugs trafficking. The Department can also subpoena confidential information. Among the requests since then have been inquiries about the accounts belonging to Turkey, Iraq, Russia and others, often to help determine whether official funds were being used to finance sanctioned groups or individuals, according to three of the sources. A few countries of keen interest to the U.S. government have little or no funds at the New York Fed - such as Iran, which is sanctioned, and Saudi Arabia, which is not. An official at Turkey's central bank said  operations are routinely carried out according to a correspondent banking agreement with the New York Fed, which is the standard operational procedure in correspondent banking.  Iraq's central bank stands out among those subject to U.S. scrutiny because of the extent of cooperation between Baghdad and New York. Earlier this month, based on information and instructions from the Fed's foreign accounts team, the Central Bank of Iraq blacklisted a money exchange firm suspected of ties with Islamic State and Al Qaeda. The Al-Kawthar money exchange firm, from the town of Qaim near the Syrian border, had its assets frozen in the action. Fed officials rely on meetings and conference calls to advise the Iraqi central bank on how to track and freeze out local firms suspected of terrorist connections or of helping Iran bypass sanctions, an Iraq central bank official told Reuters.  We have direct contact with the foreign assets monitoring office in the Fed,  the official said. In freezing the assets of Al-Kawthar, Iraq's central bank followed Fed  verification procedures,  added the official, who declined to be named. The U.S. Treasury announced the sanctions against Al-Kawthar on June 15, citing $2.5 million in money transfers it allegedly made to a firm linked to Islamic State facilitators. The owner of the money exchange firm was not available to comment. Sometimes, a peek into the Fed accounts has provided the Treasury insight into market upheaval. At the height of the global financial crisis in 2008, Treasury officials asked the New York Fed whether one of its clients was behind plummeting demand for short-term debt of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to a former CBIAS official. An analysis of the accounts showed that China's central bank had curbed purchases, and that intelligence factored into the U.S. government's decision to seize the agencies in September 2008, the person said. The People's Bank of China declined to comment. In some cases, the Fed team handling the foreign accounts would activate the  need to know  clause if it spotted something unusual, two former Fed officials said. Since the 2010 Arab Spring uprisings, for example, the New York Fed has made several inquiries with the State Department about Yemeni and Libyan assets, according to one of these officials. The Fed team, which ranks accounts by levels of risk, sought clarity on whether the governments or insurgents were in control of those countries' central banks, the official said. A State Department official said it  maintains contact with counterparts in the Federal Reserve system to share information on political and security developments  so they can  better evaluate and understand foreign governmental structures, leadership, and financial risk.  Representatives of Libya's and Yemen's central banks, as well as Yemen's embassy in Washington, did not respond to requests for comment.

An agreement on the post-Brexit rights of EU nationals is one of the easier issues for the two sides to agree on, with both Britain and the rest of the bloc wanting to provide assurances to millions of their citizens living abroad. But the British proposal says that once Britain leaves the EU, the EU's top court, the Court of Justice of the European Union, would no longer have jurisdiction in the United Kingdom in cases involving EU citizens. This is problematic for the EU, because EU citizens in Britain, who now can appeal decisions of British courts to the European Court of Justice, would lose that right with Brexit, meaning they would be worse off than now. Some EU officials welcomed some elements of the proposal.  At first glance, there is at least one element which makes a difference - namely the commitment to simplify the existing administrative procedures,  the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, said.  However, a number of limitations remain worrisome and will have to be carefully assessed,  he said in a statement.  The European Parliament will act to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK and defend the integrity of European Union law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its enforcement framework,  he added.

Below are the proposed new guidelines: - Until Britain leaves the European Union, EU citizens living in the UK will continue to enjoy the rights they have under EU Treaties.  - Once Britain has left the EU, it will create new rights in UK law for qualifying EU citizens resident in the country before the departure. The Court of Justice of the European Union will not have jurisdiction in the UK. - Qualifying EU citizens will have to apply for residence status. The administrative process will be modernized and the application process will be a separate legal scheme, in UK law. - Qualifying individuals will be granted 'settled status' in UK law, or indefinite leave to remain. This means they will be free to reside in any capacity, to access public funds and services and to apply for British citizenship. - To qualify, an EU citizen must have been resident in the UK before a specified date and must have completed a period of five years' continuous residence in the UK before applying for settled status, at which point they must still be resident. - Those EU citizens who became resident before the specified date but who have not accrued five years' continuous residence at the time of the UK's exit will be able to apply for temporary status in order to remain resident in the UK until they have accumulated five years. After five years they will be eligible to apply for settled status. - Those EU citizens who arrived after the specified date will be allowed to remain in the UK for at least a temporary period and may become eligible to settle permanently depending on their circumstances.  - Family dependants who join a qualifying EU citizen in the UK before the UK's exit will be able to apply for settled status after five years.  - Those joining after the exit will be subject to the same rules as those joining British citizens or alternatively to the post-exit immigration arrangements for EU citizens who arrive after the specified date. - The 'specified date' will be no earlier than the 29 March 2017, the date the formal Article 50 process for exiting the EU was triggered, and no later than the date of the UK's withdrawal from the EU.   -  The Government says it is considering a range of options as to how EU migration will work for new arrivals post-exit and will publish proposals in the future to allow businesses and individuals enough time to prepare. - Britain will discuss similar arrangements with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) States) on a reciprocal basis.

An agreement on the post-Brexit rights of EU nationals is one of the easier issues for the two sides to settle, with both Britain and the rest of the bloc wanting to provide assurances to millions of their citizens living abroad. But the EU's top negotiator Michel Barnier said Britain needed  more ambition, clarity and guarantees  in its position.

Reflecting the complexity of family relationships born of more than 40 years of EU membership, some lawmakers demanded clarity on what the changes meant for EU citizens' family members and spouses from non-EU states. And a major sticking point, which Brexit minister David Davis said at the weekend would be the row of the summer, was that Britain would not defer to rulings from the European Court of Justice - an institution the EU says must be involved.  I want to completely reassure people that under these plans, no EU citizen currently in the UK lawfully will be asked to leave at the point the UK leaves the EU. We want you to stay,  she told a rowdy session of parliament, adding some detail to a proposal made to Brussels on Friday.   I believe it is a generous offer.  May made her pitch just hours after winning a deal to prop up her minority government with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, necessary to give her a better chance of passing laws to ease the path of Brexit during two years of talks.     Related CoverageFactbox: Britain sets out post-Brexit plans for EU citizensEU gives cool reception to British offer on citizens rightsBut her authority is weakened and her strategy for Brexit is openly challenged both inside and outside her party, after she lost her parliamentary majority in an election she did not have to hold. The EU is determined to press home its advantage.  Mandate in Tatters  Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain's main opposition Labour Party, said May's reduced stature after losing her majority in the June 8 election, meant that she could no longer wring out a good deal for Britain from the EU.  She wanted a landslide and she lost her majority. Now her mandate is in tatters, but the prime minister still insists  she's the best person to get a good deal for Britain,  he said to loud cheers from his party.  The truth is this country needs a new approach to Brexit.   The 15-page document giving a point-by-point explanation of the proposals said Britain would allow current immigrants from the EU to retain healthcare, work rights and other benefits that are more generous than those given to migrants from elsewhere. It said those who had lived in Britain for five years by an as yet unspecified cut-off point could acquire  settled status , similar to permanent residency. Those more recently arrived would be allowed to stay until they achieved this status. But  settled status would generally be lost if a person was absent from the UK for more than two years, unless they have strong ties here , the government added.  Asked about how much it would cost EU citizens to establish their residency status in Britain, May's spokesman said:  As a general principle (we) are looking to recover what is spent on the immigration system but we want the fee to be a very reasonable one.  The government currently charges almost $3,000 per person to apply for permanent residence. Monday's presentation offered more details of a proposal May brought to an EU summit last week, an offer which European Council President Donald Tusk said fell short of expectations and could water down citizens' rights. Some commentators say May, who was once interior minister and in control of immigration policies, should have made her offer shortly after Britain voted to leave the European Union or at the latest after she triggered Article 50 of the EU treaty to start the process of leaving the bloc. That, former government official and professor of Economics and Public Policy at King's College London Jonathan Portes said, could have won her some goodwill in talks on a future trading relationship which could make or break thousands of businesses on both sides of the Channel. The EU has said before tackling trade and their future relationship that there needs to be  significant progress  on EU priorities, including its demand that Britain settle a  Brexit bill  and the rights of expatriate citizens. May's spokesman was upbeat, saying the prime minister was confident of getting a good deal with the EU.  It is the start of a negotiation,  he said, responding to criticism of the rights' offer from the EU.  We believe we have made a fair offer.

The Outlooks of the Long-Term IDRs and National rating remain Negative. Fitch also affirmed BNDES's Support Rating (SR) at '3', Support Rating Floor (SRF) at 'BB' and long-term National rating at 'AA+(bra)'. A full list of the rating actions can be found at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS The affirmation of BNDES's IDRs reflect Fitch's view that the bank would receive support from the federal government, should the need arise. BNDES's IDRs are driven by sovereign support and are aligned with Brazil's sovereign ratings. This reflects the full federal government ownership and its key policy role in the implementation of government economic policies. Fitch considers BNDES a public-mission bank and does therefore not assign a Viability rating. The Outlook on BNDES's Long-Term IDRs remains Negative, mirroring the Outlook of the sovereign ratings. Fitch believes that BNDES, similar to other public entities, remain subject to political influence given its state-owned nature and strong links with the government. BNDES's executive management generally undergoes changes following changes in the government. Most recently, in the second quarter of 2017, a new CEO was appointed following the resignation of the former CEO, who, in turn, had taken office in 2016 following the inauguration of the new government. BNDES has been subject to intensified public and political scrutiny in recent years, with respect to alleged irregularities in a number of its lending and investment operations in Brazil and abroad. As of the publication date of this release, an official investigation of its subsidiary BNDES Participacoes S.A.'s (BNDESPAR) operations with J&F; Investimentos S.A., the holding company of JBS S.A., was ongoing. In May 2017, a parliamentary commission was created for the same purpose. An earlier parliamentary commission was concluded in February 2016 without identifying any misconduct. BNDES has historically been Brazil's main lender of long-term credit at preferential rates. However, Fitch expects BNDES's market share to gradually decline over the long term, as the bank will not be able to count on new low-cost funding from the National Treasury (Tesouro Nacional; TN) for loan growth, as per government policy changes in 2016. BNDES prepaid BRL100 billion of its debt to the TN at year-end 2016; this had only a minor effect on its funding structure. At March 2017, TN funds, excluding hybrid capital, were 52% of the bank's total liabilities, while funds from the Workers' Assistance Fund (Fundo de Amparo ao Trabalhador; FAT) corresponded to a further 30% (57% and 26%, respectively, in June 2016). Since 2015, lower demand for loans, tightening of underwriting standards and lower risk appetite jointly led to a continuous drop in BNDES's loan disbursements. In 2015 and 2016 total disbursements fell 28% and 35%, respectively, due to continued suppressed demand and offer of loans, despite a reduction in the pace of the decline in the third quarter of the year. The negative trend has persisted through May 2017. As a result, in first-quarter 2017 (1Q17) and 2016, loan growth was negative 3% (quarter-on-quarter) and 11% (annual), respectively. BNDES's loan quality indicators remain better than sector averages, despite the downward revision of internal borrower ratings and the subsequent increase in impaired loans and provisioning requirements in 2016. Further, since 3Q16, BNDES has been setting up loan loss reserves above the minimum requirements. The relatively low impairment ratios are partly explained by BNDES's loans to financial institutions for on-lending which made up 43% of total loans at March 2017. Impaired loans classified in the D-H range under the central bank's range and non-performing loans above 90 days stood at 3.8% and 2.1%, respectively, at March 2017 (3.6% and 2.4% in 2016). In the same period, chargeoffs remained very low at 0.4% of average gross loans (0.07% in 2016 and 2015, respectively), and reserve coverage of D-H loans and non-performing loans (NPLs) over 90 days stood at an adequate 67% and 122%, respectively (58% and 86% in 2016). BNDES's profitability has been declining since 2015 as a result of loan and securities impairment charges, and lower income from investments (either via dividends or the equity method), reflecting both the deterioration in the operating environment and the bank's revision of its reserve policy. Impairment charges reached 72% of pre-impairment operating income at March 2017 (62% and 54%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively). As a result, operating profit/risk weighted assets (RWAs) declined to an historically low 0.93% in the same period (1.40% and 1.47%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively). Fitch expects BNDES's profitability to remain modest over the next year, as loan impairment charges are likely to remain high and further loan rating reviews might be needed. Large single-name exposures both in the loan book and in the equity and investments holdings of BNDESPAR pose downside risks to earnings. In Fitch's view, BNDES's capitalization is adequate considering the expected continuation of modest loan growth and the adoption of a more conservative dividend policy. At March 2017 the bank's FCC ratio stood at a comfortable 14.39%, compared with an average of 10.10% between 2013 and 2015 and 13.51% in 2016. In 2016 a significant increase in the security revaluation reserves (from negative BRL12.3 billion at year-end 2015 to positive BRL7.2 billion at year-end 2016), the decline in RWAs and the fall in the dividend payout to 27% of net income (from an average of 105% between 2012 and 2015) boosted capitalization. In the same period, the recognition of impairments in the stock portfolio and their transfer from security revaluation reserves to the income statement explained about a quarter of the increase in these reserves. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The affirmation of BNDES's SRs at '3' reflects the moderate probability of sovereign support. Fitch believes that the Brazilian government would have a high willingness to support BNDES in case of need; however, its capacity to do so has fallen in the recent past, as reflected in the successive sovereign rating downgrades in 2015 and 2016. BNDES's SRF is affirmed at 'BB' and aligned with the sovereign rating. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SENIOR and SUBORDINATED DEBT RATING The affirmation of BNDES's senior debt ratings at 'BB' reflects the affirmation of the bank's Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR, which is the anchor rating for the debt ratings. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS, SUPPORT RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING FLOORS, DEBT RATINGS Any changes in Brazil's sovereign ratings or in Fitch's evaluation of the government's willingness to provide support to BNDES, in case of need, would directly affect these banks' IDRs, National ratings, SRs, SRFs and debt ratings, all of which are driven by expected sovereign support. The National ratings of BNDES will not necessarily be downgraded in the case of a sovereign ratings downgrade. However, the Negative Outlook of the long-term National rating reflects that there could potentially be changes in the local relativities that, in turn, could lead to a downgrade of the National ratings, if the sovereign ratings are downgraded. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: --Long-term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'BB', Outlook Negative; --Short-term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'B'; --National long-term Rating at 'AA+(bra)', Outlook Negative; --National Short-term Rating at 'F1+(bra)'; --Support Rating at '3'; --Support Rating Floor at 'BB'; --Senior unsecured notes due 2019 and 2023 'BB'.

President Uhuru Kenyatta, the head of the Jubilee Party, is seeking a second and final five-year term in office in the Aug. 8 polls. Voters will choose a president, legislators and local representatives.  Public debates have focused on social services and the cost of living, although some voters will cleave to tribal allegiances. More than 1,200 people were killed after the 2007 polls when political protests unleashed ethnic violence. Kenyatta's chief rival, veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, is heading the National Super Alliance, a coalition of opposition parties that has yet to publish its manifesto. In its new policy pledges, Jubilee promised to provide free, quality primary healthcare for all Kenyans; free secondary education; affordable housing and connect every citizen to the electricity grid by 2020.  Kenyatta, the wealthy 55-year-old son of the country's first president, said he has slashed maternal mortality, overseen devolution, built new roads and opened a new Chinese-built railway linking the port of Mombasa to the capital Nairobi.   Employment creation is at the heart of the next Jubilee administration's priorities,  he wrote in a preface to the manifesto.  Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta arrives to the an event unveiling the Jubilee Party's manifesto in Nairobi, Kenya June 26, 2017.Baz RatnerReuters was not able to independently verify all the president's assertions, but maternal mortality has been falling in Kenya since 2003, and the Kenya Power Company said it has 6.1 million connections, up from 2.26 million in March 2013, just before Kenyatta took office. Many new roads have been built and the first phase of railway opened last month. The Kenyan economy grew at 5.8 percent last year, far outstripping the sub-Saharan average of 1.3 percent.  A young girl attends an event unveiling the Jubilee Party's manifesto in Nairobi, Kenya June 26, 2017.Baz RatnerBut challenges remain, the cost of living chief among them. Annual inflation was at 11.7 percent in May, the highest for five years. High prices and a regional drought have caused a national shortage of the staple maize flour.  How can we vote for this government when people's children are hungry?  asked mother-of-three and registered voter Mercy Indiazi.  Education standards also concerned her: Kenya introduced free primary education in 2003, but media reports about absent teachers, missing classroom materials and poor standards are also common.  The manifesto also highlighted advances in healthcare, although Kenyan doctors went on strike for four months, beginning last December, over poor pay and conditions.  Union officials said that doctors often had to conduct operations without basic equipment such as gloves. University professors have also mounted sporadic strikes over pay and conditions.

(BdB) at 'BB' and its long-term National rating at 'AA+(bra)'. Rating Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs and National rating remain Negative. Fitch also affirmed BdB's Viability Rating (VR) at 'bb-', Support Rating (SR) at '3', Support Rating Floor at 'BB'. A full list of rating actions can be found at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS The affirmation of BdB's IDRs reflect Fitch's view that the bank would receive support from the federal government, should the need arise. BdB's IDRs are driven by sovereign support and are aligned with Brazil's sovereign ratings. This reflects the majority federal government ownership, its key policy role in the implementation of government economic policies particularly through rural lending, and the bank's systemic importance. The Outlook on BdB' LT IDRs remain Negative, mirroring the outlook of the sovereign ratings. Fitch believes that BdB, similar to other public entities, remain subject to political influence given its state owned nature and strong links with the government. KEY RATING DRIVERS - VIABILITY RATING The affirmation of BdB's VR reflects the bank's asset quality, profitability and capitalization indicators that came under greater pressure than its large private sector peers during the 2015-2016 recession. While these are showing signs of improvement, downside risks to asset quality and consequently profitability remain, given the continued weaknesses in the operating environment. The VR also reflects the bank's strong franchise and stable funding. Under BdB's new strategy, the bank aims to attain higher profitability and stronger internal capital generation that will ensure its adherence to the fully implemented Basel III requirements without any need for external support by 2019. Fitch believes that the bank's targets now appear more feasible, in light of the measures taken in the past year. In first-quarter 2017 (1Q17), BdB's Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio improved to 10.9% (10.2% and 7.8% in 2016 and 2015, respectively), due to lower risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and a slight improvement in profitability. In the same period Common Equity Tier 1 ratio dropped slightly to 9.2% (9.6% and 8.2% in 2016 and 2015, respectively), due to the increase in regulatory deductions, as Basel III rules continue to be phased-in. BdB's asset quality indicators have come under pressure as the operating environment worsened significantly since 2014, which resulted in a sharp increase in the bank's loan impairment charges through 1Q17. At March 2017, BdB's non-performing loans (NPLs) as a percentage of gross loans rose to 3.9% (3.3% in 2016 and 2.2% in 2015), edging closer to its two large private competitors' average of 4.5%. The deterioration was mainly driven by loans to companies, while the increases in rural and individual lending were modest and NPLs remained relatively low. Fitch expects BdB's asset quality to remain under pressure, mainly from the corporate segment, as long as operating environment weaknesses persist and economic recovery remains slow. The still high concentration in the bank's large corporates loan book increases downside risks. In 2016 and 1Q17 BdB's operating profit improved, with operating profit/RWA increasing to 1.9% and 2.3%, respectively, up from 0.5% in 2015. However, pressure on earnings from high credit costs is likely to persist through 2017, although solid cost control and lower risk appetite should prevent a severe significant decline during this period. Potential large corporate defaults and/or debt restructurings are downside risks. BdB has leading franchises in multiple business segments, including lending, insurance, asset management and debit/credit cards. It is Brazil's largest bank in terms of assets and deposits. Its funding is diversified and retail-based. Customer deposits and local financial bills, which are very similar to deposits, made up 48% of total funding at March 2017. Locally, the bank is considered as a safe haven during times of crisis. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The affirmation of BdB's SRs at '3' reflects the moderate probability of sovereign support. Fitch believes that the Brazilian government would have a high willingness to support BdB in case of need; however, its capacity to do so has fallen in the recent past, as reflected in the successive sovereign rating downgrades in 2015 and 2016. BdB's SRF is affirmed at 'BB' and aligned with the sovereign rating. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SENIOR DEBT RATING The affirmation of BdB's senior debt ratings at 'BB' reflects the affirmation of the bank's LT Foreign Currency IDR, which is the anchor rating for the debt ratings. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS, SUPPORT RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING FLOORS, DEBT RATINGS Any changes in Brazil's sovereign ratings or in Fitch's evaluation of the government's willingness to provide support to BdB, in case of need, would directly affect these banks' IDRs, SRs, SRFs and debt ratings, all of which are driven by expected sovereign support. The National ratings of BdB will not necessarily be downgraded in the case of a sovereign ratings downgrade. However, the Negative Outlook of the LT National rating reflects that there could potentially be changes in the local relativities that, in turn, could lead to a downgrade of the National ratings, if the sovereign ratings are downgraded. RATING SENSITIVITIES - VIABILITY RATING BdB's VR would be negatively affected if asset quality deteriorates or profitability weakens more than expected, leading its FCC ratio to fall below 7% and/or its regulatory capital ratios to approach the minimum requirements earlier than Fitch's forecast. Fitch has taken the following rating actions: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at 'BB', Outlook Negative; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at 'B'; --National long-term rating affirmed at 'AA+(bra)', Outlook Negative; --National short-term rating affirmed at 'F1+(bra)'; --Support Rating affirmed at '3'; --Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB'; --Senior unsecured notes due 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2022 ratings affirmed at 'BB'; --Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb-'.

President Uhuru Kenyatta, the head of the Jubilee Party, is seeking a second and final five-year term in office in the Aug. 8 polls. Voters will choose a president, legislators and local representatives.  Public debates have focused on social services and the cost of living, although some voters will cleave to tribal allegiances. More than 1,200 people were killed after the 2007 polls when political protests unleashed ethnic violence. Kenyatta's chief rival, veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, is heading the National Super Alliance, a coalition of opposition parties that has yet to publish its manifesto. In its new policy pledges, Jubilee promised to provide free, quality primary healthcare for all Kenyans; free secondary education; affordable housing and connect every citizen to the electricity grid by 2020.  Kenyatta, the wealthy 55-year-old son of the country's first president, said he has slashed maternal mortality, overseen devolution, built new roads and opened a new Chinese-built railway linking the port of Mombasa to the capital Nairobi.   Employment creation is at the heart of the next Jubilee administration's priorities,  he wrote in a preface to the manifesto.  Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta arrives to the an event unveiling the Jubilee Party's manifesto in Nairobi, Kenya June 26, 2017.Baz RatnerReuters was not able to independently verify all the president's assertions, but maternal mortality has been falling in Kenya since 2003, and the Kenya Power Company said it has 6.1 million connections, up from 2.26 million in March 2013, just before Kenyatta took office. Many new roads have been built and the first phase of railway opened last month. The Kenyan economy grew at 5.8 percent last year, far outstripping the sub-Saharan average of 1.3 percent.  A young girl attends an event unveiling the Jubilee Party's manifesto in Nairobi, Kenya June 26, 2017.Baz RatnerBut challenges remain, the cost of living chief among them. Annual inflation was at 11.7 percent in May, the highest for five years. High prices and a regional drought have caused a national shortage of the staple maize flour.  How can we vote for this government when people's children are hungry?  asked mother-of-three and registered voter Mercy Indiazi.  Education standards also concerned her: Kenya introduced free primary education in 2003, but media reports about absent teachers, missing classroom materials and poor standards are also common.  The manifesto also highlighted advances in healthcare, although Kenyan doctors went on strike for four months, beginning last December, over poor pay and conditions.  Union officials said that doctors often had to conduct operations without basic equipment such as gloves. University professors have also mounted sporadic strikes over pay and conditions.

In a 5-5 split, a panel of 10 judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit effectively rejected a legal challenge by former radio talk show host Raymond Lucia, who had asked the court to review whether the SEC violated the U.S. Constitution when it appointed its administrative law judges. Monday's decision in the SEC's favor is at odds with the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which previously ruled that the SEC violated the Constitution in how its judges were appointed in a similar case. The SEC has since halted pending in-house trials involving defendants with appeal rights to the 10th Circuit until the legal issues can be resolved.  We look forward to the Supreme Court's resolution of the conflict between the D.C. Circuit and the Tenth Circuit,  said Gibson Dunn & Crutcher attorney Mark Perry, who argued the case for Lucia. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment. The SEC has faced mounting challenges in recent years to the constitutionality of how it appoints its in-house judges. At issue is whether administrative law judges are merely employees or  inferior officers  who wield significant decision-making authority covered by the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. The agency argues that administrative law judges are only employees because their decisions are not final and still subject to SEC review. But critics say they are inferior officers because they have the power to impose fines and bar people from the industry. Inferior officers under the Constitution must be appointed by the president, the head of a federal agency or by a court. Lucia, who was known for his  Buckets of Money  investment strategy, was sued by the SEC for fraud in 2012. SEC Administrative Law Judge Cameron Elliot found him liable the next year, barred him from the industry and ordered him to pay $300,000. Since then, Lucia has been appealing the case on the grounds that Elliot was improperly hired.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-sec-judges-idUSL1N1JN1EW"},

IS fighters will retreat through human smuggling networks to other countries. The group's illicit proceeds, which total tens of billions of dollars, are derived from plundering banks, siphoning and trafficking of black market oil, kidnapping for ransom, human trafficking, organ trafficking, and stolen antiquities, according to Western governments and analysts.  Financial institutions that aid, abet, or help facilitate the strategic withdrawal of assets and IS fighters will find themselves at risk of incurring historically large U.S. and European regulatory enforcement actions. Intercepting and reporting these activities will be the most significant counterterrorism priorities for global banking compliance, anti-money laundering (AML), and sanctions-screening programs in the second half of 2017 and 2018.  Background The Islamic State's rise to power was fueled by a confluence of events in Iraq and Syria that resulted in extreme sectarian violence and a breakdown in governance in large parts of both states. The Arab Spring movement, which saw popular uprisings overthrow authoritarian rulers in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt, also played a role by inspiring a similar revolt in Syria. The Syrian uprising, however, triggered a full-scale civil war whose chaos and influx of heavy weapons permitted the explosive resurgence of al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which later rebranded itself as the Islamic State. The group is designated by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist organization. Strategic Withdrawal of Islamic State Fighters In addition to the movement of financial assets, financial institutions must also be aware that IS's pending collapse will trigger the physical movement of thousands of Islamic State fighters through a complex series of human smuggling networks, ultimately leading to Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Algeria, Sudan, and Mali, among others. The vast majority of former IS members will likely defect to al Qaeda, as the perceived  winner  of modern Sunni militant groups. Most will likely join the Yemen-based affiliate known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), as well as the West-African counterpart called al Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).  The next sectarian Islamist battlefront is likely Yemen, which possesses significant geostrategic importance. AQAP has recently strengthened its position in Yemen, which in 2014 was plunged into chaos when Iranian-backed Houthi rebels deposed the country's Sunni-led regime, prompting a highly destructive and destabilizing Saudi-led bombing campaign a year later. Iran is concerned that AQAP's growing strength in Yemen could invite a Western invasion that would give U.S. forces control over both sides of the Gulf of Aden, thereby allowing it to choke off Iran's trade in energy and weapons.  Another group of IS militants likely intends to return to their homelands in Europe and the Caucasus region. These are hardcore IS loyalists who intend to carry out mass-casualty attacks on the West. New Terrorism Finance Paradigm AML compliance specialists should renew their thinking around modern terrorism financing. In 2017, militant organizations are not predominantly financed by third parties (apart from Hezbollah receiving funds from Iran). Instead, they are self-financed through their own criminal enterprises, and IS is no exception.  Senior IS leaders are highly educated and will launder illicit assets through outside individuals with legal, compliance, and accounting backgrounds. These individuals will likely understand the regulatory environment and know how to subvert conventional AML optimization strategy based on broad transaction actions and limited Know Your Customer (KYC) collection data-points. They may take advantage of the lack of integration between KYC and transaction-monitoring within banking compliance programs. Additionally, these facilitators will likely be well-versed in sanctions-screening evasion tactics. Expect significant use of real passports with fake names, which were purchased through bribery of corrupt officials in various diplomatic consulates. The laundering process will include shell, shelf, and seemingly legitimate front companies. Known IS leaders already named on the U.S Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List and other sanctions databases will likely not be listed on any accounts. Those names should, however, remain a high-risk concern with respect to beneficial ownership in KYC compliance programs.  Numerous banking products, from global to retail, will be affected by IS's likely strategic withdrawal. Financial institutions can minimize risk and focus on IS's financial outflow by mobilizing an optimization, rule-tuning, and development program that specifically targets emergent terrorism channels and typologies in their risk assessment, global threat landscape analysis, transaction-monitoring detection, and sanctions-screening methodology.  MOVEMENT STAGE 1: CASH TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE TO GLOBAL WIRES Initially, IS can be expected to execute bulk cash-smuggling through its elaborate Hawala informal money-transfer network, utilizing numerous couriers supported by expert smugglers along human smuggling networks. The cash will likely transit through currency exchanges in the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon, followed by channels of international wire transfers that make extensive use of free-trade zones.  Middle East and free-trade zone banks and currency exchanges with  check-the-box  compliance frameworks, as well as other firms with no interest in escalating illicit activity to regulatory agencies, could facilitate these transactions through willful ignorance or direct corrupt involvement.  Banks and money transmitters in countries including Turkey, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lebanon, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, Germany, and Sweden, among others, should be of particular concern. Movement Stage 2: Retail Banking Moving from global wires and currency exchanges to retail bank accounts, IS will likely make significant use of Western retail institutions, distributing wealth among major banks, credit unions, community banks, and credit card companies alike. Retail money laundering tradecraft could include false invoicing of products through online services, such as eBay or PayPal, and money transmitters, such as Western Union and MoneyGram.  Of additional concern is purchase activity related to precious metals, digital or blockchain currency, such as bitcoin, and of great significance: mobile applications. IS is staffed by many young, tech-savvy men who are well-versed in mobile technology and could make use of Facebook Payments, the  Cash  application, and others.  The general retail channels of movement by echelon, as with any global threat organization, will likely include movement from business checking to tactical-level checking, and then credit card accounts. Those accounts may be used to load open-loop, general-purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid cards through the use of manufactured spending and subversion of third-party payment processor (TPPP) reporting.  For example, CheckFree, a payment processor, cannot issue a suspicious activity report (SAR) for transactions under $2,000, and it does not require identification under $2,500. Their AML policies and procedures are posted online through open sources. Threat actors could use this information by executing transactions just under $2,000. Once prepaid cards are loaded, operatives could  bust-out  to cash anonymously in their new homeland. Individual Anonymity Tradecraft Banking compliance programs are greatly concerned when the source of funds in a bank account is unknown, as the source could be derived from illicit proceeds. Compliance programs should be even more concerned about patterns of activity that provide anonymity to the physical individual or company.  Some typologies that indicate  hiding in plain sight  feature KYC information with incorrect email addresses, use of P.O. boxes, and inoperable phone numbers. With respect to telecommunications, compliance staff should look for purchases of  burner  phones from prepaid phone providers, as well as searching the client's phone number against instant-messaging platforms, such as  WhatsApp,  which provides encrypted communication used frequently by terrorists and drug traffickers.  Transactions related to private browsing, encryption, and online video games, such as World of Warcraft, provide unconventional cover for covert communications. Expect to see these purchases on retail prepaid, credit, or checking accounts.  Other transactions potentially designed to provide personal anonymity include cash-intensive ATM deposits and withdrawals, the loading of open-loop, general-purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid cards, cyclical manufactured spending, technology purchases, and inter-state or international travel. Look for rental car transactions, as police officers cannot identify the individual by running the license plate of the vehicle. Pay special attention to false personal identification information, such as the  stacking  of Arabic titles in lieu of actual Arabic naming nomenclature. For example, a name that in English reads as  Son of Doctor Pastor Community Leader  would not look right, and it looks wrong in Arabic, as well. Arabic naming nomenclature includes stacked titles, but naming nomenclature must be present to be valid.  Look for individual or entity accounts linked to IS hotspots that are owned by a female, but with male names listed as beneficiaries. In many orthodox Sunni Islamic countries, women generally do not own bank accounts. A cultural awareness of Islamic societal norms in certain places is helpful in sorting anomalies from conventional practices.  Also look for Arabic-language naming nomenclature in places where ethnic Arab representation is demographically uncommon. This type of data point has been relevant in identifying other militant groups, such as Hezbollah. For example, Shiite-specific Arabic naming nomenclature associated with accounts belonging to business types known as high-risk for affiliation with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and Hezbollah have appeared in places like Venezuela and Paraguay, whose populations overwhelmingly carry Hispanic names.  From KYC and OFAC sanctions-screening perspectives, staff should pay special attention to  real-but-fraudulent  passports, with fake names, derived from corrupt government personnel that profit from the sale of passports. For IS fighters retreating from territories formerly under their control, passports are as important as weapons. In addition to genuine passports obtained through bribery, expect IS fighters to use counterfeit Belgian and French passports, which are relatively easy to fake, to facilitate travel throughout the Western world. Hybrid Threat Finance (Htf) Detection In terms of typologies, the current and future flow of IS funds will include hundreds of combinations of geographic-nexus wire channels (e.g. originating entity, originating bank, beneficiary bank, beneficiary entity), in tandem with complicated transaction-monitoring typology sets. It is critically important to understand and target these channels, typologies, financial-institution facilitators, and front-companies of concern.  Al Qaeda prefers to use non-profits and shell- or shelf companies, unlike Shiite militant group Hezbollah, which uses a trade-based money laundering (TBML) system employing seemingly legitimate front companies. Expect IS to have adapted its laundering tactics to accommodate both approaches. Detection scenarios should be created under the hybrid threat finance (HTF) targeting doctrine. The term  hybrid threat  is an intelligence and warfare targeting doctrinal concept that recognizes the intersection of hostile nation-state and non-nation state threat typologies.  The HTF doctrine isolates the movement of illicit funds through detection strategies based on threat typologies, organizations, and actual threat actors. This is in sharp contrast to conventional detection strategies that use red-flagging scenarios based on broad actions like ATM withdrawals, structuring, and flow-through-of-funds, which generate excessive false-positives. Threat organizations do not operate within the confines of broad actions. Additionally, firms should be wary of providers attempting to sell unsupervised machine-learning (UML) and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms that promise to identify threat-actors through abnormalities. Global threat organizations are skilled money launderers who layer proceeds in ways that often appear as normal business activity to the untrained eye. Such software is built by technology experts who may be unqualified on issues such as terrorism. Even so-called subject-matter experts (SMEs) who support the developers may lack the requisite background to identify the tradecraft of threat organizations.  Many AML program components can and should use UML/AI automation, but the detection of evolving and dynamic threat finance tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) is a complicated process that should be addressed by experienced intelligence professionals. There is no automated  magic bullet  that can detect terrorists through transaction-monitoring and risk assessments. Additionally, detection strategies must be custom-built to the global geographic nexus and product offerings of each specific financial institution. Conclusion Financial institutions must ensure they do not facilitate the withdrawal of IS fighters and financial assets. Successful implementation of an  actor-centric  hybrid threat finance (HTF) detection strategy will help prevent regulatory enforcement, negative media, and the proliferation of Sunni fighters to the next battlefront.

Brent crude futures settled up 29 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $45.83 a barrel. The benchmark was still set to end the first half of the year down nearly 20 percent.  U.S. crude futures were up 37 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $43.38 a barrel.  I think it’s mostly bottom fishing at this point,  said John Kilduff,  partner with energy hedge fund Again Capital in New York, who noted there was some  book squaring  with the end of the quarter approaching.   After how much we’ve fallen, prices are attractive here as a result, so it’s not surprising that we're getting some buying, just on a valuation perspective.  In the week to June 20, investors in U.S. crude futures and options increased their short positions, or bets against rising prices.   On a speculative basis it’s arguably worth going long here and playing for a bounce,  Kilduff said.  The market is taking a breather here before we take a next move, which I think will be lower.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners have been trying to reduce a global crude glut with production cuts. OPEC states and 11 other exporters agreed in May to extend cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March. However, Nigeria and Libya, OPEC members exempt from the cuts, have raised output. Iran was allowed a small increase to recover market share lost under Western sanctions. It said its production has surpassed 3.8 million bpd and is expected to reach 4 million bpd by March. U.S. shale oil output is up around 10 percent since last year, with the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation at the  highest in more than three years.  “U.S. production could jump to 10, maybe 10.5 million barrels a day by the end of the year, and when you add Libya, Nigeria and North Sea production, that will negate the Saudi-led cuts,  said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.

The justices let stand a lower court's ruling that uniformly denying felons whose crimes were not serious the right to own guns violated the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, which protects the right to  keep and bear arms.  The case involved two Pennsylvania men who were convicted of non-violent crimes who challenged the ban. The Trump administration had appealed last year's ruling by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, calling it a threat to public safety. The 3rd Circuit ruling does not set a nationwide legal precedent. Liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have granted the appeal to hear the case. The Pennsylvania men who challenged the ban, Julio Suarez of Gettysburg and Daniel Binderup of Manheim, both were convicted of non-violent misdemeanors, but the crimes carried maximum possible sentences of more than two years, falling within the definition of felony in the federal gun ban. Neither Suarez nor Binderup served jail time. Binderup, who owns a plumbing business, pleaded guilty in 1998 of corrupting a minor after having a sexual affair with a 17-year-old female employee. Binderup was sentenced to three years of probation. Suarez was convicted in Maryland in 1990 of carrying a gun without a permit. Suarez was given a suspended jail sentence and a year of probation. Federal law generally prohibits firearm possession by individuals convicted of a crime punishable by a year or more in jail, the traditional definition of a felony. However, the law does not apply to offenses labeled as misdemeanors under state law that carry jail time of two years or less. In 2013 and 2014, the men separately sued to escape the felon gun-possession prohibition. Emphasizing their non-violent offenses and light sentences, they argued the law violates their right to keep and bear arms under the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in an 8-7 decision, held that people may challenge the ban depending on their particular criminal conviction, and found that it was unconstitutional as applied to the two men. Trump has strongly embraced the National Rifle Association but his administration in this case was on the same side as gun rights advocates including the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The administration said in court papers the appeals court ruling would force judges to make case-by-case assessments of the risks possession by convicted felons, a job for which they are ill-suited. The administration added that too many felons whose gun ownership rights were restored for various reasons have gone on to commit violent crimes. The Brady Center noted that the prohibition has been on the books in its current form since 1968, when Congress determined that the acquisition of firearms by people convicted of serious crimes posed a danger to public safety and to public figures.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-guns-felons-idUSL1N1JN0HZ"},

Loeb,Jan Bennink,Jean,Philippe Bertschy,Paul Bulcke,Ulf M. Schneider,Top 40,US,LOEB,NESTLE,United States","sector":"Business","content":"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. activist shareholder Third Point LLC has targeted Nestle (NESN.S) by taking a $3.5 billion stake in the food maker and urging Europe's most valuable company to boost returns as demand for its products weakens. Nestle shares jumped as much as 4.8 percent on Monday, touching a record high after Third Point disclosed its position  late on Sunday in a letter to the hedge fund's investors. In the letter, Third Point said it was urging the Swiss group to improve margins, buy back shares and get rid of non-core businesses, including its $27 billion stake in L'Oreal (OREP.PA). Third Point's 40 million shares - or 1.3 percent of the total - make it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. The $10 billion added to Nestle's market value on Monday showed that shareholders hoped the investment would spark change at a company which has a reputation for being slow-moving and insular.  Nestle has arguably been lackadaisical and complacent and underperformed its potential,  Bernstein analysts said.  It might now be stirred into action by an external force.   New York-based Third Point is an $18 billion hedge fund run by American billionaire Daniel Loeb. Loeb runs a multi-strategy portfolio though he is known as an aggressive, bare-knuckled shareholder activist who has taken on major companies such as Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and Japan's Sony Corp (6758.T).  Loeb and Nestle CEO Mark Schneider met in Switzerland earlier this month to discuss Third Point's ideas, according to a person familiar with the matter. Senior managers at Third Point, which started buying Nestle shares at the end of the first quarter, plan to meet again with Nestle leaders in the next few weeks, said the person, who wished to remain anonymous. Third Point's investment comes as Nestle and its packaged goods rivals grapple with slowing emerging markets, pressure on prices and consumers shifting from traditional brands toward healthier, fresher fare.  Related CoverageThird Point leans on Dutch turnaround expert for Nestle pushNestle has missed its long-term sales target for four straight years, but so far has eschewed radical moves like Danone's (DANO.PA) $12.5 billion purchase of WhiteWave or Reckitt Benckiser's (RB.L) $16.6 billion Mead Johnson deal.  The company has instead pushed slowly into healthcare, with a series of small investments and acquisitions that blur the boundaries of food and medicine. Nestle, which is based on the shores of Lake Geneva and  makes Nescafe coffee, Maggi noodles and Gerber baby food, said it was committed to its strategy under new Chief Executive Schneider, who joined from German healthcare group Fresenius (FREG.DE).  As always, we keep an open dialogue with all of our shareholders and we remain committed to executing our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value,  a Nestle spokesman said.  Beyond that, we have no specific comment.  One top-40 investor said Nestle has done a good job adapting over the years to a changing industry, selling its stake in eyecare company Alcon and buying pet food business Ralston Purina and Wyeth Nutrition. A Kitkat chocolate bar is pictured in the supermarket of Nestle headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland, February 16, 2017.Pierre Albouy The new CEO has been brought in with a mandate for change,  the investor said, pointing out that Schneider is Nestle's first external CEO hire in nearly a century.  We would prefer to let Schneider make his own decisions and judge him on the outcome than try to dictate what should happen.   Recurring Pressures        The move by Third Point cranks up pressure on Schneider, who arrived in January just before the sector was rocked by Kraft Heinz's (KHC.O) abortive $143 billion approach for Unilever (ULVR.L).  He has already been looking at ways to reignite growth. He has already scrapped the company's long-standing sales target and said it might sell its U.S. confectionery business, which includes brands such as Baby Ruth and Butterfinger. Nestle had a market value of $263 billion on Friday, making it the biggest traded company in Europe.  The consumer goods sector, home to usually reliable sales and dividends, has seen its share of investor activism in the past with mixed results. Before Nestle, the latest big bet was the $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble (PG.N) disclosed by Trian Partners in February. U.S. activist hedge funds have slowly cast their nets wider as corporate America becomes saturated with dissident shareholders seeking rapid changes to boost share prices.     We feel strongly that in order to succeed, Dr. Schneider will need to articulate a decisive and bold action plan that addresses the staid culture and tendency toward incrementalism that has typified the company's prior leadership and resulted in its long-term underperformance,  Third Point said in the letter. It argued that Nestle should sell its 23 percent stake in French cosmetics firm L'Oreal. Nestle shares closed 4.3 percent higher and L'Oreal shares rose 3.9 percent. The letter also said Nestle should set a formal profit margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020 to help improve productivity. Nestle's current margin is 15.3 percent, below Unilever's 16.4 percent but higher than Danone's 13.8 percent. Third Point also recommended Nestle more than double its debt load, as well as sell the L'Oreal stake, in order to generate the capital to buy back stock. Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said Third Point's suggestions echoed proposals long made by other shareholders.  Previous management was not too open to listen to critics,  he said.  Now with Mr. Schneider, one of his top priorities was to improve shareholder communication and investor relations. I think he's listening carefully to what investors are saying.  Nestle's previous CEO, Paul Bulcke, is now its chairman. Nestle will report half-year results on July 27 and host an investor meeting on Sept. 26. Its next annual meeting is April 12, 2018.

Eric Christopher Conn, 56, used a fake passport to flee to a country he did not identify, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader, which said it exchanged emails with a person it identified as Conn. The paper said on Sunday that person answered correctly questions only Conn would know. Scott White, Conn's attorney, could not be reached by Reuters for comment, but he told the newspaper that he also received emails from that same address, from a person he believed to be Conn. A federal court in Kentucky issued an arrest warrant for Conn on June 3, the day after officials said he violated conditions of his release by removing a GPS ankle monitor.  Conn pleaded guilty on March 24 to charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $600 million in federal disability payments for thousands of people. His sentencing is scheduled for July 14 and he faces up to 10 years in prison. Former Kentucky lawyer Eric Conn is seen in a photo taken in 2017 and released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  FBI/Handout via REUTERSThe guilty plea came almost a year after Conn, an attorney who advertised his services through the website MrSocialSecurity.com, was charged in April 2016 along with a retired administrative law judge and a psychologist. Prosecutors said that from 2004 to 2016, Conn, of Pikeville, Kentucky, participated in a scheme that involved submitting thousands of falsified medical documents to the U.S. Social Security Administration. After Conn fled, the Federal Bureau of Investigation posted a $20,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.  We are obtaining more evidence each day identifying how he fled, where he went, and who helped him escape,  said David Habich, a Kentucky spokesman for the FBI.  Conn surrendered his passport in April 2016 after being indicted, but an accomplice outside the United States obtained a fake passport for him, the newspaper reported. Conn did not identify the person who helped him, the paper said. In the emails to the Kentucky newspaper, the person claiming to be Conn said he fled because he felt it unfair that other defendants in the case received less jail time than himself. He also said he would not surrender without a guarantee he would not be charged with additional crimes for fleeing, the paper said.

They said Monday morning's wholesale beef price upswing and back-month futures' discounts to last week's cash prices offset initial selling tied to Friday's bearish U.S. Department of Agriculture monthly Cattle-On-Feed report.                               June        , which will expire on Friday, closed 2.275 cents per pound higher at 121.475 cents. Most actively traded  August         finished limit up at 118.275 cents, and topped its 10-day moving average of 116.960 cents.     CME live cattle's trading limit on Tuesday will be expanded to 4.500-cents following August's limit-down settlement on Monday.     Market participants await this week's sale of market-ready, or cash, cattle that a week ago brought $118 to $123 per cwt.     Packers are buying cattle for the U.S. July Fourth holiday-shortened workweek as beef demand tends to subside this time of year, said traders and analysts.     Wednesday's Fed Cattle Exchange sale of 2,554 animals could set the tone for remaining animals in the Plains. Last week, a small number of cattle at the exchange moved at $123 per cwt.     Buy stops, technical buying and live cattle futures advances drove nearby CME feeder cattle contracts up their 4.500-cent price limit. The limit will be expanded to 6.750 cents on Tuesday.     August feeders         ended limit up at 149.450 cents per pound.      HOGS FINISH FIRMER        CME lean hog futures' discount to the exchange's hog index for June 22 at 90.17 cents attracted buyers, said traders.     They said investors sold deferred months before Thursday's USDA quarterly hog report and bought July - driving it to a new high for the contract.     July         ended up 1.725 cents per pound to 87.025 cents, and marked a new high of 87.725 cents. August         closed up 0.025 cent to 78.675 cents.     Packers need fewer hogs before plants shut down during the holiday, which could reduce the amount of product available to retailers, a trader said.

Stocks were volatile on Wall Street, with technology going from top gainer to top decliner and defensive sectors emerging as the best performers. A massive trade in gold futures as Europe opened for trading dragged the contract to a six-week low. European shares rose the most in five sessions as banks rallied after Italy reached a deal to wind up two failed regional lenders. Nestle jumped after an activist investor urged changes at the world's largest food company. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.41 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.20 percent. Bank stocks rose after an agreement in which Italy's largest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, will take on the remaining good assets of collapsed Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. But across the Atlantic, new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 45.28 points, or 0.21 percent, to 21,440.04, the S&P; 500 gained 4.03 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,442.33 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.06 points, or 0.14 percent, to 6,256.19. Emerging market stocks rose 0.79 percent. The best performing sectors on the S&P; 500 were telecoms and utilities, so-called bond proxies because of their relative higher yield and lower volatility.  The bond market is signaling an economic slowing,  said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, pointing to a flatter yield curve.  That's why you're seeing defensive names (in stocks) like utilities do well because equity investors are buying more in line with what that bond market is saying.  Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell after the soft new capital goods orders data. The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve speakers including New York Fed President William Dudley have indicated further monetary policy tightening is likely even as economic data disappoints. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.1352 percent, from 2.144 percent late on Friday. The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds fell to 93.1 basis points, the flattest since late 2007. It was last at 94.1 basis points. The U.S. dollar fell against the euro after the weaker-than-expected data, but buyers came in support of the greenback after it hit a more than one-week low. The dollar index rose 0.19 percent, with the euro down 0.13 percent to $1.1177. The Japanese yen weakened 0.57 percent versus the greenback at 111.90 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2718, up 0.02 percent. U.S. crude rose 1.02 percent to $43.45 per barrel and Brent was last at $45.92, up 0.83 percent on the day. U.S. oil is still set for a near 20 percent drop in the first half of the year. Investors in U.S. crude futures and options increased their bets against any future further rise in prices, as the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation hit its highest in over three years. “U.S. production could jump to 10, maybe 10.5 million barrels a day by the end of the year, and when you add Libya, Nigeria and North Sea production that will negate the Saudi-led cuts,  said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. U.S. output has steadily grown to around 9.35 million barrels per day. The rise in supplies threatens efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners to reduce global oil inventories with production cuts. Gold tumbled to its lowest price in nearly six weeks as a large sell order hit sentiment on Monday, though losses were limited by political uncertainty around the world. The sale of 1.85 million ounces of gold and 5,000 ounces of silver in a short time was behind the fall in prices, said Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS in Switzerland. Spot gold dropped 1.2 percent to $1,241.94 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 1.05 percent to $1,243.20 an ounce. Copper rose 0.02 percent to $5,801.50 a tonne.

In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata faces tens of billions of dollars in costs and liabilities resulting from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits. Its airbag inflators have been linked to at least 16 deaths and 180 injuries around the world because they can rupture and send metal fragments flying.     TK Holdings, its U.S. operations, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware on Sunday with liabilities of $10 billion to $50 billion, while the Japanese parent filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court early on Monday. Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, said in a court affidavit that the company  faces insurmountable claims  relating to the recalls and owes billions of dollars to automakers. He disclosed that Takata has recalled, or expects to recall, by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide, including  more than 60 million in the United States. Takata's total liabilities stand at 1.7 trillion yen ($15 billion), Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd estimated.  Final liabilities would depend on the outcome of discussions with carmaker customers who have borne the bulk of the replacement costs, a lawyer for the company said. The filings open the door to the financial rescue by Key Safety Systems (KSS), a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS).  In a deal that took 16 months to hammer out, KSS agreed to take over Takata's viable operations, while the remaining operations will be reorganized to continue churning out millions of replacement airbag inflators, the two firms said.  The U.S. company would keep  substantially all  of Takata's 60,000 employees in 23 countries and maintain its factories in Japan. The agreement is meant to allow Takata to continue operating without interruptions and with minimal disruptions to its supply chain. Related CoverageWhat next for airbag maker Takata after bankruptcy filing? We believe taking these actions in Japan and the U.S. is the best way to address the ongoing costs and liabilities of the airbag inflator issues with certainty and in an organized manner,  Takata CEO Shigehisa Takada said in a statement. The remainder of Takata assets will be reorganized to produce replacement inflators, but it is not clear how long they will operate. Takata said it plans to continue building older model inflators for as long as five years at plants in China, Washington state and Mexico. It will not continue producing those inflators at a plant in Germany. Takata Corp. Chairman and CEO Shigehisa Takada bows as he attends a news conference after its decision to file for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo, Japan,  June 26, 2017.Toru HanaiCEO Takada said he and top management would resign  when the timing of the restructuring is set.  His family - which still has control of the 84-year-old company - likely would cease to be shareholders. Takata in February pleaded in a U.S. federal court to a felony charge as part of a $1-billion settlement that included compensation funds for automakers and victims of its faulty airbag inflators. The company expects to honor the terms of the agreement and pay the $850 million due for automaker compensation. Three former senior Takata executives were charged in January in a U.S. court with falsifying test results but have not made a court appearance. About two-thirds of 46.2 million recalled Takata inflators in the United States have not been fixed. In June 2016, federal regulators said inflators in 2001-2003 model Honda and Acura vehicles have up to a 50-percent chance of a dangerous airbag inflator rupture in a crash and urged owners to stop driving until repairs were made. The companies expect to seal definitive agreements for the sale in coming weeks and complete the twin bankruptcy processes in the first quarter of 2018.      Takata warned in bankruptcy documents that if it does not complete the restructuring by March and complete payments owed under the deal, the Justice Department could withdraw the plea agreement and seek higher penalties. Slideshow (3 Images)It also faces hundreds of lawsuits and claims in the United States, Mexico and Canada, including consumer protection lawsuits filed by three states and 100 personal injury and wrongful death claims. A judge in the U.S. Virgin Islands action had ordered Takata recently to pay $8 million into an escrow account but the payment has not been made, Takata said. Honda Motor Co (7267.T), Takata's biggest customer, said it had reached no final agreement with Takata on responsibilities for the recall. Honda said it would continue talks with the supplier but anticipated difficulties in recovering the bulk of its claims. Unprecedented Recalls Takata faces billions in lawsuits and recall-related costs to its clients, including Honda, BMW (BMWG.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and others, which have been paying recall costs to date. It also faces potential liabilities stemming from class action lawsuits in the United States, Canada and other countries. Industry sources have said that recall costs could climb to about $10 billion.     The ammonium nitrate compound used in the airbags was found to become volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat, causing the devices to explode.     Costs so far have pushed the company into the red for three years, and it has been forced to sell subsidiaries to pay fines and other liabilities.    Founded as a textiles company in 1933, Takata began producing airbags in 1987 and at its peak became the world's No.2 producer of the safety products. It also produces one-third of all seatbelts used in vehicles sold globally, along with other components. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said its shares would be delisted on July 27. The stock has collapsed 95 percent since January 2014.

The state owns about 66 percent of listed Bankia, the fourth largest Spanish bank, and 65 percent of smaller lender BMN and plans to privatize them both before December 2019.

Nestle shares jumped as much as 4.8 percent on Monday, touching a record high after Third Point disclosed its position late on Sunday in a letter to the hedge fund's investors. In the letter, Third Point said it was urging the Swiss group to improve margins, buy back shares and get rid of non-core businesses, including its $27 billion stake in L'Oreal . Third Point's 40 million shares - or 1.3 percent of the total - make it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. The $10 billion added to Nestle's market value on Monday showed that shareholders hoped the investment would spark change at a company which has a reputation for being slow-moving and insular.  Nestle has arguably been lackadaisical and complacent and underperformed its potential,  Bernstein analysts said.  It might now be stirred into action by an external force.  New York-based Third Point is an $18 billion hedge fund run by American billionaire Daniel Loeb. Loeb runs a multi-strategy portfolio though he is known as an aggressive, bare-knuckled shareholder activist who has taken on major companies such as Yahoo Inc and Japan's Sony Corp. Loeb and Nestle CEO Mark Schneider met in Switzerland earlier this month to discuss Third Point's ideas, according to a person familiar with the matter. Senior managers at Third Point, which started buying Nestle shares at the end of the first quarter, plan to meet again with Nestle leaders in the next few weeks, said the person, who wished to remain anonymous. Third Point's investment comes as Nestle and its packaged goods rivals grapple with slowing emerging markets, pressure on prices and consumers shifting from traditional brands toward healthier, fresher fare. Nestle has missed its long-term sales target for four straight years, but so far has eschewed radical moves like Danone's $12.5 billion purchase of WhiteWave or Reckitt Benckiser's $16.6 billion Mead Johnson deal. The company has instead pushed slowly into healthcare, with a series of small investments and acquisitions that blur the boundaries of food and medicine. Nestle, which is based on the shores of Lake Geneva and makes Nescafe coffee, Maggi noodles and Gerber baby food, said it was committed to its strategy under new Chief Executive Schneider, who joined from German healthcare group Fresenius .  As always, we keep an open dialogue with all of our shareholders and we remain committed to executing our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value,  a Nestle spokesman said.  Beyond that, we have no specific comment.  One top-40 investor said Nestle has done a good job adapting over the years to a changing industry, selling its stake in eyecare company Alcon and buying pet food business Ralston Purina and Wyeth Nutrition.  The new CEO has been brought in with a mandate for change,  the investor said, pointing out that Schneider is Nestle's first external CEO hire in nearly a century.  We would prefer to let Schneider make his own decisions and judge him on the outcome than try to dictate what should happen.  Recurring Pressures The move by Third Point cranks up pressure on Schneider, who arrived in January just before the sector was rocked by Kraft Heinz's abortive $143 billion approach for Unilever . He has already been looking at ways to reignite growth. He has already scrapped the company's long-standing sales target and said it might sell its U.S. confectionery business, which includes brands such as Baby Ruth and Butterfinger. Nestle had a market value of $263 billion on Friday, making it the biggest traded company in Europe. The consumer goods sector, home to usually reliable sales and dividends, has seen its share of investor activism in the past with mixed results. Before Nestle, the latest big bet was the $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble disclosed by Trian Partners in February. U.S. activist hedge funds have slowly cast their nets wider as corporate America becomes saturated with dissident shareholders seeking rapid changes to boost share prices.  We feel strongly that in order to succeed, Dr. Schneider will need to articulate a decisive and bold action plan that addresses the staid culture and tendency towards incrementalism that has typified the company's prior leadership and resulted in its long-term underperformance,  Third Point said in the letter. It argued that Nestle should sell its 23 percent stake in French cosmetics firm L'Oreal. Nestle shares closed 4.3 percent higher and L'Oreal shares rose 3.9 percent. The letter also said Nestle should set a formal profit margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020 to help improve productivity. Nestle's current margin is 15.3 percent, below Unilever's 16.4 percent but higher than Danone's 13.8 percent. Third Point also recommended Nestle more than double its debt load, as well as sell the L'Oreal stake, in order to generate the capital to buy back stock. Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said Third Point's suggestions echoed proposals long made by other shareholders.  Previous management was not too open to listen to critics,  he said.  Now with Mr. Schneider, one of his top priorities was to improve shareholder communication and investor relations. I think he's listening carefully to what investors are saying.  Nestle's previous CEO, Paul Bulcke, is now its chairman. Nestle will report half-year results on July 27 and host an investor meeting on Sept. 26. Its next annual meeting is April 12, 2018.

It is the second consecutive year the funded ratio dropped by 4 percentage points, and the first year since 2010 that the aggregate funded ratio is below 70 percent, according to the report. The report studied the funding ratio, or ratio of pension assets to liabilities, of 131 state retirement systems. “U.S. stock performance was low in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016, while a strengthening U.S. dollar dampened already negative performance of non-U.S. dollar investments,” Ned McGuire, vice president and a member of the Pension Risk Solutions Group of Wilshire Consulting, said in a statement. In an interview, McGuire explained that 103 of the pension systems provided actuarial data for 2016. Wilshire used estimates for the remaining 28 systems, which only reported their data through 2015. For the 103 state retirement systems that reported actuarial data for 2016, pension assets and liabilities were $2.35 trillion and $3.53 trillion, respectively, the report said. Pension assets of the 103 systems decreased 1.8 percent in 2016 compared with the prior year, while liabilities grew 5.4 percent during the same period, the report said. Ninety-seven percent of the 103 systems that reported actuarial data for 2016 were underfunded, the report said.

The justices let stand a lower court's ruling that uniformly denying felons whose crimes were not serious the right to own guns violated the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, which protects the right to  keep and bear arms.   The case involved two Pennsylvania men who were convicted of non-violent crimes who challenged the ban. The Trump administration had appealed last year's ruling by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, calling it a threat to public safety. The 3rd Circuit ruling does not set a nationwide legal precedent. Liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have granted the appeal to hear the case. The Pennsylvania men who challenged the ban, Julio Suarez of Gettysburg and Daniel Binderup of Manheim, both were convicted of non-violent misdemeanors, but the crimes carried maximum possible sentences of more than two years, falling within the definition of felony in the federal gun ban. Neither Suarez nor Binderup served jail time. Binderup, who owns a plumbing business, pleaded guilty in 1998 of corrupting a minor after having a sexual affair with a 17-year-old female employee. Binderup was sentenced to three years of probation. Suarez was convicted in Maryland in 1990 of carrying a gun without a permit. Suarez was given a suspended jail sentence and a year of probation.  Federal law generally prohibits firearm possession by individuals convicted of a crime punishable by a year or more in jail, the traditional definition of a felony. However, the law does not apply to offenses labeled as misdemeanors under state law that carry jail time of two years or less. In 2013 and 2014, the men separately sued to escape the felon gun-possession prohibition. Emphasizing their non-violent offenses and light sentences, they argued the law violates their right to keep and bear arms under the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment.  The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in an 8-7 decision, held that people may challenge the ban depending on their particular criminal conviction, and found that it was unconstitutional as applied to the two men. Trump has strongly embraced the National Rifle Association but his administration in this case was on the same side as gun rights advocates including the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The administration said in court papers the appeals court ruling would force judges to make case-by-case assessments of the risks possession by convicted felons, a job for which they are ill-suited. The administration added that too many felons whose gun ownership rights were restored for various reasons have gone on to commit violent crimes.  The Brady Center noted that the prohibition has been on the books in its current form since 1968, when Congress determined that the acquisition of firearms by people convicted of serious crimes posed a danger to public safety and to public figures.

The Barclays Fortune 500 Equal Weighted Index will launch in July, tracking about 450 publicly traded companies with a combined revenue of more than $11 trillion, Dupe Adeyemo, a director at Barclays, told Reuters.  The index will exclude private companies, master limited partnerships and companies that do not meet liquidity requirements among the Fortune 500, Adeyemo said. Time, which like many of its publishing peers has been struggling as print circulation shrinks and advertisers shift to digital platforms, will aim to broaden its revenue with the partnership as index-based investing is increasing in popularity.  We're trying to be more creative about ways to expand our brand,  said Brian O'Keefe, deputy editor of Fortune magazine.  Frankly, this index should have been done a long time ago.  In addition to the magazine, the brand hosts conferences such as the  Most Powerful Women Summit  and is expanding online. Time declined to discuss the financial terms of the partnership. Revenue-weighted and profit-weighted indexes are planned for the fourth quarter this year, Adeyemo said. “We think a name like Fortune that resonates with the public … will distinguish ourselves among other ETFs that come out in the market,” Adeyemo said.  The Fortune 500 is an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks 500 of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue. It is unclear if Time Inc will be able to generate meaningful revenue by getting into the index business.   The licensing of indices is not a phenomenally lucrative business,  said Dave Nadig, chief executive officer of ETF.com, based in New York.  Time evaluated a sale earlier this year, but talks with     Meredith Corp failed when the two could not agree on price. Earlier this month, Time eliminated 300 positions or 4 percent of its workforce. Over the past 12 months, index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds pulled in $718 billion, while active funds bled $152 billion, according to the Thomson Reuters research service Lipper.

The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism  will formalize and structure existing and future areas of collaboration between our companies and foster cooperation with smaller tech companies, civil society groups and academics, governments and supra-national bodies such as the EU and the UN,  the companies said in a statement. The move comes on the heels of last week's call from European heads of state for tech firms to establish an industry forum and develop new technology and tools to improve the automatic detection and removal of extremist content. The political pressure on the companies has raised the prospect of new legislation at EU level, but so far only Germany has proposed a law fining social media networks up to 50 million euros ($56 million) if they fail to remove hateful postings quickly. The lower house of the German parliament is expected to vote on the law this week. The companies will seek to improve technical work such as a database created in December to share unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos of extremist content.

The neighborhood served as home and inspiration to generations of leading African Americans, including activists W.E.B. Du Bois and Malcolm X, who dubbed it  Seventh Heaven,  and artists such as poet Langston Hughes, and singers Harry Belafonte and Ella Fitzgerald. The appearance in real estate ads of the  SoHa  nickname, echoing the high-priced, largely white Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo in lower Manhattan, angered Harlem's U.S. Congressman Adriano Espaillat, who vowed to introduce a House resolution to protect Harlem from being renamed.  #WeRHarlem! And we refuse to be called by any other name! #NY13 #HarlemStrong,  @RepEspaillat wrote on Twitter on Monday. The tweet accompanied a photograph of the famed Apollo Theater, where Fitzgerald made her singing debut at age 17 on Amateur Night in 1934. Espaillat said the congressional resolution he plans to introduce this week  supports imposing limitations on the ability to change the name of a neighborhood based on economic gain.   I along with leaders and constituents of this community stand united to vigorously oppose the renaming Harlem in yet another sanctioned gentrification,  he said in an email.  This is an incredibly insulting attempt to disown Harlem's longtime residents, legacy, and culture.  Harlem is not the only historically black U.S. neighborhood to have its image challenged by eager real estate agents. Further north, parts of the South Bronx have been christened the  Piano District,  a reference to its former instrument manufacturing base. In Washington, D.C., real estate firms have recast the Shaw neighborhood around historically black Howard University as North End of Shaw. Both sparked outrage among long-time residents, particularly after developers who pushed the Piano District name change threw a  Bronx is Burning  themed Halloween party in 2015 that focused on the neighborhood's 1970s decay, complete with a bullet-riddled car sculpture. The  SoHa  name has begun appearing in real estate listings for apartments located between 110th Street and 125th Street and Realtor Keller Williams boasts a  SoHa Team  of agents on its website. Neither Keller Williams nor the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry association, immediately responded to requests for comment.

The slow-growing, high-dividend S&P; utilities and telecommunications were the best performers among the 11 S&P; sectors. Technology stocks, which have been under pressure as investors worry about stretched valuations, hit a session low in late afternoon trading.  The bond market is signaling an economic slowing,  said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  That's why you're seeing defensive names like utilities do well, because equity investors are buying more in line with what that bond market is saying.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 39.35 points, or 0.18 percent, to 21,434.11, the S&P; 500 gained 3.12 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,441.42 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.12 points, or 0.18 percent, to 6,254.13. A fall in Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet weighed most on the S&P; as well as the Nasdaq.  It's simply profit-taking going into the end of the quarter. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see that reversed in early July with the thought that we're going to see some strong earnings,  said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York. The utilities and the four-company  telecommunications services sector index were the S&P;'s best performers with gains of more than 0.8 percent. The S&P; energy was lower as investors worried about a relentless rise in U.S. supply and a surge in demand for short sale contracts, or bets against higher crude prices. The recent drop in oil prices has spurred concerns about low inflation, which remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target rate. The Fed raised rates this month for the second time this year and has indicated it could raise them again but futures imply only a 50 percent chance of another rate hike by December. The financial index rose 0.6 percent after a string of Fed policymakers appeared to back another rate hike this year despite a patch of recent weak economic data. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said the Fed needs to raise rates gradually or the economy runs the risk of overheating. New York Fed chief William Dudley said recent narrowing of credit spreads, record stock prices and falling bond yields could encourage the Fed to continue tightening U.S. policy. Data on Monday showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May, with non-defense orders excluding aircraft - a closely watched proxy for business spending plans - dropping 0.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 0.3 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.33-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter.                   The economic data has not been that great,  said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. At the same time,  people are looking for yield and the front-end is anchored.      Thirty-year bond yields             slipped to 2.68 percent, the lowest since Nov. 9.     The difference in yield between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                narrowed to as little as 93 basis points, producing the flattest yield curve since late 2007.     The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve officials including New York Fed President William Dudley indicated that further monetary policy tightening is likely.     That has led short- and intermediate-dated debt, which is more sensitive to interest rate changes, to underperform while long bonds have been supported by concerns about tepid growth and falling inflation.      Inflation is the key,  said Thomas Simons, a senior money market economist at Jefferies in New York.  Until oil moves meaningfully higher and people start to get convinced that inflation is going to come back, this curve flattening is going to continue.      Financial conditions have loosened in the past year despite the Fed raising interest rates three times since December, which is another reason to continue tightening, Dudley said in remarks published on Monday.                  San Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Monday that a recent slowdown in U.S. inflation was mainly due to one-off factors and should not prevent further increases in rates.                  Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak on Tuesday.     The Treasury sold $26 billion in two-year notes to strong demand on Monday, the first auction of $88 billion in new coupon-bearing debt supply this week.     The ratio of bids to the amount of two-year notes offered              was 3.03, which the strongest since November 2015.                  The notes sold at a high yield of 1.348 percent, which was the highest yield since October 2008.

The triple champion was comfortably leading an already eventful race when the headrest material worked loose, forcing him to pit for safety reasons and dropping him out of the podium places. Azerbaijan was the only round of the current calendar that the Briton, who finished fifth, had yet to win and the setback left him 14 points behind Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel. Without the headrest working loose, Hamilton would have been leading the championship after Vettel finished fourth following a penalty for banging wheels with his rival while following the safety car. Team boss Toto Wolff emphasized on Sunday that the team would not blame anybody for the error.

Mercedes recognized that the controversy thrown up by the clash between Vettel and Hamilton, which made headlines around the world and was the major talking point of the morning after, was good box office. The team added, however, that the weekend had also shown that the engineers were getting to grips with a car described as a 'diva' by Wolff after a bad Monaco weekend.

By a 3-0 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said minor league baseball falls  squarely  within the  business-of-baseball  antitrust exemption that the U.S. Supreme Court granted the sport in 1922.  The employment contracts of minor league players relate to the business of providing public baseball games for profit between clubs of professional baseball players,  Chief Judge Sidney Thomas wrote for the appeals court panel. Monday's decision is a defeat for four plaintiffs who played minor league baseball at some point between 2010 and 2012. They brought class-action claims accusing Major League Baseball and its 30 teams of suppressing wages, leaving most minor leaguers earning between $3,000 and $7,500 annually, and nothing during spring training. In contrast, the minimum salary for major leaguers is $535,000. Samuel Kornhauser, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients will likely ask the 9th Circuit to reconsider its decision, or appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Obviously, we think it's wrong, and that the 'business of baseball' is a lot different today than it was in 1922,  he said in an interview.  There is no reason minor leaguers should not have the right to negotiate for a competitive wage.  Matt Bourne, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, declined to comment. The players claimed that Major League Baseball exercised unwarranted control primarily through a  reserve clause  that lets teams retain players' rights for seven years. Thomas, however, said the U.S. Congress  has made clear its intent to maintain the baseball exemption for anything related to the employment of minor league players.  He said this in part reflected the 1998 passage of the Curt Flood Act, named for the former St. Louis Cardinals outfielder who unsuccessfully challenged Major League Baseball's reserve clause. Monday's decision upheld a Sept. 2015 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam in Oakland, California.

Borno police said a male suicide bomber killed a security guard after entering the University of Maiduguri, near the city center, on Sunday evening at 10:20 p.m. (5.20 p.m. ET).  Four female suicide bombers killed eight people around an hour later on the outskirts of the city in Zannari community, in the Gwange district of Jere local government authority after detonating devices in residential buildings.  Two female suicide bombers were the only people to die in two blasts at the University of Maiduguri on Monday morning at around 4:20 a.m. (0320 GMT).   In all, 16 persons including the suicide bombers died in the multiple explosions while 13 persons were injured,  said the Borno Police commissioner, Damian Chukwu. Nigeria's state security agency on Friday said it had foiled plans to detonate explosives in four northern cities - Maiduguri, Kano, Sokoto and Kaduna - during celebrations to mark the end of Islam's holy month of Ramadan. No group has claimed responsibility for the latest blasts in Maiduguri but the use of suicide bombers - particularly female attackers - in the region is a hallmark of Boko Haram.  The militant group, which has killed more than 20,000 people in Africa's most populous nation and forced more than two million to flee their homes since 2009, is trying to create an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria.  Nigeria's army, with the help of troops from neighboring countries, pushed the group out of most of a swathe of land around the size of Belgium which it controlled until early 2015. But suicide bombings and gun raids in mostly busy public areas, such as mosques and markets, have continued in northeast Nigeria and neighboring Cameroon and Niger.  The frequency of suicide bombings has increased in the last few weeks, although a large proportion of the attacks result in only the bombers being killed.

At least 93 people are missing after the landslide engulfed Xinmo village in mountainous Sichuan province as dawn broke on Saturday. Ten people have been confirmed dead.  Our house was somewhere around here but everything has been destroyed beyond recognition,  said a middle aged woman, one of a few residents who were away when disaster struck, after she pulled a green blanket she recognised out of the mud and rocks. The government has sent some 3,000 rescuers, along with heavy digging equipment, and has promised to do all it can to look for survivors. Heavy rain triggered the landslide, authorities have said. Some villagers said they've always known landslides are a big danger but authorities never offered to help them move. With danger of more landslides, authorities have been restricting access to the disaster zone, but hundreds of people were allowed back on Monday. Mournful wails and firecracker explosions echoed through Xinmo's steep valley as bereaved relatives returned, many clutching snacks and wrapped in plastic and bottles of wine as offerings for the dead. Some people burned paper money and lit incense which, along with setting off fireworks, are traditional acts of mourning.  Every single family has been impacted by the landslide, it's horrible,  said Sun Danxian, from a neighbouring village who was walking through the site. The government of Mao county, where the village is located, posted on Monday drone video footage of the area showing about dozen mechanical diggers shifting through a landscape of grey rocks. Relatives of victims react at the site of a landslide in the village of Xinmo, Mao County, Sichuan Province, China June 26, 2017.Aly Song'Lying for Three Days' Earlier on Monday, about 100 villagers, unhappy with what they said was limited information, met government officials at a nearby primary school, insisting they had to get to Xinmo. They also voiced fears about the possibility of rebuilding homes before winter and what would happened to orphans.  These government officials have been lying to us for three days,  a middle aged man from Xinmo, with several missing relatives told Reuters. He declined to give his name. Slideshow (14 Images) They told us we could go back yesterday morning but they kept delaying and delaying giving us all kinds of excuses. They told us a central government official was going to come to visit us. He showed up and didn't even bother to speak to us.  Another relative said the government should have moved them out of an area they knew was prone to landslides.  There have been landslides before but no one has ever suggested we move. The government knows it's dangerous to live in these kinds of villages and yet they do nothing,  said the elderly man, who also would not provide his name. The official China Daily cited Xu Qiang, a disaster expert at the Ministry of Land and Resources, as saying large-scale relocations in the area were difficult.  Many of the villagers have been living here for generations and have seen no major geological disasters,  Xu said.  This is their home and livelihood and it is very difficult to convince them to leave, specially when you only have a hypothesis and predictions.   Sichuan province is also prone to earthquakes, including an 8.0 magnitude tremor in central Sichuan's Wenchuan county in 2008 that killed nearly 70,000 people. Mao county is next to Wenchuan. State media said the mountainside that collapsed onto the village had been weakened by the 2008 earthquake. Most residents of the area are poor farmers of the Qiang ethnic minority and the area is the target of a poverty alleviation project, according to government officials.

After over two weeks of talks and turmoil sparked by May's failure to win a majority in a June 8 snap election, she now has the parliamentary numbers to pass a budget and a better chance of passing laws to take Britain out of the European Union. May and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster presided at the signing of a three-page so-called  confidence and supply  deal that is some way short of a more formal coalition agreement.  It means the DUP's 10 lawmakers will now vote in support of May's 318 Conservatives in the 650-seat parliament on the budget, legislative agenda, motions of confidence and Brexit. In return, May agreed to at least 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in extra funding over two years for Northern Ireland, agreeing to raise pensions annually by at least 2.5 percent and to keep universal winter fuel payments for the elderly.  I welcome this agreement, which will enable us to work together in the interest of the whole United Kingdom, give us the certainty we require as we embark on our departure from the European Union, and help us build a stronger and fairer society at home,  May said in a statement.  May linked her deal with an attempt to end Northern Ireland's political crisis by stipulating the money would only be released to a power-sharing executive in Belfast, raising pressure on the DUP to come to an agreement with their Catholic nationalist rivals. However a Conservative party spokesman said that there would be a mechanism for the money to be released via a consultative committee even without a deal to restore power-sharing. Related CoverageSinn Fein says Northern Ireland billion-pound windfall no guarantee of power-sharing dealDublin welcomes greater Northern Irish Brexit voice after DUP, May dealSinn Fein says DUP, May deal a 'blank cheque' for damaging Brexit The Conservative Party has recognized the case for higher funding in Northern Ireland given our unique history and circumstances over recent decades,  DUP leader Foster told reporters in Downing Street.  We welcome this new financial support of 1 billion pounds.  Leaders of Scotland and Wales voiced anger at the deal, saying it would weaken, not strengthen, the ties that bind the United Kingdom by  throwing money  at one of its devolved regions at the expense of others.  Today's deal represents a straight bung to keep a weak prime minister and a faltering government in office,  said Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones of the Labour party. Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:  In concluding this grubby, shameless deal, the Tories (Conservatives) have shown that they will stop at nothing to hold on to power – even sacrificing the very basic principles of devolution.  Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, shakes hands with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds, in Downing Street, in central London, Britain June 26, 2017.Neil hallGerry Adams, president of the Irish Catholic nationalist Sinn Fein party, said the deal provides a  blank cheque  for a Brexit that threatens peace in Northern Ireland. The deal with the DUP, which won 292,316 votes in the June 8 election, will run for the life of the current parliament due to end in 2022 but will be reviewed after each parliamentary session and most of the funding is due in the first two years. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn questioned how the government had found a billion pounds given planned spending cuts, which he said should now be canceled for all the United Kingdom, not just the province of Northern Ireland.  Even with DUP lawmakers onside, May's effective majority is slim and her position remains insecure though she has promised to extricate the Conservatives from what she termed the  mess  of the election. Slideshow (14 Images)Her strategy for a complete break of Britain from the EU is under scrutiny and her future as prime minister is the subject of public debate with speculation that she could be challenged from within her own party within months.  Fragile Peace in Northern Ireland  While May negotiated the DUP deal, senior Conservatives such as ex-Prime Minister John Major raised concerns the deal risks pitching the province back into turmoil by convincing  hard men  on both sides of the sectarian divide to return to violence. The fear was that increasing the influence of pro-British unionists over the British government could create the perception that London was no longer an honest broker of the peace settlement reached in 1998. The U.S.-brokered Good Friday agreement brought an end to three decades of violence in Northern Ireland that killed 3,600 people. Northern Ireland has been in crisis since Sinn Fein pulled out of its government in January, prompting an election in March and a series of missed deadlines to restore the compulsory coalition between Catholic nationalists and pro-British Protestant unionists.  I will be returning to Northern Ireland to continue our discussions as we attempt to re-establish the Northern Ireland Executive,  Foster said.  Now more than ever, political leaders, both locally and nationally, need to work together to find solutions for all the people we serve.   The latest deadline set by May's government for the parties in Northern Ireland to reach a deal is Thursday. Sinn Fein said the extra money for Northern Ireland would not in itself guarantee that power-sharing in the province would be restored by the new deadline.   Time is running short for the parties to come together and reach agreement to re-establish power-sharing,  May said.  Northern Ireland needs a functioning devolved government at this important time.

The triple champion was comfortably leading an already eventful race when the headrest material worked loose, forcing him to pit for safety reasons and dropping him out of the podium places. Azerbaijan was the only round of the current calendar that the Briton, who finished fifth, had yet to win and the setback left him 14 points behind Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel. Without the headrest working loose, Hamilton would have been leading the championship after Vettel finished fourth following a penalty for banging wheels with his rival while following the safety car. Team boss Toto Wolff emphasized on Sunday that the team would not blame anybody for the error.  This team has won three world championships and I will not point the finger at a single person,  the Austrian told reporters.

Calmly, working with facts rather than conjecture, we will put the finger in the wound... we will draw the right conclusions and improve.  Mercedes recognized that the controversy thrown up by the clash between Vettel and Hamilton, which made headlines around the world and was the major talking point of the morning after, was good box office. The team added, however, that the weekend had also shown that the engineers were getting to grips with a car described as a 'diva' by Wolff after a bad Monaco weekend.

Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller, along with several congressional committees, are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia used cyber attacks and fake media stories to help Republican Trump against his Democratic Party opponent, Hillary Clinton.  The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win... and did not want to 'rock the boat.' He didn't 'choke,' he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good,  he wrote on Twitter. Russia has denied meddling in the election and Trump has repeatedly called the investigations a witch hunt. In a Fox News interview broadcast on Sunday, Trump said he had learned that Obama had known about the Russia issue long before the election but that he  did nothing about it.    An official from Obama's White House, who spoke on condition of anonymity, rejected Trump's criticism and noted that Obama had raised the meddling issue directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The Obama administration's interest in making sure the response was bipartisan wasn't for the sake of being bipartisan. It was necessary because we needed the buy-in from state and local election administrators – many of whom were Republican partisans and/or skeptical of federal government,  the official said. The White House referred any questions about the Russia investigations to Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.  Representatives for Kasowitz did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Trump's latest statement.   With 4 months looking at Russia...they have zero  tapes  of T (Trump) people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology!  Trump said in another Twitter post on Monday. The Obama administration formally accused Russia in October of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 election. In December, Obama ordered intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention in the election and to deliver a report before he left office on Jan. 20. The intelligence agencies said in January they had concluded that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trump's favor, including by hacking into senior Democrats' emails and leaking them.  Following a weekend Washington Post report about the Obama administration's responses to the Russian matter, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, criticized the Obama administration on Sunday for not taking earlier and tougher action against Russia.

Spot gold        was down 0.9 percent at $1,244.82 an ounce by 2:22 p.m. EDT (1822 GMT), having dropped as far as $1,236.46, its lowest since May 17 and just above the 200-day moving average.      U.S. gold futures for August delivery         settled down 0.8 percent at $1,246.40, after making an $18 drop in heavy volume to $1,236.50 and then rebounding by $10, all within 60 seconds around 4 a.m. EDT (0800 GMT).     The sale of 18,500 lots of gold, totaling 1.85 million ounces, and 5,000 ounces of silver in 5,500 lots on COMEX in a short space of time was behind falling prices, said Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS in Switzerland.          Clearly somebody sold it by mistake and bought it back quickly, triggering stops below $1,250,  said MKS trader Bernard Sin.     UBS trader Joni Teves said the sudden drop in price was amplified by a lack of liquidity as some Asian markets were closed for a holiday while London was just opening.      Somebody's made a mistake there. Stops get hit as we go lower and the algorithmic programs that jump on the back of momentum moves exacerbate the move,  said David Govett, manager of precious metals and foreign exchange for Marex Spectron.      If it was a human error, they bought it back slowly over the day.      Looking more broadly, traders said gold was supported by geopolitical uncertainty related a bailout of Italian banks, the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump and Britain's negotiations to quit the European Union.       The world is in geopolitical chaos and gold is still good insurance,  said MKS's Sin.     Allegations of ties to Russia have cast a shadow over Trump's first five months in office while the British government's looming Brexit talks are also fueling concern about global stability.     In Italy, meanwhile, the banking industry remains saddled with 300 billion euros ($335 billion) of soured debts.                              Investors' lack of interest in gold can be seen at SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, where holdings dipped on Friday.               Elsewhere, silver        fell 0.5 percent to $16.60 an ounce and platinum        slipped by 1.1 percent to $915.95.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a boycott on Qatar three weeks ago, accusing it of backing militants - then issued an ultimatum, including demands that it shut down a Turkish military base in Doha. Qatar denies the allegations against it and says the demands are aimed at curbing its sovereignty. A government spokesman last week said Doha was reviewing the list of demands, but did not view them as reasonable or actionable. Gabriel told an event hosted by the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin that Germany remained in close touch with all sides to try to reduce tensions resulting from the biggest diplomatic crisis in the region in years.  He said some of the demands being made of Qatar were negotiable, but others clearly challenged its sovereignty. The Arab states are demanding, among other things, that Doha close Al Jazeera television, curb ties with Iran, shut a Turkish base and also pay reparations. Gabriel said it would be tough for Qatar to accept all 13 items on what he described as  a very provocative list . He said efforts were under way to define which conditions Qatar could accept, and which it viewed as problematic. Gabriel is due to meet Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Berlin on Tuesday. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has voiced support for Qatar in its confrontation with the four states. Qatar says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors' backing for authoritarian hereditary and military rules. Mainly Shi'ite Iran and Sunni Saudia Arabia have long been at loggerheads over religion and political influence in the Middle East.

ANZ Securities, it looked as though something remarkable was happening: Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to be on the verge of siding with plaintiffs in a case heavily lobbied by business groups.  The CalPERS case, as you probably recall, presented the question of whether the filing of a securities class action stops the clock on the three-year statute of repose for claims under the Securities Act. CalPERS contended (among other arguments) that once a company becomes a class action defendant, it’s on notice of its potential liability to every investor. So, according to CalPERS, defendants’ right of repose – the right to be free of unannounced exposure after a certain amount of time - is not violated when individual plaintiffs bring their own suits, even if those suits are filed more than three years after the supposed securities violation.  In oral arguments, the chief justice agreed that for defendants, repose means freedom from surprises. He also said it wasn’t clear to him that opt-outs from a securities class action would expose defendants to new liability. Those comments were sufficiently ambiguous to lead me to theorize that Chief Justice Roberts might turn out to be an unlikely plaintiffs’ savior in a big business case.  He wasn’t.  In a 5-4 ruling Monday, Justice Roberts and the other justices on the Supreme Court’s conservative wing ruled that the statute of repose is not tolled by the filing of a class action. Plain and simple, the decision means investors can’t wait more than three years to decide whether to stay in securities class actions, even though these cases typically take more than three years to resolve. To preserve a right to bring their own claims if they don’t like the class settlement, or if the class action falls apart, investors will have to file individual suits or motions to intervene with the three-year statute of repose.  CalPERS and a coalition of 75 institutional investors had argued that such a requirement would be a waste of time and money for them and for the courts, which would be flooded with suits and motions by investors filing protectively. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the court’s opinion, wasn’t swayed. The majority called investors’ concerns “overstated” and pointed out that there’s no evidence of a surge in filings at the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued the CalPERS ruling under Supreme Court review.  “Many individual class members may have no interest in protecting their right to litigate on an individual basis,” the opinion said. “Even assuming that they do, the process is unlikely to be as onerous as petitioner claims. A simple motion to intervene or request to be included as a named plaintiff in the class-action complaint may well suffice.”  As it did in its 2014 decision in CTS v. Waldburger, the court distinguished between statutes of repose and limitations. A statute of limitations, Justice Kennedy said, is equitable and gives leeway to plaintiffs who haven’t learned of violations. That’s why the Supreme Court held in 1974’s American Pipe v. Utah that the filing of a class action tolls the statute of limitations for all potential class members.  By contrast, Justice Kennedy explained, statutes of repose are supposed “to grant complete peace to defendants.” Statutes of repose can’t be tolled at all, the Supreme Court said, unless lawmakers specifically say the time limits apply only under particular circumstances. Nothing in the Securities Act, according to the opinion, suggests Congress intended to provide exceptions to the law’s “fixed bar against future liability,” Justice Kennedy wrote.  “To the contrary, the text, purpose, structure, and history of the statute all disclose the congressional purpose to offer defendants full and final security after three years,” the opinion said.  Given the chief justice’s comments at oral argument, I was wondering what the opinion had to say about the idea that class actions put defendants on notice of the entirety of their exposure. The dissent, written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, emphasized that point. But Judge Kennedy’s majority opinion – echoing ANZ counsel Paul Clement of Kirkland & Ellis in response to the chief justice’s questions on repose during oral argument - said the realities of securities litigation belie it.  “If the number and identity of individual suits, where they may be filed, and the litigation strategies they will use are unknown, a defendant cannot calculate its potential liability or set its own plans for litigation with much precision,” the opinion said. The initiation of separate individual suits may thus increase a defendant’s practical burdens. The emergence of individual suits, furthermore, may increase a defendant’s financial liability; for plaintiffs who opt out have considerable leverage and, as a result, may obtain outsized recoveries.”  There’s really not much room for interpretation of the Supreme Court’s decision. The only good news for plaintiffs' lawyers is that they may now get to represent investors filing protective individual suits and motions in securities class actions.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-securities-idUSKBN19H2A9"},

The result, though, may be an even more exclusive car, aimed at customers who consider Tesla's top of the range $130,000 Model S to be a little too run of the mill. Aston Martin will build only 155 of its RapidE, about a third of the initial plan, and lean more heavily on Formula One engineering specialist Williams after the withdrawal of Chinese TV and smartphone vendor LeEco, Palmer said. The setback and Aston's response underscore the challenges and risks niche carmakers face as they scramble to address future demand for electrification from consumers and regulators.  While the privately held Aston Martin brand benefits from the endorsement of fictitious spy James Bond, it lacks the backing of a large automotive parent that many rivals enjoy.  We've decided to make this car rare, which will obviously tend to push the price higher,  Palmer said.  Aston Martin now plans to proceed independently, funding further development of RapidE by ourselves.  Palmer agreed to be interviewed after sources told Reuters Aston Martin's partnership with LeEco had unraveled. Unveiling the alliance in February last year, LeEco and Aston pledged to launch an all-electric version of the Rapide S sedan in 2018. But the Chinese conglomerate has since slashed its electric car investments, including its U.S. startup Faraday Future's planned $1.3 billion factory in Nevada. Some Faraday suppliers, including seat maker Futuris and media provider Mill Group, have sued the company for non-payment, according to court records. FILE PHOTO: The Aston Martin logo is seen at a car repair workshop in Beijing, China June 19, 2017. Picture taken June 19, 2017.Thomas Peter/File PhotoSpokesmen for LeEco and Faraday did not respond to requests for comment on the end of the Aston partnership. Aston Martin declined to discuss its partner's business. $250,000 Price Tag Aston returned to profit in the first quarter, a decade after it was sold by Ford. Now owned by private equity groups Investindustrial and Kuwait's Investment Dar, the company is rolling out a new model each year under a taut recovery plan drawn up by Palmer, who joined from Nissan in 2014. Without LeEco's backing, the sports carmaker, based in Gaydon, Warwickshire, is pushing ahead as sole investor in the electric car, after paring down production and pushing back the launch date to 2019. The plan won board approval on June 21. Aston will start taking orders next month with 10 percent down payments on the RapidE, priced just shy of 200,000 pounds ($255,000) in its home market before incentives. That's a significant premium on the 150,000 pound entry ticket for its V12 model, whose 5.9-litre engine develops 470 horsepower. Batteries will come from a new production facility built by a consortium led by Williams Advanced Engineering, the F1 team's technical division, with matched British government funding. Williams, which supplies power packs to the Formula E electric car racing series, also built the RapidE prototype unveiled in 2015. Beyond the RapidE, Aston's first full-production battery car will be an electric version of the DBX crossover it is launching in 2019 - hoping for a repeat of the success that greeted its DB11 coupe, with a little help from the latest Bond film.  The RapidE project was always about learning in readiness for the DBX derivative,  Palmer said.  We can do that through a limited series.  Reporting by Laurence Frost and Paul Lienert.

Halep seemed poised to win her first grand slam title and become world number one when she led Latvian Ostapenko earlier this month, only to be buried under an avalanche of winners by the 20-year-old who claimed a shock 4-6 6-4 6-3 triumph. Many tears were shed after that defeat, her second in a French Open final after she was runner-up in 2014, but Halep said some time on the beach in Greece had helped her recover.  I had a few days home chilling, and then I have been on holiday four days. I came back and started to play tennis. I missed tennis,  she said. Good Spirits Halep certainly appeared to be in good spirits beside the English seaside on a warm sunny day and is already focusing on achieving the top ranking that just eluded her but which she could still claim before Wimbledon. If the Romanian wins the Eastbourne title, or goes two rounds further than Germany's current world number one Angelique Kerber, that would seal the deal for Halep.  Now that I'm so close, it's like it's coming more into my mind and into my soul,  Eastbourne wildcard Halep said.  I really want to get there.  But I'm close but still far. So I have just to take (it) match-by-match and do everything I can to be number one. It's going to be a big thing for me.  Asked if she would cope with the pressure better than Kerber, who is suffering a lean year, Halep had no doubt.  I want to face that challenge,  she said.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS AND NATIONAL RATINGS Banreservas' IDRs and National scale ratings reflect Fitch's expectations of the support the bank would receive from its sole shareholder, the Dominican government (IDR 'BB-'/Stable Outlook), if needed. The Stable Outlooks on Banreservas' Long-Term IDRs are in line with those of the sovereign. VR Banreservas' asset concentrations highly influence its Viability Rating (VR). The bank's VR also considers comparatively weaker capitalization, structural improvements in profitability and a stabilization of private sector loan quality. Even though loan quality indicators have stabilized in recent years, asset concentrations still highly influence Banreservas' VR. Exposure to a highly speculative-grade sovereign is high, though it has remained around 3.5x equity since 3Q16, compared with 4.4x at YE15. Private sector loan concentrations could lead to volatility in loan quality metrics due to a high level of restructured loans. Private sector loan quality ratios have been in line with peers since 2014 due to charge-offs, restructurings and private-sector loan growth. In Fitch's view, despite some deterioration since the last review, loan quality ratios are well within acceptable levels for the bank's rating category. Banreservas' capitalization is tight relative to its rating category, particularly when considering its high asset concentrations. Although the bank's regulatory capital ratio is well above the minimum required, at 7%, its tangible common equity ratio is one of the weakest among peers (emerging market commercial banks with highly speculative-grade ratings) which is expected to continue given moderate growth expectations and profitability. The bank's ROAA remains low compared with similarly rated peers. Fitch expects this ratio to stabilize between 1.3% and 1.5% as investments in technology and the expansion of its distribution channels continue to wind down. Banreservas has a strong franchise and has been a refuge bank in times of systemic stress. The bank has the largest deposit market share in the Dominican Republic (18% of the financial system). Despite high deposit concentration, its deposit base has been stable over time. Fitch views Banreservas' liquidity as adequate for its market. Cash and cash equivalents covered 24% of deposits and short-term funding. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The bank's systemic importance, its role collecting funds for the government's single treasury account to pay debt obligations, and its role as a provider of domestic loans results in an equalization of its Support Rating Floor (SRF) with the sovereign's LT IDR of 'BB-'. Additionally, Fitch believes the government's willingness to support Banreservas should it be required is substantial given its 100% stake in the bank. However, the Dominican Republic's speculative-grade rating limits the sovereign's capacity of support, resulting in a Support Rating (SR) of '4'. SUBORDINATED DEBT Banreservas' outstanding subordinated debt includes an international issuance of USD300 million due 2023 and a domestic issuance of DOP10 billion due 2024. The bank's subordinated note ratings are one notch below its supported IDR and Long-Term National rating, reflecting one notch for loss severity, but no notches for incremental non-performance risk relative to the bank's IDR. In Fitch's view, given the  gone concern  characteristics of the security, the anchor rating is the IDR, even though there is no explicit government guarantee on the security. Although these subordinated bonds are included in the bank's regulatory capital calculation, Fitch views these instruments as debt rather than capital. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND NATIONAL RATINGS The bank's IDRs and National ratings are sensitive to a change in Fitch's assumptions as to support. Changes in the IDRs are also contingent on sovereign rating actions. There is limited upside for the bank's national ratings. VR A material reduction in asset concentrations and a stronger capital base could lead to an upgrade of the bank's VR. An unexpected deterioration in loan quality or profitability or sustained high disbursements of income to the government that pressures Banreservas' tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio to below 5.5% could trigger a downgrade of its VR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The SR and SRF are potentially sensitive to any change in assumptions as to the propensity or ability of the Dominican government to provide timely support to the bank. This could arise in the event of a sovereign rating action. Currently, the Outlook on the Dominican Republic's LT Local and Foreign-Currency IDRs is Stable. . SUBORDINATED DEBT Banreservas' subordinated debt ratings are broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect the bank's IDR and LT National rating. Fitch has affirmed Banreservas' ratings as follows: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'BB-'; Outlook Stable; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'B'; --Viability Rating at 'b+'; --Support Rating at '4'; --Support Rating Floor at 'BB-'; --Long-term subordinated notes at 'B+' --Long-Term National rating at 'AA+(dom)'; Outlook Stable; --Short-Term National rating at 'F1+(dom)'; --National subordinated debt rating at 'AA(dom)'.

Store, which invests in single tenant properties, said Berkshire's National Indemnity Co unit spent $377.1 million on 18.62 million shares at $20.25 each, giving it a 9.8 percent stake. The stake was announced four days after Berkshire said it would invest up to C$400 million for a 38.4 percent equity stake in struggling Canadian lender Home Capital Corp and provide a C$2 billion credit line. Shares of Store were up $2.20, or 10.6 percent, at $22.97 in afternoon trading, likely reflecting Buffett's imprimatur. Christopher Volk, Store's chief executive, in an interview said the Berkshire investment was three years in the making, beginning with his 2014 email to Buffett, when the REIT was still private, to gauge his interest. He said Buffett responded within three hours, and put him in touch with a deputy, Ted Weschler.  Over the years, they followed every earnings release, every conference call, every presentation, every investor supplement, and became very familiar with the company and our investment strategy,  Volk said.  Then about 10 days ago, I got a call from Ted Weschler, and he said he would like to make an investment,  Volk added.  I was not expecting his call.  Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The investment makes it Store's third-largest investor, after Vanguard Group and Fidelity Management & Research. Store's portfolio includes more than 1,750 properties in 48 U.S. states, including such customers as AMC Entertainment and the second-largest Applebee's restaurant franchisee. Berkshire's other investments tied to real estate include HomeServices of America, the second-largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage, and Clayton Homes, which makes manufactured housing. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has more than 90  other business units.     Store shares had fallen as much as 27 percent after November's U.S. presidential election, a decline Volk attributed to worries about rising interest rates and the retail sector. But he said Store generates most revenue from the service and manufacturing sectors, and just 18 percent from retail.  The quality of the contracts we create is incredible, and the spreads between lease rates and the costs of our borrowings is our highest in memory,  Volk said.

The granite and bronze memorial was the latest Confederate monument to be targeted as U.S. cities remove the structures seen as reminders of slavery and the racism that underpinned it. St. Louis reached the agreement with the Missouri Civil War Museum and other groups after a lawsuit halted the city's effort to dismantle the 32-foot memorial earlier this month, according to the mayor's office. The museum will pay for the removal by June 30 and store it until a new location can be found at a museum, a battlefield or a cemetery that must be outside the city, according to a copy of the agreement. Workers were already taking apart the monument in the city's Forest Park on Monday, shortly after the settlement was announced, St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.  We wanted it down,  St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said at a live-streamed news conference on Monday, explaining that the structure symbolized slavery. The push to remove Confederate monuments accelerated after the 2015 murder of nine African-Americans by an avowed white supremacist at a South Carolina church sparked a national debate about symbols of racism. New Orleans recently dismantled the last of four Confederate statues that stood in the city, and Kentucky moved a Confederate monument from the University of Louisville campus to outside the city in Brandenburg, Kentucky. The St. Louis monument, located on the park's Confederate Drive, which may also be renamed, was dedicated in December 1914 by the Ladies' Confederate Monument Association, according to the website of Forest Park Forever, which partners with the city to maintain the park. It depicts The Angel of the Spirit of the Confederacy hovering above a bronze sculpture of a family sending a soldier off to war. It has been repeatedly vandalized with graffiti reading  Black Lives Matter  and  End Racism,  according to news reports, and the city has discussed removing it for several years. Patsy Limpus, who heads the United Daughters of the Confederacy Missouri Division and the St. Louis Confederate Monument Association, also party to the agreement, told the Post-Dispatch Monday that the monument helped residents learn from history.  Even though some people don't like, it is part of history,  she said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/missouri-monuments-idUSL1N1JN15V"},

(BdA). Fitch does not assign Viability ratings to the entity because of their development bank status. The Outlooks of the Long-Term IDRs and National Rating remain Negative. A full list of rating actions is provided at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS BdA's IDRs and SRFs are equalized with and linked to Brazil's sovereign ratings; thus the bank is rated at its SRF of 'BB'. The SRs of '3' reflect Fitch's view that the probability of support from the federal government is high, in case of need. The ratings also reflect the important and relatively stable funding source from shareholders and the important role that the bank plays in the implementation of government development policies in Brazil's northern region. The Outlook on BdA's Long-Term IDRs remains Negative, mirroring the Outlook of the sovereign ratings. Fitch believes that BdA, similar to other public entities, could be subject to political influence given its state-owned nature and strong links with the government. BdA is the sole manager of the Constitutional Fund of the North (FNO) and receives significant fee income to manage it. The fund's related fees will remain relevant to BdA's revenue, despite efforts to increase the bank's commercial orientation. FNO's revenue represents roughly 40% of BdA's operating revenue. As a development bank, profitability remains influenced by the government policies focusing on the development of the region. BdA's profitability historically is more volatile than the average for private sector banks, reflecting its intrinsic higher credit costs and lower margins, stemming partly from its public policy role. During the first quarter of 2017, the bank posted net losses of BRL55.6, mainly as a result of increased impairment charges. That was also the reason for a more modest profitability during 2016. Fitch expects asset-quality and credit costs to remain under pressure during 2017, but at a slower pace than the previous years, as most of BdA's credit exposures were already provisioned over 2016 and 2015. The result for 2017 is also expected to benefit from an increasing amount of recovery of past due loans after local Resolution 3.340 which grants better conditions and benefits for the refinancing of past-due debts of rural producers. This will be accounted for as recovery revenues, and should help the bank to revert the losses of the first quarter and contribute to reinforcement of its credit provisions. BdA's funding structure is less vulnerable to withdrawals given the bank is considered a safe haven in times of stress. As the economic scenario worsens, BdA benefits from a flight to quality in funding structure. Moreover, proceeds from FNO remain the largest funding source, accounting for around 55% of total funding in March 2017. Capitalization has been maintained adequately since the Tier 1 capital injection of BRL1 billion by the national treasury in 2014. Despite the more modest internal capital generation over the last two years, the lower amount of risk-weighted credit-assets from the deleveraging of its loan portfolio was enough to maintain regulatory ratios with adequate cushion as required under the minimum requirements. The risk of capital pressure could arise from a potential legal decision requiring BdA to provision the actuarial deficit of its proprietary pension plan for employees (CAPAF). If that is the case, BdA capitalization would still comply with the minimum Basel III rules, reaching 14% according to March 2017 data. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The affirmation of BdA's SRs at '3' reflects the moderate probability of sovereign support. Fitch believes that the Brazilian government would have a high willingness to support BdA in case of need; however, its capacity to do so has fallen in the recent past, as reflected in Fitch's successive sovereign rating downgrades in 2015 and 2016. BdA's SRF is affirmed at 'BB' and aligned with the sovereign rating. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS, SUPPORT RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING FLOORS Any changes in Brazil's sovereign ratings or in Fitch's evaluation of the government's willingness to provide support to BdA, in case of need, would directly affect these banks' IDRs, National ratings, SRs and SRFs, all of which are driven by expected sovereign support. The National Ratings of BdA will not necessarily be downgraded in the case of a sovereign ratings downgrade. However, the Negative Outlook of the long-term National Rating reflects that there could potentially be changes in the local relativities that, in turn, could lead to a downgrade of the National Ratings, if the sovereign ratings are downgraded. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Banco da Amazonia: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'BB', Outlook Negative; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'B'; --Long-term National rating at 'AA+(bra)', Outlook Negative; --Short-term National rating at 'F1+(bra)'; --Support Rating at '3'; --Support Rating Floor at 'BB'.

E-cigarette use, or vaping, was as least as strong a risk factor for smoking traditional cigarettes as having a parent or sibling who smokes or having a risk-taking and thrill-seeking personality, researchers found.  E-cigarette use among teens and young adults could increase the future burden of tobacco by creating a new generation of adult smokers who might have otherwise not begun smoking,  said lead study author Samir Soneji of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in New Hampshire.  Big tobacco companies, including Altria Group Inc, Lorillard Tobacco Co and Reynolds American Inc, are all developing e-cigarettes. The battery-powered devices feature a glowing tip and a heating element that turns liquid nicotine and other flavorings into a cloud of vapor that users inhale. Soneji and colleagues analyzed data from nine smaller studies with a total of 17,389 participants ages 14 to 30. They didn't examine why many teens and young adults transitioned from vaping to smoking traditional cigarettes, but both options contain nicotine, an addictive drug, Soneji said by email.  The habit of vaping may also make the transition to smoking seem more natural, and teens in particular may gravitate toward friends who smoke once they try vaping, Soneji said.   To the extent that e-cigarette use mimics the behavior of smoking a cigarette - handling the e-cigarette, the action of puffing, and the inhalation of smoke - it sets the adolescent up for easily transitioning to smoking,  Soneji said.  Like transitioning from driving a Tesla to driving a Chevy.  Seven studies looked at smoking initiation among more than 8,000 youngsters who had never smoked before. Data pooled from these studies showed that roughly 30 percent of e-cigarette users became smokers, compared with only about 8 percent of people who hadn't tried vaping. That translates into 3.6 times higher odds of smoking for people who have tried e-cigarettes, researchers report in JAMA Pediatrics.  One limitation of the study is that it included some results from earlier studies with a high drop-out rate, and it's not clear whether people who left these studies were different from participants who remained in ways that would make them more or less likely to smoke, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on the type of e-cigarettes used, and they only looked at U.S. studies. Even so, by pooling data from several smaller studies, the results offer stronger evidence that vaping can encourage young people to progress to smoking, said William Shadel, a researcher at RAND Corporation in Pittsburgh who wasn't involved in the current study.   The results are particularly compelling because the studies took into account other variables that put kids at risk of cigarette smoking, like alcohol use and peer cigarette smoking,  Shadel said by email.  These results should help to strengthen arguments for regulatory action that limits young people's access to e-cigarettes.  Enticing flavors of liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettes, like strawberry or chocolate, may make vaping appealing to some young people who might not like the taste of traditional cigarettes, said Dr. Brian Primack, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh who wasn't involved in the study. Peer pressure may then encourage them to graduate to smoking.   Young people report that there is a lot of pressure among e-cigarette only users to smoke a 'real' cigarette,  Primack said by email.  It may be somewhat analogous to the fact that teens who use flavored alcohol are often pressured socially to step up their game to harder forms of alcohol.  There's one clear way for young people to avoid this.  The biggest thing that people can do is never start using them in the first place,  Primack said.

The justices narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had completely blocked his March 6 executive order that Trump had said was needed to prevent terrorism in the United States, allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties such as family or business to the United States. [tmsnrt.rs/2seb3bb ] In a statement, Trump called the high court's action  a clear victory for our national security,  saying the justices allowed the travel suspension to become largely effective.  As president, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm. I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive,  Trump added. The lower courts that had blocked the order said it violated federal immigration law and was discriminatory against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution. Critics called it a  Muslim ban.  There were no noted dissents among the nine justices in the unsigned decision, although three of the conservative justices said they would have gone a step further by granting Trump's request to implement the bans fully while the legal battle continues. The court did not give Trump everything he wanted. His March 6 order called for a blanket 90-day ban on people from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees to enable the government to implement stronger vetting procedures. It was blocked by federal judges before going into effect on March 16 as planned. Both bans are now due to partly go into effect in 72 hours, based on a memorandum issued by the Trump administration on June 14.  The implementation of the executive order will be done professionally, with clear and sufficient public notice, particularly to potentially affected travelers, and in coordination with partners in the travel industry,  the Department of Homeland security said in a statement. The court said it would hear arguments in October on the lawfulness of one of Trump's signature policies in his first months as president The decision endorsed the Trump administration's contention that the president deserves greater deference from the courts on national security matters. Trump signed the order as a replacement for a Jan. 27 one issued a week after he became president that also was blocked by federal courts, but not before it caused chaos at airports and provoked numerous protests. The justices said that the travel ban will go into effect  with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.  That means people from the six countries and refugees with no such ties would be barred from entry. Trump's order embodied his  America First  nationalist message and reflected his views of the dangers posed to the United States by certain immigrants and visitors. There is likely to be further litigation over who is covered by the ban based on the Supreme Court action. Opponents of the executive order maintain that the court decision kept significant restrictions on the breadth of the travel ban because the vast majority of individuals seeking to come into the United States would have some sort of link to the United States.  It's going to be very important for us over this intervening period to make sure the government abides by the terms of the order and does not try to use it as a back door into implementing the full-scale Muslim ban that it's been seeking to implement throughout the presidency,  said Omar Jadwat of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents some of the challengers. Even before the Supreme Court action the ban applied only to new visa applicants, not people who already have visas or are U.S. permanent residents, known as green card holders. The executive order also made waivers available for a foreign national seeking to enter the United States to resume work or study, visit a spouse, child or parent who is a U.S. citizen, or for  significant business or professional obligations.  Refugees  in transit  and already approved would have been able to travel to the United States under the executive order. A Conservative Court The case is Trump's first major challenge at the Supreme Court, where he restored a 5-4 conservative majority with the appointment of Neil Gorsuch, who joined the bench in April. There are five Republican appointees on the court and four Democratic appointees. The four liberal justices were silent. Gorsuch was one of the three conservative justices who would have granted Trump's request to put the order completely into effect. Fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he warned that requiring officials to differentiate between foreigners who have connection to the U.S. and those who do not will prove unworkable.  Today's compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding - on peril of contempt - whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,  Thomas wrote. The court said that Trump's executive order distinguished between foreigners who have  some connection to this country  and those who do not, and said the government had committed to review cases for those with some connection to the United States on a case-by-case basis. The Supreme Court left the lower-court injunctions against the ban in place, but only with respect to the challengers to the ban themselves and others in similar circumstances, meaning they involve people in the United States who have relationships with foreign nationals abroad and whose rights might be affected if those foreigners were excluded from entry. Trump issued the order amid rising international concern about attacks carried out by Islamist militants like those in Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin and other cities. But critics have called the order a mean-spirited, intolerant and un-American   Muslim ban.  The state of Hawaii and a group of plaintiffs in Maryland represented by the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the order violated federal immigration law and the Constitution's First Amendment prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. Regional federal appeals courts in Virginia and California both upheld district judge injunctions blocking the order. The March order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original January ban, which also included Iraq among the nations targeted and a full ban on refugees from Syria. The revised order also jettisoned language that gave preferential status to persecuted religious minorities, which critics said could be taken as favoring Christians and other religious groups over Muslims.

An attempted fight-back by militants failed on Sunday night and Islamic State's grip on the city, once its de facto capital in Iraq, was weakened, a senior commander said.       Only a small part (of the militants) remains in the city, specifically the Old City,  Lieutenant General Abdul Ghani al-Assadi, commander of the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) in Mosul, told Reuters.  From a military perspective, Daesh (Islamic State) is finished,  Assadi said.  It has lost its fighting spirit and its balance. We are making calls to them to surrender or die.  As CTS units battled militants in the densely-populated maze of tiny streets of the Old City, which lies by the western bank of the Tigris river, Assadi said the area under Islamic State control in Mosul was now less than two sq kms. Mosul will fall  in very few days, God willing,  he added. Up to 350 militants are estimated by the Iraqi military to be besieged in the Old City, dug in among civilians in crumbling houses and making extensive use of booby traps, suicide bombers and sniper fire to slow down the advance of Iraqi troops. More than 50,000 civilians, about half the Old City's population, remain trapped behind Islamic State lines with little food, water or medicines, according to those who escaped. A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support in the eight-month-old offensive. The militants last week destroyed the historic Grand al-Nuri Mosque and its leaning minaret from which their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate spanning parts of Iraq and Syria three years ago. The mosque's grounds remain under the militants' control.   Iraqi troops captured the neighborhood of al-Faruq in the northwestern side of the Old City facing the mosque, the military said on Monday. An Islamic State armoured fighting vehicle destroyed by Iraqi security forces is seen on the road to West Mosul, Iraq, June 26, 2017.Marius BoschPushing East  Iraqi forces took the eastern side of Mosul from Islamic State in January, after 100 days of fighting, and started attacking the western side in February.  Assadi said Iraqi forces had linked up along al-Faruq, a main street bisecting the Old City, and would start pushing east, toward the river.  It will be the final episode,  he said. Aid organizations say Islamic State has stopped many civilians from leaving, using them as human shields. Hundreds of civilians fleeing the Old City have been killed in the past three weeks. Slideshow (5 Images)Islamic State has carried out sporadic suicide bombings in parts of Mosul using sleeper cells. It launched a wave of such attacks late on Sunday, trying to take control of a district west of the Old City, Hay al-Tanak, and the nearby Yarmuk neighborhood.  Assadi said an attempt by the militants to take over the neighborhoods had failed and they were now besieged in one or two pockets of Hay al-Tanak.  Security forces were searching the two neighborhoods house to house, as a curfew was still in force over parts of western Mosul, witnesses said. Social media carried posts showing black smoke and reports that it came from houses and cars set alight by the militants. Some of the residents who had fled the fighting returned to areas where the curfew was partially lifted, witnesses said. The authorities did not confirm a report on Mosul Eye, an anonymous blogger who supplied information on the city during the militants' rule, that 12 civilians had been killed in the attacks.   The fall of Mosul would mark the end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate , but Islamic State remains in control of large areas of both Iraq and Syria. Islamic State's Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is assumed to be hiding in the Iraqi-Syrian border area. There has been no confirmation of Russian reports over the past days that he has been killed. In Syria, the insurgents'  capital  Raqqa, is nearly encircled by a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition.

Key topics included global demand conditions, potential effects of Trump administration initiatives, and the impact of technological change on the industry and are discussed in today's special report  What Investors Want to Know: U.S. Autos (Sector Stable Despite Growth Headwinds).  Despite weaker demand conditions in many global markets, the rating outlook for the global auto industry remains stable. Most large global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have strong liquidity positions and relatively low leverage, putting them in a good position to ride out cyclical weakness. Global auto suppliers are also generally well positioned for a slower market, although the potential for leverage-increasing acquisitions could pressure certain suppliers' ratings. The migration toward electrified powertrains and the accelerating pace of autonomous vehicle research are driving radical changes in the global auto industry. OEMs and suppliers are competing with numerous startups and technology companies to dictate the terms of the potential upheaval in personal mobility. Traditional OEMs could lose relevance as the mobility landscape changes. As the auto industry evolves, Fitch is putting more emphasis on issuers' long-term positioning relative to these developing trends. Although the changing landscape is unlikely to have a direct effect on near-term ratings, a more rapid than expected shift in the competitive environment could change Fitch's views.

The European Union vowed to take over international leadership on climate after United States President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the Paris Agreement earlier this month. Talks to reach a deal among EU energy ministers dragged on for hours at a meeting in Luxembourg, with EU nations divided over those seeking more ambitious targets and those looking for more flexibility in calculating energy savings.  Not having an agreement today would have been a very bad signal in view of recent events in climate change policy,  the EU's energy commissioner, Miguel Arias Canete, said. The European Commission had proposed a binding overall 30 percent energy efficiency target and an annual savings target of 1.5 percent until 2030. The compromise, still opposed by Britain and some Central and Eastern European countries, removed the word  binding  from the text. FILE PHOTO: European Climate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete gestures as he addresses a news conference after the Paris climate deal, at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, December 14, 2015.Francois Lenoir/File Photo The compromise falls short of the level of ambition of the European Commission's proposal,  Canete added. Apart from any environmental benefits, the Commission's estimates that the 30 percent target would also create 400,000 jobs, increase European economic output by 70 billion euros ($78.30 billion) and reduce the continent's reliance on gas imports by 12 percent. The targets will be reached by improving insulation and the energy consumption of buildings, more efficient consumer goods and introducing advanced electricity meters. The Paris Agreement seeks to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to  well below  2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Energy savings such as the deployment of more efficient technology and building insulation could make up some 70 percent of the EU's goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the International Energy Agency estimated in 2015. Before becoming law, the EU proposals must be discussed with the European Parliament in the coming months.

The granite and bronze memorial was the latest Confederate monument to be targeted as U.S. cities remove the structures seen as reminders of slavery and the racism that underpinned it.  St. Louis reached the agreement with the Missouri Civil War Museum and other groups after a lawsuit halted the city's effort to dismantle the 32-foot memorial earlier this month, according to the mayor's office. The museum will pay for the removal by June 30 and store it until a new location can be found at a museum, a battlefield or a cemetery that must be outside the city, according to a copy of the agreement. Workers were already taking apart the monument in the city's Forest Park on Monday, shortly after the settlement was announced, St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.  We wanted it down,  St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said at a live-streamed news conference on Monday, explaining that the structure symbolized slavery. FILE PHOTO: Red paint is seen on a vandalized Confederate Memorial in Forest Park in St. Louis, Missouri in this photo from St. Louis' Mayor's office released on June 24, 2015.St. Louis Office of the Mayor/Handout viaThe push to remove Confederate monuments accelerated after the 2015 murder of nine African-Americans by an avowed white supremacist at a South Carolina church sparked a national debate about symbols of racism. New Orleans recently dismantled the last of four Confederate statues that stood in the city, and Kentucky moved a Confederate monument from the University of Louisville campus to outside the city in Brandenburg, Kentucky. The St. Louis monument, located on the park's Confederate Drive, which may also be renamed, was dedicated in December 1914 by the Ladies' Confederate Monument Association, according to the website of Forest Park Forever, which partners with the city to maintain the park. It depicts The Angel of the Spirit of the Confederacy hovering above a bronze sculpture of a family sending a soldier off to war. It has been repeatedly vandalized with graffiti reading  Black Lives Matter  and  End Racism,  according to news reports, and the city has discussed removing it for several years. Patsy Limpus, who heads the United Daughters of the Confederacy Missouri Division and the St. Louis Confederate Monument Association, also party to the agreement, told the Post-Dispatch Monday that the monument helped residents learn from history.

With his brother Thanasis, who plays for the Spanish club MoraBanc Andorra, the  Antetokounmbros  were in Athens for the launch of an Onassis Foundation college scholarship for children of migrants born in Greece, inspired by their path to success.  I was a young kid, 17 years old, and the Americans came and gave me a chance,  22-year-old Giannis said.  And I want to be that American for the kids here in Greece and Africa.  The brothers were born in Greece to Nigerian parents. As children they sold trinkets on the streets of Athens to get by. They were only granted Greek citizenship in 2013. Before an audience at Greece's Onassis Cultural Centre on Saturday, the brothers spoke candidly about their hardscrabble childhood and said they felt humbled and obligated to help others who grew up poor.  It's just unbelievable, how we started out when we were little, and we find ourselves here now and giving opportunities to kids. Who would have believed it?,  Giannis said. Giannis -- or the  Greek Freak  as he is known to basketball fans worldwide -- is the youngest player ever to star in an NBA All-Star game.

And we haven't changed, we are still the same because we had terrific parents, my mum and dad.

In the family's old neighborhood of Sepolia, the basketball court where the brothers practiced features a giant mural of Giannis in his Milwaukee Bucks jersey.  And in a cafe across the road, the jersey Giannis wore in 2014 when he played on Greece's national team hangs on the wall.  What they have accomplished is a feat  said Yannis Tzikas, the cafe's owner, who has known the brothers since they were skinny schoolkids and still flies out to matches to support them.  It's so moving, after the misery and poverty they went through,  he said.

Prosecutors have accused Shkreli of lying to investors in the hedge fund and siphoning millions of dollars in assets from biopharmaceutical company Retrophin Inc to repay them. He has pleaded not guilty. The trial, which will be heard by U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn, is expected to last four to six weeks. Shkreli, a boyish-looking 34, outraged patients and U.S. lawmakers by raising the price of anti-parisitic drug Daraprim to $750 a pill, from $13.50, in 2015, when he was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals. The charges that led to his arrest in December 2015 are not related to Turing but focus on Shkreli's management at Retrophin and the hedge fund MSMB Capital Management between 2009 and 2012. Prosecutors said Shkreli lied about MSMB's finances to lure investors and concealed devastating trading losses from them. They said he paid the investors back with money stolen from Retrophin, which he founded in 2011.

He has continued to court the public eye, especially through social media, sometimes complicating his defense. At a hearing last Monday, prosecutors refused to agree to Shkreli's request to reduce his bail by $3 million, which he said he needs to pay taxes and legal bills, pointing to his own public boasts about his wealth. Slideshow (2 Images)Since his arrest, Shkreli has flaunted purchases including a World War II-era Enigma code breaking machine, a Picasso painting and unreleased albums by Wu-Tang Clan and Lil Wayne. In April, he offered $40,000 to a Princeton University student who solved a mathematical proof. In May, he pledged on Facebook to pay $100,000 for tips leading to the arrest of the person who killed former Democratic National Committee employee Seth Rich. Shkreli was banned from Twitter in January for harassing a female journalist who wrote an op-ed piece for Teen Vogue criticizing President Donald Trump, whom Shkreli has supported. Shkreli's attention-seeking has at times exasperated his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, who urged Matsumoto last week not to give much weight to his client's  preposterous statements.

Woods was not planning to play this week at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm in Potomac, Maryland, but it was announced he would not be attending the event that benefits the Tiger Wood Foundation.  As Tiger said, he is receiving ongoing professional help, and because of that, he cannot attend this year's Quicken Loans National,  Woods' spokesman Rick Singer said in a statement.  Tiger will stay in touch with the tournament and receive regular updates during the week.  Woods was arrested on a DUI charge in the early hours of May 29 in Jupiter, Florida, when police found him asleep behind the wheel of his parked car at the side of the road several miles from his home. After tests revealed no trace of alcohol in his system, Woods said that he had a reaction to prescription drugs he was taking. He later announced on Twitter that he is undergoing treatment to manage his prescription drugs use. Woods' DUI arraignment is scheduled for Aug. 9.  He's been in just immense pain for so very long that taking prescribed medication was a must just to be able to get up and move,  said Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent with Excel Sports Management.

The Czech won the Birmingham grasscourt event on Sunday in only her second tournament since returning from the severe injuries to her left playing hand sustained in a knife attack by an intruder at her home last December. She had hoped to continue her preparations at the Aegon International in Eastbourne this week, but pulled out of the tournament on Monday with an abdominal strain. Providing she recovers, the 27-year-old will be high on most people's lists of possible Wimbledon winners as she goes in search of a third title and many think she among the favorites.  Well, actually, I don't,  she told reporters at a sun-drenched Devonshire Park.  I mean, I just came back to play tennis, to enjoy the sport which I always loved.  Maybe the last tournament changed something in people's minds but not in mine. I'm really enjoying every match but, still, I think I do have lot of things to improve.  I showed myself that I can play five matches in six days, but now I need a bit to relax to be ready. I know how tough it is to win a grand slam, so I'm not really seeing myself as one of the favorites right now.  Kvitova said she now felt no discomfort from the hand that required four hours of surgery to repair tendons. But lasting the course of a grand slam throws up physical challenges.  Even if the hand it's not in pain, I really don't know how the body will react,  she said.  The matches are different with the tightness, with the body and the nerves and everything.  Her immediate concern is the injury she felt while beating Australian Ashleigh Barty in the Aegon Classic final on Sunday.  It's an abdominal muscle,  Kvitova, Wimbledon champion in 2011 and 2014, told a news conference.  It got tight in yesterday's final. I hope it's nothing serious, but I do feel one spot specifically. I hope it will be fine in a couple of days.  I will have treatment. I will not practice for a couple of days, for sure. I'm disappointed I can't play here. It's a great tournament. I played the final one year and it's always been great preparation for me for Wimbledon.

As lawmakers digested details of the rescue, which involves the state rather than investors bearing most of the cost, many criticized Rome for breaking with the spirit of a framework known as banking union -- and the European Commission in Brussels for allowing it do so. Under a deal sealed over the weekend, Italy will pay more than 5 billion euros to Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), its top retail bank, to take the best assets of two failed Veneto banks, with up to 12 billion euros of guarantees to shield Intesa from losses. That broke a principle agreed by European leaders and enshrined in European Union law that investors, rather than the state, should shoulder the cost of bank failures.  It was all for nothing,  said Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green party member of the European Parliament who spent months negotiating and writing the law introduced last year.   This is a bad day for Europe. It's another hit to European integration,  he said, describing it as a  major blow  to the euro currency itself and damaging for the image of the European Central Bank, which supervises Europe's biggest lenders. Sven Giegold, an EU parliamentarian who also helped write the law, demanded a parliamentary enquiry into the flouting of the rules, attacking the Commission, the EU's executive. It had the final say in approving the scheme. Investors breathed a sigh of relief following the decision, with shares rallying, while Italy sought to portray the move in a positive light.  It removes one of the chief financial headaches facing the country. One Bank of Italy official even said that the state could eventually make a profit from the deal. But European lawmakers struck a more somber tone. Frosty Reception Markus Ferber, a German lawmaker in the European parliament, said Italy had not respected the new rules and predicted that Germany would be reluctant to pursue closer ties in the 19-member euro zone as a result.  This is bringing banking union to the graveyard,  said Ferber, a member of Bavaria's Christian Democrats, the sister party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling conservatives. The logo of Veneto Banca bank is seen in Venice, Italy, January 31, 2016.Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo It makes no sense to have further integration,  he said, citing the example of pan-European protection of deposits, the next step that had been planned for the banking union.  No-one could seriously grant Italy access to deposit protection.  Germany, worried that it would have to shoulder the bill for failed banks in countries such as Greece or Spain, had been central in writing the rules to force losses on the bondholders and large depositors of failing banks. Germany's finance ministry also gave the Italian announcement a frosty reception.  The use of state aid should be avoided as much as possible in bankruptcy cases,  a spokeswoman for finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said, adding that it was up to the European Commission to ensure that the rules were respected. Rome had hoped healthier Italian banks would club together to help the lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. But most would not, having already spent billions propping up other ailing banks.  Italy's subsequent move to sidestep the EU regime now raises a question mark over the entire framework and whether it can ever be used instead of taxpayer bailouts. The events also cast a cloud over the ECB, which monitored the banks and had deemed them solvent until recently. It declined to comment.  That Italian solution contrasts with Santander's (SAN.MC) recent rescue of a struggling lender in Spain, where it too paid just 1 euro but took on the smaller bank's troubled loans and imposed losses on shareholders, including retail investors. Alberto Ruiz Ojeda, a lawyer from the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholders who is representing Banco Popular investors taking action after the rescue, said the move by Italy would encourage more of those who lost money to sue.  Intesa Sanpaolo is going to benefit from a scheme that Banco Santander has not been able to,  he said.  What we see is discriminatory and unfair treatment. This will give rise to more claims, both from Popular shareholders and bondholders.  While German politicians were among the most vocal critics, lawmakers from other countries also expressed dismay. Greece's banks received more robust treatment and the capital controls introduced to stabilize the country's feebler banks and financial system are still in place.  It is not a fair world. It is obvious that Italy is quite another country to Greece,  said Kostas Chrysogonos, a European lawmaker with Greece's left-wing Syriza party, recalling the strict terms imposed on Athens.   What you have is more a cooperation of states and not an authentic union.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. The proceeds of the offering are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding debt. Fitch currently rates CBS's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'. Approximately $9 billion of debt was outstanding as of March 31, 2017, including $30 million of commercial paper (CP). A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. CBS's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain within Fitch's expectation for the current rating. Gross leverage approximated 2.8x as of the latest 12-month (LTM) period ended March 31, 2017, relatively flat from year-end 2016 and consistent with our expectation that leverage would trend higher owing to the exclusion of the radio segment cash flows (split-off expected to be completed in second half of 2017) and increased shareholder repatriation in 2016. While CBS is maintaining leverage levels close to Fitch's 3x gross leverage target for the current ratings, Fitch believes that the company's solid execution of increasing non-advertising revenue sources, including content licensing, distribution and retransmission revenues, provides the company greater financial flexibility at the current 'BBB' rating level. KEY RATING DRIVERS Outside of investing in its core businesses and growth initiatives, share repurchases continue to be the centerpiece of CBS's capital allocation strategy. Shareholder returns that exceed free cash flow (FCF) generation are incorporated into the current ratings to the extent that leverage remains roughly in-line with Fitch's 3x total leverage threshold. Strong Portfolio of Content Assets: CBS benefits from its strong portfolio of content assets including the CBS Television Network, Showtime Networks and CBS Sports Network. The company is consistently a producer of highly desirable primetime content as evidenced by the CBS Television Network's No.1 position in terms of primetime viewership for the last nine consecutive years. The positioning allows CBS to effectively monetize its programming into advertising revenues, growing retransmission and reverse retransmission revenues, syndication revenues, and over-the-top (OTT) and subscription video on demand (SVOD) revenues. Improved Revenue Mix: Growing content licensing and distribution, affiliate and subscription revenues are improving CBS's revenue mix and are in line with the company's long-term objective to increase non-advertising revenue sources. However, CBS's exposure to advertising revenues at 45% excluding CBS Radio is relatively high compared to other diversified media companies. Growing and Stable Retransmission Revenues: CBS's retransmission consent/reverse compensation revenue surpassed $1 billion in FY 2016 (a full year ahead of schedule) and is expected to grow to $2.5 billion by 2020. This revenue stream provides a stable and recurring element to CBS's revenue base, which mitigates some of the volatility associated with advertising revenues. Additionally, the high margin characteristic of these revenues strengthens the company's operating profile. Executing on Revenue Growth Plan: Fitch believes CBS's plan to leverage its content-centric strategy and increase revenues by an incremental $3.75 billion through 2020 is reasonable. From Fitch's perspective CBS's core businesses are strong and position the company to successfully execute on its revenue growth initiatives. This anticipated revenue growth will serve to further diversify the company's revenue base and de-risk its business model. Exposure to Cyclical Advertising Revenues: Rating concerns include an above-average exposure to cyclical advertising revenue and the company's capacity to adapt to ever-changing media consumption patterns, emerging distribution platforms, and technology evolution - all of which will drive audience fragmentation and disrupt traditional media models. Additional concerns center on the company's ability to balance escalating programming expense and production costs with the requirement to consistently deliver programs that drive incremental share of an increasingly fragmented viewing audience while maintaining or expanding operating margins. DERIVATION SUMMARY CBS benefits from its strong portfolio of assets including the CBS Television Network, the Showtime Networks, and CBS Sports Network. Additionally, CBS benefits from its high proportion of originally produced content. The ratings reflect the progress the company has made in improving revenue mix by increasing the amount of recurring and more stable subscription revenues. While CBS has decreased the total proportion of revenues that stem from advertising revenues to 45% pro forma for the CBS Radio split-off, Fitch notes that this still remains high relative to peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --The base case assumes a stable economic and advertising environment. --Low- to mid-single-digit growth in CBS' Entertainment segment. Notably, CBS does not have the SuperBowl in 2017, which will impact top-line results. --Syndication revenues will continue to be variable and dependent on content availability. CBS is positioned to capitalize on its strong position in first-run syndication (15 of the top 20 syndication shows), a solid pipeline of content coming to off-network syndication and incremental demand for content from OTT and SVOD providers. --Cable Network segment revenue growth reflects the stability of the business and modest affiliation fee increases. The company's investment in original programming supports affiliation fee growth. Fitch anticipates mid-single-digit revenue growth. --Publishing revenues decline modestly in the base case reflecting the ongoing impact of digital migration. --Local Broadcasting segment again incorporates a stable economic and advertising environment as well as the typical political advertising cycle. Additionally, the segment will benefit from growing retransmission consent revenues. Year-over-year comparisons in 2017 are impacted by the planned split-off of CBS Radio and subsequent merger with Entercom which is anticipated to be completed in second-half 2017. --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes modest margin expansion within the Entertainment segment reflecting growth in higher-margin syndication and OTT and SVOD revenues. This is offset by higher content and programming costs. --Cable Network margins are pressured due to increasing programming costs due to higher investment in original programming although this is offset by benefits from new distribution windows. --Publishing margins increases modestly to reflect changing revenue mix to higher margin digital sales. --Local Broadcast margins move in tandem with the political cycle. --All debt is refinanced at maturity. Fitch expects free cash flow to continue to be dedicated to share repurchases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating action would likely coincide with CBS adopting a more conservative financial policy highlighted by a gross leverage target of 2.25x or lower. Moreover, Fitch needs to observe meaningful progress in CBS's efforts to transform its revenue mix and reduce its reliance on cyclical advertising revenues. Meanwhile, CBS will need to demonstrate that its operating profile can sustain itself amid ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption patterns and evolving technology platforms. Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary actions of CBS management including, but not limited to, the company adopting a more aggressive financial strategy which increases leverage beyond 3x or event-driven merger and acquisition activity that drives leverage beyond 3.5x in the absence of a creditable deleveraging plan. Additionally, negative rating actions could result should Fitch begin to observe a negative impact from alternative content distribution platforms and other forms of entertainment that is significantly larger than our expectations. Other negative triggers include a weakening of the company's television studio's ability to produce desired television content, or secure programming on its television networks that consistently delivers viewing audience and related advertising revenues. LIQUIDITY The operating leverage inherent in CBS's business along with modest capital intensity enables the company to generate meaningful levels of FCF and provides the company with substantial financial flexibility. CBS generated approximately $732 million of FCF from continuing operations (defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures and dividends), during the LTM period ended March 31, 2017, which follows $970 million of FCF generation during the year ended Dec. 31, 2016. Notably, CBS made a $100 million discretionary pension contribution in first quarter 2017 which weighed on FCF for the LTM period. Going forward, Fitch anticipates that the company will consistently generate consolidated FCF in excess of $1.2 billion providing CBS with adequate flexibility with in the current ratings to accommodate its capital allocation policy. CBS's liquidity position is strong and supported by $163 million of cash on hand as of March 31, 2017, $2.5 billion in available credit facilities (substantially all of which was available as of March 30, 2017, and expected FCF generation. CBS's revolver commitment expires on June 9, 2021. Scheduled maturities are well-laddered and manageable considering expected FCF generation, reliable market access and backup liquidity. Approximately 20% of the company's debt outstanding as of March 31, 2017 is scheduled to mature over the next five years, including $400 million in 2017, $300 million in 2018, $600 million in 2019, and $500 million in 2020.

As lawmakers digested details of the rescue, which involves the state rather than investors bearing most of the cost, many criticized Rome for breaking with the spirit of a framework known as banking union -- and the European Commission in Brussels for allowing it do so. Under a deal sealed over the weekend, Italy will pay more than 5 billion euros to Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), its top retail bank, to take the best assets of two failed Veneto banks, with up to 12 billion euros of guarantees to shield Intesa from losses. That broke a principle agreed by European leaders and enshrined in European Union law that investors, rather than the state, should shoulder the cost of bank failures.  It was all for nothing,  said Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green party member of the European Parliament who spent months negotiating and writing the law introduced last year.   This is a bad day for Europe. It's another hit to European integration,  he said, describing it as a  major blow  to the euro currency itself and damaging for the image of the European Central Bank, which supervises Europe's biggest lenders. Sven Giegold, an EU parliamentarian who also helped write the law, demanded a parliamentary enquiry into the flouting of the rules, attacking the Commission, the EU's executive. It had the final say in approving the scheme. Investors breathed a sigh of relief following the decision, with shares rallying, while Italy sought to portray the move in a positive light.  It removes one of the chief financial headaches facing the country. One Bank of Italy official even said that the state could eventually make a profit from the deal. But European lawmakers struck a more somber tone. Frosty Reception Markus Ferber, a German lawmaker in the European parliament, said Italy had not respected the new rules and predicted that Germany would be reluctant to pursue closer ties in the 19-member euro zone as a result.  This is bringing banking union to the graveyard,  said Ferber, a member of Bavaria's Christian Democrats, the sister party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling conservatives. The logo of Veneto Banca bank is seen in Venice, Italy, January 31, 2016.Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo It makes no sense to have further integration,  he said, citing the example of pan-European protection of deposits, the next step that had been planned for the banking union.  No-one could seriously grant Italy access to deposit protection.  Germany, worried that it would have to shoulder the bill for failed banks in countries such as Greece or Spain, had been central in writing the rules to force losses on the bondholders and large depositors of failing banks. Germany's finance ministry also gave the Italian announcement a frosty reception.  The use of state aid should be avoided as much as possible in bankruptcy cases,  a spokeswoman for finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said, adding that it was up to the European Commission to ensure that the rules were respected. Rome had hoped healthier Italian banks would club together to help the lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. But most would not, having already spent billions propping up other ailing banks.  Italy's subsequent move to sidestep the EU regime now raises a question mark over the entire framework and whether it can ever be used instead of taxpayer bailouts. The events also cast a cloud over the ECB, which monitored the banks and had deemed them solvent until recently. It declined to comment.  That Italian solution contrasts with Santander's (SAN.MC) recent rescue of a struggling lender in Spain, where it too paid just 1 euro but took on the smaller bank's troubled loans and imposed losses on shareholders, including retail investors. Alberto Ruiz Ojeda, a lawyer from the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholders who is representing Banco Popular investors taking action after the rescue, said the move by Italy would encourage more of those who lost money to sue.  Intesa Sanpaolo is going to benefit from a scheme that Banco Santander has not been able to,  he said.  What we see is discriminatory and unfair treatment. This will give rise to more claims, both from Popular shareholders and bondholders.  While German politicians were among the most vocal critics, lawmakers from other countries also expressed dismay. Greece's banks received more robust treatment and the capital controls introduced to stabilize the country's feebler banks and financial system are still in place.  It is not a fair world. It is obvious that Italy is quite another country to Greece,  said Kostas Chrysogonos, a European lawmaker with Greece's left-wing Syriza party, recalling the strict terms imposed on Athens.   What you have is more a cooperation of states and not an authentic union.

In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata faces tens of billions of dollars in costs and liabilities resulting from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits. Its airbag inflators have been linked to at least 16 deaths and 180 injuries around the world because they can rupture and send metal fragments flying.     TK Holdings, its U.S. operations, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware on Sunday with liabilities of $10 billion to $50 billion, while the Japanese parent filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court early on Monday. Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, said in a court affidavit that the company  faces insurmountable claims  relating to the recalls and owes billions of dollars to automakers. He disclosed that Takata has recalled, or expects to recall, by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide, including  more than 60 million in the United States. Takata's total liabilities stand at 1.7 trillion yen ($15 billion), Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd estimated.  Final liabilities would depend on the outcome of discussions with carmaker customers who have borne the bulk of the replacement costs, a lawyer for the company said. The filings open the door to the financial rescue by Key Safety Systems (KSS), a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS).  In a deal that took 16 months to hammer out, KSS agreed to take over Takata's viable operations, while the remaining operations will be reorganized to continue churning out millions of replacement airbag inflators, the two firms said.  The U.S. company would keep  substantially all  of Takata's 60,000 employees in 23 countries and maintain its factories in Japan. The agreement is meant to allow Takata to continue operating without interruptions and with minimal disruptions to its supply chain. Related CoverageWhat next for airbag maker Takata after bankruptcy filing? We believe taking these actions in Japan and the U.S. is the best way to address the ongoing costs and liabilities of the airbag inflator issues with certainty and in an organized manner,  Takata CEO Shigehisa Takada said in a statement. The remainder of Takata assets will be reorganized to produce replacement inflators, but it is not clear how long they will operate. Takata said it plans to continue building older model inflators for as long as five years at plants in China, Washington state and Mexico. It will not continue producing those inflators at a plant in Germany. Takata Corp. Chairman and CEO Shigehisa Takada bows as he attends a news conference after its decision to file for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo, Japan,  June 26, 2017.Toru HanaiCEO Takada said he and top management would resign  when the timing of the restructuring is set.  His family - which still has control of the 84-year-old company - likely would cease to be shareholders. Takata in February pleaded in a U.S. federal court to a felony charge as part of a $1-billion settlement that included compensation funds for automakers and victims of its faulty airbag inflators. The company expects to honor the terms of the agreement and pay the $850 million due for automaker compensation. Three former senior Takata executives were charged in January in a U.S. court with falsifying test results but have not made a court appearance. About two-thirds of 46.2 million recalled Takata inflators in the United States have not been fixed. In June 2016, federal regulators said inflators in 2001-2003 model Honda and Acura vehicles have up to a 50-percent chance of a dangerous airbag inflator rupture in a crash and urged owners to stop driving until repairs were made. The companies expect to seal definitive agreements for the sale in coming weeks and complete the twin bankruptcy processes in the first quarter of 2018.      Takata warned in bankruptcy documents that if it does not complete the restructuring by March and complete payments owed under the deal, the Justice Department could withdraw the plea agreement and seek higher penalties. Slideshow (3 Images)It also faces hundreds of lawsuits and claims in the United States, Mexico and Canada, including consumer protection lawsuits filed by three states and 100 personal injury and wrongful death claims. A judge in the U.S. Virgin Islands action had ordered Takata recently to pay $8 million into an escrow account but the payment has not been made, Takata said. Honda Motor Co (7267.T), Takata's biggest customer, said it had reached no final agreement with Takata on responsibilities for the recall. Honda said it would continue talks with the supplier but anticipated difficulties in recovering the bulk of its claims. Unprecedented Recalls Takata faces billions in lawsuits and recall-related costs to its clients, including Honda, BMW (BMWG.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and others, which have been paying recall costs to date. It also faces potential liabilities stemming from class action lawsuits in the United States, Canada and other countries. Industry sources have said that recall costs could climb to about $10 billion.     The ammonium nitrate compound used in the airbags was found to become volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat, causing the devices to explode.     Costs so far have pushed the company into the red for three years, and it has been forced to sell subsidiaries to pay fines and other liabilities.    Founded as a textiles company in 1933, Takata began producing airbags in 1987 and at its peak became the world's No.2 producer of the safety products. It also produces one-third of all seatbelts used in vehicles sold globally, along with other components. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said its shares would be delisted on July 27. The stock has collapsed 95 percent since January 2014.

In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata faces tens of billions of dollars in costs and liabilities resulting from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits. Its air bag inflators have been linked to at least 16 deaths and 180 injuries around the world because they can rupture and send metal fragments flying. Takata’s bankruptcy filing is a milestone in a restructuring orchestrated and financed in part by major automakers who need to assure a supply of replacement inflators for tens of millions of their cars that are still subject to recalls. The deal may also result in Key becoming a stronger competitor in the global market for air bag and safety technology and help ensure a broadly competitive air bag market for automakers. TK Holdings, its U.S. operations, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware on Sunday with liabilities of $10 billion to $50 billion; the Japanese parent filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court early on Monday. Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, said in a court affidavit that the company  faces insurmountable claims  relating to the recalls and owes billions of dollars to automakers. He disclosed that Takata has recalled, or expects to recall, by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide, including more than 60 million in the United States. Takata's total liabilities stand at 1.7 trillion yen ($15 billion), Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd estimated. Final liabilities would depend on discussions with carmaker customers who have borne the bulk of the replacement costs, a lawyer for the company said. The filings open the door to the financial rescue by Key Safety Systems (KSS), a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp. Ningbo Joyson acquired KSS in 2016 in a $920 million deal. In a deal that took 16 months to hammer out, KSS agreed to take over Takata's viable operations, while the remaining operations will be reorganized to continue churning out millions of replacement inflators, the two firms said. Jason Luo, CEO of KSS, said in a statement the  underlying strength  of Takata's business had not diminished despite the recall, citing its skilled employees, geographic reach and other safety products such as seat belts. Caudill said automakers would provide Takata up to $400 million over the course of the bankruptcy by accelerating payments and agreeing not to withhold what Takata owes them. In return, Takata agreed to provide the automakers access to their plants to ensure continued supply of parts. Takata does not plan to hold an auction of its assets, often used to ensure assets fetch top dollar for creditors. Caudill said that would be a waste of time, given Takata was extensively shopped prior to the bankruptcy and that only one bidder had clear support from automakers. Takata will ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware to appoint a representative for people who will be injured in the future from Takata inflators. The company said it plans to set aside sufficient money to cover those claims, which will be based on an expert’s estimate. An initial court hearing on the U.S. bankruptcy filing is set for Tuesday.  We believe taking these actions in Japan and the U.S. is the best way to address the ongoing costs and liabilities of the air bag inflator issues with certainty and in an organized manner,  Takata CEO Shigehisa Takada said in a statement. The remainder of Takata assets will be reorganized to produce replacement inflators, but it is not clear how long they will operate.

Thomas Bossert, assistant to the president for homeland security and counter-terrorism, said a U.S.-Israeli working group will meet this week on cybersecurity issues such as protecting critical infrastructure. The U.S. team will include representatives of the State Department, Homeland Security and FBI and work with their Israeli counterparts.  These high level meetings represent the first step in strengthening bilateral ties on cyber issues following  President Trump’s visit to Israel  last month, Bossert told a cybersecurity conference in Tel Aviv.  The agility Israel has in developing solutions will innovate cyber defenses that we can test here and bring back to America. Perfect security may not be achievable but we have within our reach a safer and more secure internet.  He said the group will work on developing  a different operational conscript  that will be focused on finding and stopping attacks before they reach networks and critical infrastructure, while identifying ways to punish attackers.

In Yukon's Dawson City, drinking a cocktail with a pickled toe is a time-honored tradition that more than 100,000 visitors have undertaken, according to the municipality.   The toe was stolen from a local hotel on June 18, sparking national headlines. It came back by mail four days later along with an apology letter, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).  The Travel Yukon government tourism organization asked on Twitter for pictures of toes in the  Toenation Contest,  which will grant the winner a free trip to the remote, sparsely populated territory, a neighbor of Alaska.   Our toe was returned, but we can always use backups!  Travel Yukon tweeted.  Donate yours for a #Yukon trip. Will your toe make the cut?  According to Dawson City, the story behind the cocktail is that a local man created the drink after finding a jar with the amputated frost-bitten toe of a rum-runner from the 1920s.  Be sure to remember the most important rule: 'You can drink it fast, you can drink it slow, but your lips have gotta touch the toe,'  according to the city's website.  RCMP said a male suspect in the theft case called police after officers identified him. The man allegedly left his identification at the hotel, after downing the cocktail, according to the Yukon News. The toe came back with the apology letter, signed  a drunken fool,  according to the newspaper.  At the time that the package was opened, the toe was believed to be in good condition,  RCMP said.

Technology stocks have been under pressure as investors, worried about stretched valuations, switch to defensive sectors. A fall in Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet weighed on the Nasdaq. The S&P; utilities and telecommunications rose about 0.8 percent and led the gainers among the 11 S&P; sectors. The S&P; energy was marginally higher as oil prices rebounded after last week's seven-month lows. But gains were hemmed in by a relentless rise in U.S. supply and a surge in demand for short sale contracts that signal investors see potential for a price fall. The recent drop in oil prices has spurred concerns about low inflation, which stubbornly remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target rate. The central bank raised rates this month for the second time this year and is expected to raise it again. Futures imply only a 50 percent chance of another rate hike by December. At 13:02 p.m. ET (1702 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 46.06 points, or 0.22 percent, at 21,440.82, the S&P; 500 was up 5.32 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,443.62. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.25 points at 6,265.50. The financial index rose 0.57 percent after a string of Federal Reserve policymakers appeared to back another rate hike this year despite a patch of recent weak economic data. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said the Fed needs to raise rates gradually or the economy runs the risk of overheating. New York Fed chief William Dudley said recent narrowing of credit spreads, record stock prices and falling bond yields could encourage the Fed to continue tightening U.S. policy.  We're seeing a very fast rotation that's been typical of the past month or so and it's not necessarily based on what's happening on the yield curve,  said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  It's based more on the economic conversations that we've been seeing from a parade of Fed speakers who continue to tell that same story that we'll see another rate hike this year.  The spread between the U.S. two-year and 10-year bond yield curve flattened to its lowest since September. Data on Monday showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May, with non-defense orders excluding aircraft - a closely watched proxy for business spending plans - dropping 0.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 0.3 percent. Micron was up 2.5 percent at $32.53 after Cowen & Co increased its price target on the chipmaker's stock. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,022 to 870. On the Nasdaq, 1,658 issues rose and 1,157 fell.

The justices ruled 5-4 that the California Public Employees' Retirement System waited too long to sue the banks, upholding a federal appeals court decision throwing out the lawsuit. The dispute involves claims by the fund, known as CalPERS, against units of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group , Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Royal Bank of Canada, France's BNP Paribas SA and Spanish lender BBVA, among others. Lehman Brothers investment bank's collapse in 2008 helped trigger a global financial crisis. CalPERS, an investor in the banks' securities, was a member of a class action suit filed in 2008 claiming the underwriters violated the Securities Act by misrepresenting and omitting facts about Lehman's accounting and risk management practices. In February 2011, CalPERS decided to file a separate lawsuit. When the class action later settled, CalPERS opted out and continued with its own claims. Last year, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York threw out CalPERS' case, saying that a federal law called the Securities Act barred claims more than three years after a security is first offered to the public. Though the Supreme Court has said class actions extend certain deadlines by which individuals who drop out may file lawsuits on their own, the appeals court said this was not one of them. CalPERS appealed to the Supreme Court, saying that if class actions do not extend such deadlines, courts would be bombarded with thousands of costly lawsuits by investors protecting their right to sue on their own later. The underwriters countered in a legal brief that there is no evidence that this  parade of horribles has actually come to pass.

The scores are in some cases being used in a way they are not really designed for,  Hanson said.  It's problematic to bolt them on to an investment process.   There are no set criteria for who is bad and who is good and so-called ESG ratings vary widely, meaning investors may be less protected than they think, for example, from a scandal over labor practices or board pay.  We don't have a common vernacular,  said Asha Mehta, director of responsible investing at Acadian Asset Management in Boston. Sustainability analysis firm CSRHub compared such ratings  given to companies in the S&P; Global 1200 index by two leading firms in the field - a division of MSCI Inc, and Toronto-based Sustainalytics - and found they had a correlation coefficient of 0.32, a relatively weak level.  Credit ratings, in contrast, are closely aligned, with the comparable figure for Moody’s and S&P; ratings of around 0.9, according to research by Northern Illinois University finance professor Lei Zhou.  The difference is that credit ratings rely on financial disclosures while the sustainability ratings may reflect different weightings given to factors such as workers' rights, emissions, or responses to events such as an oil spill or product failure.  Electric car maker Tesla, for example, has received a top AAA score from MSCI, but a middling grade from Sustainalytics, below that of traditional automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors , partly because Tesla does not release carbon emissions data for its manufacturing plants. Tesla declined to comment. In interviews, a dozen professional investors and company executives told Reuters they were frustrated by the lack of common standards, even as many praised the work of the ratings firms individually.  The New York Stock Exchange is seen from the steps of Federal Hall behind a Statue of former U.S. President George Washington in New York City, U.S., May 17, 2017.Brendan McDermidCommon Language One remedy, they say, would be to adopt a common language and reporting requirements. Starting next year, the European Union will require companies to report on their efforts in such areas as the environment and social responsibility. In the United States, a small group of companies, such as JetBlue Airways Corp, has embraced voluntary disclosures suggested by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, an independent organization. As more and more investors recognize the long-term financial benefits of good corporate governance and sustainable policies, the need for uniform criteria becomes more pressing. The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment estimates that more than $8 trillion was invested by U.S. fund managers who incorporated at least some of such criteria in their strategy, up from $1.4 trillion in 2012.     CSRHub counts 17 firms and organizations that track in some form corporate adherence to environmental, social and governance standards, including Thomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters.     At their best, rating firms can help investors avoid losses. For instance, both MSCI and Sustainalytics raised governance concerns about Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) months before the German automaker admitted to cheating on U.S. diesel emissions tests in September 2015.      “They absolutely called that right,” said Seb Beloe, head of sustainability research at WHEB Asset Management in London.     But there is also a risk that they will miss red flags because non-financial information is less readily available and open to interpretation. Simon MacMahon, who oversees ESG research at Sustainalytics, acknowledged sustainability can be difficult to define.  We're talking about a whole host of issues here.  Yet Linda-Eling Lee, head of ESG research at MSCI, said few executives object to its findings.     It's only a handful of companies where we have a back and forth,  she said. Some companies take advantage of the disparities to focus on ratings that are more favorable, said Robert Fernandez, director of ESG research for Breckinridge Capital Advisors in Boston.  You can certainly see how it's a concern that they have divergent views,  he said.      The absence of a common standard has not stopped Wall Street. While larger investment firms usually combine ratings with their own research, some funds are built largely off ratings, even if sponsors acknowledge they may be imperfect. For example, a disclosure from one of the largest, the $866 million iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF, run by BlackRock and based on MSCI ratings notes among its risk factors the chance MSCI might not pick companies with the right  ESG  characteristics.  Lynn Blake, a top investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, said the divergence in ratings, while warranting some caution, may ultimately make little difference for large, diverse portfolios.      We believe they are 'good enough,' particularly for broad universe index funds,  Blake said via e-mail.     The case of Tesla, shows how ratings can reflect differences in approach rather than any flaws in analysis or data.    In its report, Sustainalytics acknowledged CEO Elon Musk's goal of making Tesla's  Gigafactory  built in Nevada entirely powered by renewable energy. Yet it still gave the company an overall score of 55 out of 100 for not disclosing data on the carbon emissions from its automaking operations.       Their lack of corporate sustainability reporting is kind of a shame, especially considering their main product is a low-carbon product,  Sustainalytics' MacMahon said.     Similarly, MSCI rated Tesla 5.3 on a 10-point scale for  carbon emissions,  including its own operations. But that score did not dent Tesla's overall top AAA grade because MSCI gave more weight to other factors, such as emissions of Tesla cars, said MSCI's Lee. Ultimately the firm decides on what to focus on to make the rating more meaningful for investors, she said.      You could give three percent (importance) to lots of issues and at the end of the day, everything averages out,  Lee said.

The country plans to increase spending in its budget for the fiscal year ending June 2018 by 7.3 percent to 31.71 trillion shillings ($14.21 billion), with a key focus on infrastructure. Like neighbouring Kenya, Tanzania wants to take advantage of its long coastline and upgrade outdated railways, ports and roads to serve growing economies in land-locked parts of Africa.  The 2017/18 budget reaffirms the authorities' objective of scaling up public investment while preserving fiscal sustainability,  IMF Deputy Managing Director Tao Zhang said in a statement.  However, potentially over-optimistic revenue projections call for its prudent implementation, including by delaying some large projects until the availability of revenues is confirmed.  In the coming fiscal year, Tanzania plans to borrow 6.17 trillion shillings from domestic sources and expects 3.97 trillion from external concessional loans and grants. It is also seeking an additional 1.59 trillion shillings from external non-concessional loans and raise tax revenue to 14.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2017/18, up from an estimated 13.3 percent previously. Big gas discoveries in the country and oil finds in Kenya and Uganda have turned East Africa into an exploration hotspot for oil firms but transport infrastructure in those countries has suffered from decades of under-investment. In 2015, Tanzania said it planned to spend $14.2 billion to construct a new standard gauge rail network over the next five years, mostly financed with loans. It also wants to invest in a new $10 billion port and special economic zone under a project backed by China and Oman. The IMF's Zhang urged the government to tone down its revenue collection expectations after budget execution in 2016/17 was hit by external financing shortfalls, leading to dismal implementation of capital spending plans and a tight liquidity situation.  To achieve the authorities' development agenda and maintain high economic growth, sustained implementation of reforms, including to create a better and more predictable business environment, is critical,  he said.

Trump,Eric Greitens,John Roberts,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Sonia Sotomayor,USA,COURT/CHURCH (UPDATE 3,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Churches and other religious entities cannot be flatly barred  public money even in states where constitutions explicitly ban such funding, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Monday in a major religious rights case that narrows the separation of church and state. The justices, in a 7-2 ruling, sided with a Missouri church that had been denied state funding for a playground improvement project. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the court's majority, said that the exclusion of Trinity Lutheran Church in Columbia, Missouri  solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution.  In denying Trinity Lutheran Church access to a state grant program that helps nonprofit groups buy rubber playground surfaces made from recycled tires, Missouri cited the funding bar enshrined in its constitution. Its constitution prohibits  any church, sect or denomination of religion  or clergy member from receiving state money, language that goes further than the U.S. Constitution's separation of church and state. Three-quarters of the U.S. states have provisions similar to Missouri's barring funding for religious entities. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion saying the court had swept away legal precedents that allow for limits on state funding of churches. Fellow liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg also dissented.  This case is about nothing less than the relationship between religious institutions and the civil government - that is between church and state. The court today profoundly changes that relationship by holding for the first time that the Constitution requires the government to provide public funds directly to a church,  Sotomayor wrote. The ruling could help religious organizations nationwide win public dollars at least for certain purposes, such as health and safety. It also could buttress the case for using publicly funded vouchers to send children to religious schools rather than public schools. A challenge to a 2015 court decision invalidating a Colorado voucher program was pending before the justices, awaiting the Trinity Lutheran case's outcome. Republican President Donald Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is a prominent supporter of such  school choice  plans. The dispute pitted two provisions of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment against each other: the guarantee of the free exercise of religion and the Establishment Clause, which requires the separation of church and state. 'Commonsense Principle'  The Supreme Court's decision today affirms the commonsense principle that government isn't being neutral when it treats religious organizations worse than everyone else,  said David Cortman, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom conservative Christian legal group who argued the case.  Equal treatment of a religious organization in a program that provides only secular benefits, like a partial reimbursement grant for playground surfacing, isn't a government endorsement of religion,  Cortman added. Trinity Lutheran, which runs a preschool and daycare center, wanted a safer surface for its playground. Trinity Lutheran argued that Missouri's policy violated its right to exercise religion as well as the U.S. Constitution's promise of equal protection under the law. Missouri argued there was nothing unconstitutional about its grant program, noting that Trinity Lutheran remained free to practice its faith however it wants despite being refused state funds. Just before the April oral argument, Missouri's Republican governor, Eric Greitens, reversed the state policy that had banned religious entities from applying for the grant money, saying it was wrong for  government bureaucrats  to deny grants to  people of faith who wanted to do things like make community playgrounds for kids.  Nonetheless, Missouri and the church both urged the justices to decide the case because of the important issues involved and because the governor's action was not irreversible. Trinity Lutheran sued Missouri in federal court in 2012. The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2015 upheld a trial court's dismissal of the suit. The church then appealed to the Supreme Court. Daniel Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's program on freedom of religion and belief, expressed disappointment in the ruling.  Religious freedom should protect unwilling taxpayers from funding church property, not force them to foot the bill. The court's ruling, however, focuses specifically on grants for playground resurfacing, and does not give the government unlimited authority to fund religious activity,  Mach said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-church-idUSL1N1JN0JQ"},

The government will pay 5.2 billion euros to Intesa, and give it guarantees of up 12 billion euros, so that it will take over the remains of Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, which collapsed after years of mismanagement and poor lending. Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said the total funds  mobilized  by the state would be for up to 17 billion euros - three times more than had initially been estimated to recapitalize the banks with public money. The deal, approved by the European Commission, allows Italy to solve a banking crisis on its own terms, ensuring the two Veneto lenders are not wound down under potentially tougher European rules. The cost for taxpayers, however, is hefty.  Those who criticize us should say what a better alternative would have been. I can't see it,  Padoan told reporters after the government spent the weekend drafting an emergency decree to liquidate the two banks. The decree effectively means that the Veneto banks' branches and employees will be part of Intesa Sanpaolo by Monday morning, a move designed to avoid a potential run on deposits that could have spread chaos across the whole banking industry. The decree will have to be voted into law by parliament within 60 days. Related CoverageItaly to appoint special administrators for Veneto lenders: sourceIntesa Sanpaolo board tasks CEO with completing purchase of Veneto banks' assetsUnder the plan, the banks' soured loans, as well as legal risks stemming from a mis-selling scandal, will be moved to a bad bank, partly financed by the state. Junior bondholders and shareholders in the two banks will suffer losses, but senior bonds and depositors will be protected. Padoan said that on top of the 5.2 billion euros payment to Intesa, which includes 1.3 billion euros to cover job cuts, the state will offer guarantees to fund potential losses arising from due diligence of the two banks' soured and risky loans. A treasury source said the government estimated that the total 12 billion euros in guarantees would translate into a fair-value exposure of just 400 million euros for the state, but did not explain how it arrived at that figure. The EU Commission also said in a statement that the  net costs to the Italian state will be much lower than the nominal amounts of the measures provided . It too did not explain. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Veneto Banca bank is seen in Venice, Italy January 31, 2016.Alessandro Bianchi/File PhotoBanking analysts, however, said the state could ultimately be on the hook for up to 17 billion euros, even though some value could be salvaged once the soured loans were fully analyzed, limiting the final bill for taxpayers. 'Tough Conditions' Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's best-capitalized large bank, said last week it was open to purchasing the rump of the good assets for one euro on condition Italy's government passed a decree agreeing to shoulder the cost of winding down the two banks. Setting tough conditions for the deal, Intesa CEO Carlo Messina has insisted that his bank's capital ratios and dividend policy would not be affected by the transaction. Slideshow (6 Images) Without Intesa Sanpaolo's offer - the only significant one submitted at the auction held by the government - the crisis of the two banks would have had a serious impact on the whole Italian banking system,  Messina said in a statement on Sunday. The European Central Bank, which supervises the two lenders based in the country's rich north-eastern Veneto region, had declared on Friday that they were  failing or likely to fail , setting in motion the process that led to them being wound down. After months of tense negotiations between Rome and EU regulators, Italy has been allowed to use national insolvency procedures rather than EU rules designed to prevent the use of state money to deal with bank crises. Those EU rules could have imposed losses on senior bondholders and large depositors, a politically unpalatable prospect ahead of national elections next year given that Italian households hold a large chunk of bonds issued by banks. Some European officials have voiced exasperation at the way Italy has dealt with a string of trouble spots in its banking industry, which is weighed down by nearly 350 billion euros of soured debts -- a third of the euro zone's total. The country's fourth-biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, is being bailed out by the state to cover a capital shortfall of 8.8 billion euros. Four other smaller banks were wound down in 2015. The future of the Veneto banks had hung in the balance over the past two years since the ECB uncovered a capital hole caused by a spike in bad loans and a mis-selling scandal whereby the banks' customers were sold shares in exchange for loans. The dragged-out negotiations between Rome, Frankfurt and Brussels and their outcome on Sunday have raised serious questions about the effectiveness of banking supervision and the credibility of Europe's own rules for dealing with bank crises.

Since  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone  came out in 1997, with a first print run of just 500 copies, the series of seven novels has sold 450 million copies worldwide in 79 languages and spawned a blockbuster movie franchise. The book appeared in the United States a year later as  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone . On Monday, some fans took the day off work to celebrate the anniversary, heading to significant locations such as King's Cross train station in London, which in the stories is one of the gateways into the world of witches and wizards. The real-life station features a mock-up of Platform 9-3/4, the departure point for trains to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The mock-up is a bustling spot where tourists and fans queue to pose for photos wearing Potter-themed scarves or costumes.  Harry Potter I think still means so much to so many people even though it's 20 years now,  said Clara Carson, whose job at the nearby souvenir shop involves taking photos of the fans and holding up the scarves to achieve a windswept effect.  I'm a fan myself so it's really nice to come in and be with people that are all into the same things that you're into,  she said.  Whether they're kids or my age or even adults, they're always just so excited.  Childhood friends Charlotte Keyworth and Joanne Wylie, both 26, had come down to London from northern and eastern England for the occasion.

We've grown up with it, with Harry Potter,  said Keyworth, who was sporting a Hogwarts t-shirt.  We're planning on going to the studio tour this afternoon and celebrating in our own little way,  she said, referring to the studios where the Potter movies were shot.

It was always something that just sort of boosted your spirits and made you realize you could get past the dark points,  she said. Her sentiments were widely echoed on social media, with legions of fans posting their favorite quotes or video clips, or just thanking Rowling for the happy memories.  After all these years...

The justices ruled 5-4 that the California Public Employees' Retirement System waited too long to sue the banks, upholding a federal appeals court decision throwing out the lawsuit. The dispute involves claims by the fund, known as CalPERS,  against units of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ.AX), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), France's BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA) and Spanish lender BBVA (BBVA.MC), among others.  Lehman Brothers investment bank's collapse in 2008 helped trigger a global financial crisis. CalPERS, an investor in the banks' securities, was a member of a class action suit filed in 2008 claiming the underwriters violated the Securities Act by misrepresenting and omitting facts about Lehman's accounting and risk management practices.  In February 2011, CalPERS decided to file a separate lawsuit. When the class action later settled, CalPERS opted out and continued with its own claims. Last year, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York threw out CalPERS' case, saying that a federal law called the Securities Act barred claims more than three years after a security is first offered to the public.  Though the Supreme Court has said class actions extend certain deadlines by which individuals who drop out may file lawsuits on their own, the appeals court said this was not one of them. CalPERS appealed to the Supreme Court, saying that if class actions do not extend such deadlines, courts would be bombarded with thousands of costly lawsuits by investors protecting their right to sue on their own later. The underwriters countered in a legal brief that there is no evidence that this  parade of horribles has actually come to pass.

Demand for rare earths, which range from neodymium used in electric motors to lanthanum used to make batteries, is increasing with the emergence of new, greener technology. While production of coal, iron ore and other bulk commodities is dominated by major mining firms such as BHP and Rio Tinto , rare earths are mostly produced by China and small mining firms such as Mkango.  We think we will be in production in three years' time, just at the right time,  William Dawes, the chief executive of Mkango, which is listed in Toronto and London, told Reuters. By 2021, he said Mkango would reach full output of about 3,000 tonnes per year of rare earths from the southern African nation. That would include 1,000 tonnes of praesodymium, neodymium, dysprosium and terbium, used in new electric motors. Dawes said a rise in rare earth prices was being driven by growing demand, rather than the kind of speculative bubble that drove up prices in 2011 when China dominated production and then prompted a crash that pushed many explorers out of the business.  Very few rare earth projects made it to the pre-feasibility stage and beyond,  he said.  We are one of the few companies to make it over this hurdle, so well-placed as the market recovers.  Ryan Castilloux, an analyst at Adamas Intelligence consultancy, said there were 36 projects at various stages of pre-production development outside of China. Of these, he said about 60 percent were put on hold in the last three years because of weak rare earth prices, although prices were expected to recover. Castilloux forecast doubling global demand for neodymium oxide and praseodymium oxide by 2025 compared with 2016 levels, which he said could create another challenge for miners. If miners could not keep up with demand and prices climbed too high, industries might turn to technologies that did not use rare earths, even if they were less efficient. Dawes said any rapid surge in the price of neodymium, currently trading around $45 per kilogram, could encourage the vehicle industry to turn to induction motors, which do not contain rare earths but which are heavier and less effective than permanent magnet motors that do use rare metals. Analysts say the auto industry is building flexibility into its new generation of electric vehicle platforms to allow a switch between either type of motor. Other rare earth miners outside China include Australia's Lynas Corp, whose Mount Weld is regarded as producing the highest grade of rare earths mine in the world.

Akinwumi Adesina was named the winner of this year's World Food Prize on Monday for his decades-long work to boost food production in his native Nigeria, increase access to credit for small farmers across Africa and transform the continent's agriculture. Kenneth Quinn, president of the Des Moines, Iowa-based World Food Prize Foundation, said the $250,000 award reflected Adesina's  breakthrough achievements  as Nigeria's minister of agriculture and his critical role in the development of the nonprofit Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). Adesina, 57, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation he was humbled by the award but felt his work to ensure Africa could feed itself was  uncompleted business . Almost 30 percent of the 795 million people in the world who do not have enough to eat are in Africa, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  When I look at Africa today I see that many rural areas unfortunately have become zones of economic misery,  Adesina said in a phone interview ahead of the award's announcement. No sector has greater potential to revive those areas than agriculture, but investments are needed to make it attractive for young people, many of whom risk their lives migrating in search of better opportunities in Europe, Adesina said.  We must make agriculture cool for young people,  he said.  The key is to make agriculture a business. Agriculture is not a way of life, is not a development activity, it's a business.  Africa has 65 percent of the world's uncultivated arable land but imports food for $35 billion every year, a bill that is expected to swell to $110 billion by 2025, he said.  It makes no sense. That is food Africa should be producing, processing, selling and exporting,  he said.  Africa in the future should not only feed itself but it must contribute to feeding the world.  Toward this end, agriculture must become more industrialized, with farmers gaining better access to seeds, fertilizer, credit, power and infrastructure, he said. Farmers should be supported to transform from producers of raw materials, such as cocoa and cotton, to manufacturers of finished goods such as chocolate and garments, which have less volatile prices, Adesina said. To accelerate growth, the AfDB aimed to invest $12 billion in the energy sector, hoping to leverage another $50 billion from the private sector, he said.  Last year, AfDB had invested $800 million to support young agro-entrepreneurs in eight countries and planned to extend the scheme to 30 nations, he added. Adesina called on governments and institutional investors, such as pension and insurance funds, to  see the gold  in African agriculture and invest in it to unlock its potential.  He said he was convinced the future billionaires of Africa would come from agriculture.  I don't believe that the future of African youth lies at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea,  he said.  The future of African young people lies in a more prosperous and inclusive Africa, and there is no other sector that has greater power to create growth than the agricultural sector.  Adesina was named winner of the World Food Prize, regarded as the equivalent of a Nobel Prize for agriculture, in a ceremony on Monday at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington.

The justices ruled 5-4 that the California Public Employees' Retirement System waited too long to sue the banks, upholding a federal appeals court decision throwing out the lawsuit. The dispute involves claims by the fund, known as CalPERS,  against units of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ.AX), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), France's BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA) and Spanish lender BBVA (BBVA.MC), among others.  Lehman Brothers investment bank's collapse in 2008 helped trigger a global financial crisis. CalPERS, an investor in the banks' securities, was a member of a class action suit filed in 2008 claiming the underwriters violated the Securities Act by misrepresenting and omitting facts about Lehman's accounting and risk management practices.  In February 2011, CalPERS decided to file a separate lawsuit. When the class action later settled, CalPERS opted out and continued with its own claims. Last year, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York threw out CalPERS' case, saying that a federal law called the Securities Act barred claims more than three years after a security is first offered to the public.  Though the Supreme Court has said class actions extend certain deadlines by which individuals who drop out may file lawsuits on their own, the appeals court said this was not one of them. CalPERS appealed to the Supreme Court, saying that if class actions do not extend such deadlines, courts would be bombarded with thousands of costly lawsuits by investors protecting their right to sue on their own later. The underwriters countered in a legal brief that there is no evidence that this  parade of horribles has actually come to pass.

By a 3-0 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said minor league baseball ruled falls  squarely  within the  business-of-baseball  antitrust exemption that the U.S. Supreme Court granted the sport in 1922.  The employment contracts of minor league players relate to the business of providing public baseball games for profit between clubs of professional baseball players,  Chief Judge Sidney Thomas wrote for the appeals court panel. Monday's decision is a defeat for four plaintiffs who played minor league baseball at some point between 2010 and 2012. They brought class-action claims accusing Major League Baseball and its 30 teams of suppressing wages, leaving most minor leaguers earning between $3,000 and $7,500 annually, and nothing during spring training. In contrast, the minimum salary for major leaguers is $535,000. Samuel Kornhauser, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Matt Bourne, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, declined to comment. The players claimed that Major League Baseball exercised unwarranted control primarily through a  reserve clause  that lets teams retain players' rights for seven years and restricts players' ability to negotiate with other teams. Thomas, however, said the U.S. Congress  has made clear its intent to maintain the baseball exemption for anything related to the employment of minor league players.  He said this in part reflected the 1998 passage of the Curt Flood Act, named for the former St. Louis Cardinals outfielder who unsuccessfully challenged Major League Baseball's reserve clause. Monday's decision upheld a Sept. 2015 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam in Oakland, California.

Tillerson said on June 14 that the Trump administration did not wish to be  handcuffed  by the 2015 accords, brokered in the Belarussian capital by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine, and he suggested Kiev could reach a separate, independent agreement with Moscow. Three years after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and then backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine in fighting that has seen 10,000 people killed, there is little sign of a peaceful solution despite a ceasefire agreement signed in February 2015 in Minsk. Speaking after meeting Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Macron said:  We need to give ourselves a few months to succeed within the framework of these accords.  Referring to Tillerson's comments to a U.S. congressional hearing, Macron said:  I see that for some this is not ideal ... but I have not seen a better solution being offered or rather I have not understood it.  The question is not about the principles since these accords have been signed, but the question of daily implementation,  he said. In an interview with Reuters, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said he was not especially concerned by separate U.S. efforts.  They (the United States) are considering how to engage,  he said, suggesting Washington might be considering a  parallel track with a different level of engagement .  This is not the real issue. (What matters) is our joint commitment to getting results and whether the level of coordination is enough to get them,  Klimkin said. Asked about a potential weapons deal with the United States following Poroshenko's visit to Washington on June 21, Klimkin said details were still being finalised.

We need to match their capabilities to not let them engage in further attacking actions. It's not about escalating the conflict, but keeping the Russians at bay.  Tangible Results Slideshow (5 Images)Both Macron and Poroshenko said they hoped a new  Normandy format  summit - involving the leaders of Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia - would take place in the coming weeks, but officials cautioned this would be a pointless effort unless there were tangible results. The four leaders would speak by phone in the coming days.  In Berlin, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that both sides in eastern Ukraine were violating the ceasefire and expressed doubts over prospects for resolving the crisis in the near-term. To avoid fruitless talks, Macron said he wanted pre-conditions set before any future negotiations, including breakthroughs on removing troops from borders, greater monitoring by international observers and progress on the humanitarian and prisoner situation. Poroshenko said he was much more optimistic after meeting Macron that the summit could produce concrete achievements.  We want documents to be prepared beforehand so that they can bring peace in Ukraine,  he said.

Chances are if he were still at his peak today he would not have needed to adapt the aggressive baseline style that earned the Czech-born American eight grand-slam titles. In fact, not since Croatian Goran Ivanisevic beat Australian Pat Rafter in 2001 has there been a final featuring two players adopting the serve-and-volley style once deemed mandatory. The perception is that the All England Club's decision to change to a new, more durable, perennial rye grass in 2000 has made those skills increasingly redundant. The ATP's strategy analyst, Craig O'Shannessy, believes the  romantic  notion of dashing and daring at the net needs to be  thrown out of the window  -- and the statistics agree. In 2002, ironically the year baseliner Lleyton Hewitt won the title, serve-and-volley made up 33 percent of total points in the men's draw. By 2010 it had dropped to single digits and has remained there ever since, even if the success rate remains close to the historical benchmark of 70 percent. So are the days gone when grasscourt tennis was truly a different ball game? Are the likes of Spain's Feliciano Lopez, Croatian Ivo Karlovic, Luxembourg's Gilles Muller and Germany's Mischa Zverev, the last of a dying breed of players prepared to serve-and-volley, a doomed species? Veteran Lopez, who occasionally threw in a serve and volley while memorably winning the Queen's Club title on Sunday, says grass is still quickest but a range of factors make net-rushing a dangerous game.  Before, there were 20 or 30 guys playing serve-and-volley,  the 35-year-old told Reuters.  But in the last 15 years the balls have changed, the courts, generally on Tour, are a little slower and guys are stronger. They hit winners from anywhere.  But American John Isner, one of the game's tallest players and biggest servers, does not even rate Wimbledon's lawns as the fastest surface. 'Australia Fastest'  I think the Australian Open is the fastest surface, especially the outer courts,  Isner, who rarely serves and volley despite his weapons, told Reuters.  The court I played on, and lost on, was lightning fast. In my opinion the Aussie Open is fastest, depending on which court, Then I would say Wimbledon.  Isner said that grass courts still offered a  premium  for fast serving but once rallies start, the world's best baseliners -- the likes of Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray -- have the edge.  There is a huge emphasis on serving a lot of first serves,  the American said.  But the trueness of the surface means that guys can play at the back. As it wears down naturally, it basically plays like a hard court.  Serve-and-volley has gone by the wayside and it's not necessarily the courts. Players just pass so well now.  Statistics released by IBM after last year's Wimbledon found that 71 percent of rallies were still fewer than four strokes -- but a tiny majority of them involved serve and volley. It was an almost identical picture at the U.S. Open and Australian Open and not much less at the French. Wimbledon was also virtually identical to the U.S. Open and Australian Open, about 20 percent, for rallies requiring five-to-eight strokes with the French Open marginally more. The figures suggest the uniqueness of grass as gone. American Sam Querrey, who blasted Novak Djokovic off the court at Wimbledon last year, said:  You don't see guys serving and volleying as much, but you're still rewarded with a big serve and aggressive play.  Querrey served 31 aces in that match but rarely followed in his delivery, preferring to build pressure. It's a far cry from the 1980s and 1990s when serve-and-volley kings such as John McEnroe, Bjorn Borg, Boris Becker, Pat Cash and Pete Sampras ruled on a Centre Court surface that, after two weeks, resembled straw and dust. Evergreen Courts When this year's Wimbledon reaches its finale, Centre Court will be green and the only dust will be behind the baselines. Bad bounces will be almost non-existent. Big-serving Australian Sam Groth says the quality of the modern-day grass court works against the serve-and-volleyers or those adopting the chip-and-charge routine of yesteryear.  I would prefer if it were a bit more chopped up and a bit quicker,  Groth told Reuters at the Nottingham grasscourt event.  Look at the old footage. They used to get chewed up. It's easy to play a groundstroke when the ball bounces true. I think back to years gone by and the ball would check more than it does now. It was harder to play from the baseline.  Neil Stubley, the All England Club's head groundsman, makes no apology for spoiling his fun.  Back in the day, you would have players actually aiming for the scuffed up areas near the T because they knew it would check and the ball would bounce oddly,  he told Reuters.  I would hate it if we got to a men's or women's final and the court was involved in winning that point.  He rejects the notion his courts have been slowed down.  I think now it's the firmer bounce,  he said.  It appears slower but what it actually is is the bounce giving players that extra tenth of a second to react.

When Prada boss Patrizio Bertelli pulled the team backed by the Italian luxury goods group out of the competition in April 2015, he offered key members of his team to help Emirates Team New Zealand, which is now challenging Oracle Team USA. As the holder of the  Auld Mug , the U.S. team gets to decide the rules, and the decision to change the specifications of the boats stirred the already bad blood with the Italians, who called the change an  abrupt and unacceptable imposition . Most significant among the team members who joined New Zealand's attempt to dethrone Oracle was former Luna Rossa skipper and team director Max Sirena who switched ship in October 2015 to work alongside New Zealand CEO Grant Dalton. Sirena won the 33rd America’s Cup with BMW Oracle Team and led the Luna Rossa challenge in the 34th edition of the cup.  Luna Rossa said at the time of his move to Emirates Team New Zealand that this underlined  the sporting and friendly ties of mutual respect  built up since 2000. As well as helping the New Zealand team out with personnel including designers, Bertelli has also helped them with support boats and other  assets , America's Cup sources told Reuters. For the Record  These ties could come into play in the next phase of the cup because victory for New Zealand, who lead the U.S. holders in the first-to-seven competition, would mean they get to decide on the format of the 36th America's Cup. A close relationship between Bertelli and Matteo de Nora, who is Team Principal and a financial supporter of Emirates Team New Zealand, has led to expectations among other America's Cup teams, sponsors and sailors that Luna Rossa will become the  Challenger of Record  if New Zealand win. Under the terms set out by the America's Cup  Deed of Gift , which dates back to the 1850s, the Challenger of Record is the first one accepted by the new defender of the cup.  This is done formally by a yacht club linked to one of the teams and there is usually a scramble to get the challenge in as soon as the final race is decided, with notice being served to the winning team as their boat crosses the finish line. The challenger then negotiates initial crucial terms of the next cup, including location, the type of boat, the format and the rules under which teams will compete.  We all understand that they (New Zealand) are likely to have Luna Rossa as a challenger of record, but what their plans and intentions are is completely unknown,  America's Cup Regatta Director Iain Murray told Reuters this week.  Oracle has signed up to a  framework agreement  with four of the other challengers this year which would mean the cup being held every two years in foiling catamarans and a series of match races along the lines of Formula One around the world. But not everyone liked the idea, with some saying it was not true to the spirit of the cup and New Zealand boycotted it. The New Zealand camp have not said so far what they will do if they win the cup back.  Editing by Adrian Croft","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sailing-americas-italy-idUSKBN19G0WF"},

It was the summer of 2015 when, on the suggestion of his coach, Severin Luthi, Federer unleashed the SABR, the  Sneak Attack By Roger . Charging forward as his opponent tossed the ball, Federer would return serve on the half-volley, rushing the server. The tactic gave Federer an extra dimension and put doubt into the mind of his opponents, who were never sure if and when he would try it. But it seems that the SABR may have also been the catalyst for the improvement in Federer's backhand that was so instrumental in helping him to Australian Open victory at the start of this year, and looks set to spearhead his assault on Wimbledon. At 35, after six months out following knee surgery, Federer stunned the tennis world with his victory in Melbourne, but it was the way he attacked his backhand, especially in the final against Rafael Nadal, that was such a revelation.  Roger did something unbelievable and I believe that it is true that his backhand is great now,  Nadal told a small group of reporters last month in Monte Carlo.  But in my opinion his return is one of the biggest improvements.  Craig O'Shannessy, the analyst for the ATP Tour, believes shortening his backswing to play the SABR helped take Federer’s backhand – and his backhand return - to another level.  With the SABR it was the half-volley and insanely short in the stroke whereas on (the regular) return, he's letting it come at him but it's essentially a similar, very short blocking rebounding stroke,  O'Shannessy told Reuters.  The size of the backswing gets Roger in trouble. Now he's removed that size, it hasn't taken anything away from the speed, he's still accelerating into contact really well and he's taking the ball a little earlier so he actually has more speed to work with, taking it early with that ball coming out of the court.  For so long, Federer's rivalry with Nadal was marked by the Spaniard's ability, especially on clay, to attack the Federer backhand, forcing him to slice returns and put him on the defensive. In the Melbourne final, Federer barely sliced a return at all, driving backhand after backhand, 14 of them for winners, including eight in the deciding set as he won his record 18th grand slam title. In the 2017 Australian Open, Federer hit 76 backhand winners in seven matches, compared to 37 in 2016. He made 80 percent of returns on the backhand side, more consistent than the forehand (72 percent), which, together with his serve, has so long been a big weapon for Federer. While the use of a racket with a slightly bigger head size has undoubtedly helped add consistency, Federer says practice and confidence have also been key.  I think (it has helped) a lot because it's been solid, I can count on it,  Federer told the ATP.  I think I've really gotten confident through a lot of practice at the end of last year and then in matches and I was able to drive the backhand more than I did before.  I'm coming over the backhand return much more, which allows me to enter the point in a much more aggressive fashion, and it seems to be working so far.  In Melbourne, Federer consistently focused on going cross-court with his backhand, exploiting the space Nadal sometimes leaves on the forehand side. O'Shannessy said the technique on the return has transferred perfectly to the backhand in rallies.  When you commit to that strategy it becomes cleaner, it becomes simpler and because you're practicing it all the time it's getting better,  he said.  He's seeing instant results from it, he's playing shorter points, so then what happens is he has that feel of that blocking, aggressive backhand from the return, and he simply copies and pastes it into a rally.

The High Council for Financial Stability (HCSF), which is headed by Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, said after its quarterly meeting that it was keeping close tabs on  the rise in cyclical risks .  If this trend becomes entrenched, the HCSF ... could be led to soon review necessary measures to boost the banking system's resilience and protect the smooth financing of the economy,  it said in a statement. In that context, it added that it was preparing a decision at the end of the month on a countercyclical bank capital buffer, which has been set at zero since its creation at the end of 2015. The central bank has recently flagged concerns about accelerating credit growth in France, which was up seven percent over one year in April for non-financial companies, while household debt rose 5.8 percent and mortgage volumes increased 5.6 percent.  The strength of growing indebtedness, which has led us to debt levels higher than most of our neighbours, calls for a particular vigilance on the part of authorities,  Bank of France deputy governor Robert Ophele said in a speech last week. The HCSF said that corporate debt levels varied widely among firms, but said it was giving particular attention to the risk the weakest companies represented to the financial system. Though many big French firms have binged on cheap debt amid record low borrowing rates, so far that has not translated into higher bankruptcy rates or levels of bad loans, data from the central bank shows. With a recovery entrenching in France's real estate market in part due to cheap loans, the HCSF also said faster mortgage growth must not threaten the banking sector nor spur on speculation.

I really wanted to participate, and do something, but I didn't want to vote for any of the three candidates,  Khishigjargal, a 22-year old translator, said after leaving her ballot blank at a polling station in the capital Ulaanbaatar.   In the end, if enough people vote blank there could be another election,  she told Reuters. Most voters expect a two-horse race between the ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP) candidate Miyeegombo Enkhbold, an investment-friendly career politician, and former martial arts star and resource nationalist Khaltmaa Battulga of the opposition Democratic Party. But Sainkhuu Ganbaatar of the breakaway Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) could win enough votes to force a second round in two weeks.

Polling is not permitted during campaigning, but according to a national survey in March, Enkhbold's MPP - which won by a landslide in the parliamentary vote last year - is more trusted when it comes to running the country.  For me, the most important things are solidarity and unity, which are more important than party divisions,  said Lantu Erdenechimeg, a 50-year old government official, adding that he had voted for Enkhbold because of his unity pledge.  Battulga, who is suspicious of neighbouring China, Mongolia's major trade partner, also says he will restore Mongolia's  pride  under the slogan  Mongolia will win . The populist politician, who derives his fashion attire from mafia boss Vito Corleone in  The Godfather  films and owns a Genghis Khan-themed amusement park, told Reuters at a recent rally he will win because his heart is  devoted  to Mongolia.

Bart Schwartz, chairman of professional monitoring firm Guidepost Solutions LLC, was appointed by the government as a receiver for two of Platinum's three hedge funds after prosecutors in December accused leaders of the firm of running a more than $1 billion fraud. The six men pleaded not guilty to criminal and civil charges. However, Schwartz and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff working on the case have  differing views  on how best to liquidate Platinum's portfolio, according to a letter he sent on Friday to Brooklyn federal court Chief Judge Dora Irizarry, announcing his intention to resign as Platinum's receiver. Irizarry would need to approve his resignation. Schwartz has been trying to unwind roughly 100 complicated and difficult-to-sell investments, aiming to potentially return hundreds of millions of dollars to investors and creditors. Putting more money into some of the investments could boost their value over the long term, allowing for higher redemptions, Schwartz wrote. However, SEC employees believe the underlying companies are too risky to put more money into, and want to sell the assets as quickly as possible to minimize costs, he said. SEC staffers are concerned about Schwartz’s relationship with an unnamed law firm that is now a debtor to the Platinum estate, according to the letter. However, Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor, said it was not an issue.  My prior involvement with this firm did not have any effect on my actions as receiver nor did it negatively affect my ability to attempt to recover assets,  he wrote. Spokesmen for Schwartz and the SEC declined to comment. The SEC has already consented to his resignation and plans to suggest a new receiver if Irizarry approves the change. Platinum was the subject of a Reuters investigation published in April 2016 that highlighted its many complicated and illiquid investments in controversial companies. (reut.rs/2sJ4OPU) An April status report said that the assets under Schwartz's purview were worth more than $600 million. That number, however, was based on calculations by Platinum's own staff and the December charges involved inflating asset values. The receiver, with the help of an outside expert, has been independently assessing the value of the Platinum Partners Credit Opportunities Fund and the Platinum Partners Liquid Opportunity Fund. In February, Schwartz found there had not been a  major shift  from Platinum's estimates of the portfolio's value since an initial review following his appointment in December. Platinum's largest group of funds, Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage, is being wound down under the supervision of a Cayman Islands-based liquidator. Platinum represented the gross value of its funds to be $1.7 billion at the time of the criminal charges.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/hedgefunds-platinum-idUSL1N1JN0XN"},

Investors in U.S. crude futures and options increased their bets against any future further rise in prices, as the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation hit its highest in over three years. “U.S. production could jump to 10, maybe 10.5 million barrels a day by the end of the year, and when you add Libya, Nigeria and North Sea production that will negate the Saudi-led cuts,  said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. U.S. output has steadily grown to around 9.35 million barrels per day. The rise in supplies threatens efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners to reduce global oil inventories with production cuts. U.S. Treasury yields fell after the soft new capital goods orders data. The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve speakers including New York Fed President William Dudley have indicated further monetary policy tightening is likely even as economic data disappoints. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.1283 percent, from 2.144 percent late on Friday. The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds fell to 93.1 basis points, the flattest since late 2007. “Inflation is the key,” said Thomas Simons, a senior money market economist at Jefferies in New York. “Until oil moves meaningfully higher and people start to get convinced that inflation is going to come back, this curve flattening is going to continue.” Gold tumbled to its lowest price in nearly six weeks as a large sell order hit sentiment on Monday, though losses were limited by political uncertainty around the world. The sale of 1.85 million ounces of gold and 5,000 ounces of silver in a short time was behind the fall in prices, said Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS in Switzerland. Spot gold dropped 1.0 percent to $1,243.60 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.96 percent to $1,244.30 an ounce. Copper lost 0.03 percent to $5,798.50 a tonne.

Overall spending rose 1.4 percent, pushed higher by the refunds and a sharp 15 percent rise in investment, while revenues were stable in January-May.  Throughout the rest of the year the effects of the early refunds will dissipate,  the ministry said in a statement, adding that extra tax refunds in the period totaled over 1.5 billion euros. Income tax refunds exceeded those at the same time last year by six times as they are now processed faster.  After good results in the first quarter that showed a deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP, this result shows that this year's target is within reach,  it said. After achieving a deficit of just 2 percent last year - the lowest in Portugal since at least 1975 - the government now aims to cut the gap to 1.5 percent in 2017. The budget deficit narrowed to 1.7 percent of gross domestic product in the 12 months ending in March from 2 percent at the end of last year, official data showed on Friday. In the first quarter alone the deficit narrowed to 2.1 percent from 3.3 percent in the same period of 2016.

He went to Ukraine and hired 120 people to develop mobile apps and web platforms for international clients and smaller Israeli startups.  I worked for years in the Israeli market and I knew what the costs were in Israel and I knew there was a shortage of workers,  he told Reuters. Driven by startups, Israel's technology industry is the fastest growing part of the economy. It accounts for 14 percent of economic output and 50 percent of exports.  But a shortage of workers means its position at the cutting edge of global technology is at risk, with consequences for the economy and employment. The government's Innovation Authority forecasts a shortage of 10,000 engineers and programmers over the next decade in a market that employs 140,000. Israel has dropped six spots in three years to 17th in the World Economic Forum's ranking of the ease of finding skilled technology employees. The shortage is particularly painful for Israel's 5,000 startups which compete for talent with development centers of technology giants such as Google, Intel, Microsoft and Apple. They offer big incentives that a startup cannot afford. Israel will lose its edge if the shortage isn't tackled, said Noa Acker, head of policy at the societal challenges division at the Innovation Authority.  Salaries will be very high and the industry will shrink to only very high level R&D; while much of the work will be exported,  she said.  Maths Lessons, Boot Camps The main reason for the shortfall is a sharp drop in the number of computer science, maths and statistics graduates, down from a peak of 3,000 in 2005 to a low of 1,600 in 2008. This is partly due to problems in secondary and primary schools where lack of funding means some classrooms do not have computers and advanced maths teachers are in short supply.  Why do we still have classes where there are no computers?  said Yifat Turbiner, a researcher in entrepreneurship and innovation at Ben-Gurion University.  If more budgets aren't allocated to generate a technological state of mind ... from elementary school, I believe all industries will suffer, not just high-tech.  Another reason for the shortage of computer science graduates is that after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000 many Israeli high tech workers lost their jobs, Acker said. This meant that students lost interest in tech careers and university applications declined. FILE PHOTO: Employees work at website-designer firm Wix.com offices in Tel Aviv, Israel July 4, 2016.Baz Ratner/File PhotoThe Education Ministry has announced plans to boost studies of maths and science, especially in high-schools outside the cities where advanced classes are not always available. But Turbiner said initiatives are also needed for a higher standard of maths at a younger age including training more teachers. The government also has long-term initiatives to integrate ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arabs -- two fast-growing segments of the population with low labor participation -- into the industry.  Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up about 11 percent of the population and many prioritize religious studies over science and maths.  Military technology expertise gained by soldiers during their service has been behind several successful Israeli firms including the country’s biggest tech company, Check Point Software Technologies. The government is also running  boot camps  of up to 18 months to train tech workers without technology degrees. Slideshow (12 Images)Good Connections While the government takes steps to stimulate organic growth of workers at home, it is also making changes to visas for a quick fix of importing foreign workers.  The government is preparing 500 visas for students from abroad who studied science and engineering at Israeli universities so they can stay to work at tech firms for a year. It is also working on easing bureaucratic hurdles to unlimited “expert visas”.  In the meantime, many Israeli startups are looking abroad. Ukraine is the top destination with about 100 Israeli development centers. A strong tradition of maths and computer science teaching that is present in many countries in former Soviet Union countries means Ukraine has more than 20,000 IT graduates each year. The 1990s arrival of a million immigrants from former Soviet countries, many of them scientists who went to work for technology companies, has also created strong ties. Israeli companies have also recruited workers in other eastern European countries such as Poland and Bulgaria.  Wix.com, which helps small businesses build websites and is one of Israel's hottest tech companies, employs 120 workers in two development centers in Ukraine and another 80 at a site in Lithuania.  They are in the same time zone, they have a good level of English and all are Russian speakers. Some of our people here are former Russians,  said Boaz Inbal, general manager of Wix's development centers.  We have direct flights to both countries. It's easy for us to collaborate and communicate.  Salaries for software developers in Ukraine are about 40 percent lower than in Israel, said Andrey Link, an executive vice president at Ukrainian software engineering firm Infopulse.  But he said:  The key argument in our favor is not the cost but availability. To find 2-3 people (in Israel) is not a problem, but if they need...an R&D; center for 100 people, it is very difficult in Israel.

The drug, Adcetris, co-developed with Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, met the goal of helping blood cancer patients live longer without worsening their condition. However, the difference in the progression free survival rate of patients on the combination therapy testing Adcetris and the control arm was about 5 percent - 82.1 percent for the drug versus 77.2 percent in the control arm. The relatively modest improvement of about 5 percent could generate cost concerns among insurers, SunTrust Bank analyst Yatin Suneja said. Bothell, Washington-based Seattle Genetics shares slumped as much 13.7 percent to $53.30 in afternoon trading on Monday.  Adcetris is approved in the United States to treat patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, who have already received a stem cell transplant or two chemotherapies. The drug is also approved to treat anaplastic large cell lymphoma in patients who have undergone chemotherapy. However, analysts did not write off the benefits that the drug could offer over the standard treatment, which is a combination of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) drugs.  Eliminating bleomycin should be enough to ensure commercial success with a broad label,  Morgan Stanley analysts said. One of the fatal side effects of bleomycin is pulmonary toxicity. Doctors for long have been trying to get rid of bleomycin from the chemotherapy regimen to increase the long-term durable response rate and decrease toxicity, Seattle Genetics Chief Executive Clay Siegall told Reuters. Seattle Genetics said it would file for an expanded label in the United States as soon as possible.

Chief Executive Pieter van der Does said on Friday that his  Amsterdam-based company was awarded a European regional banking licence in late April by the Dutch Central Bank on behalf of the European Central Bank. Swedish payments processing rival Klarna said last week that it also had been granted a European banking licence by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, as more fintech players seek to level the regulatory playing field versus banks. The European banking license gives Adyen the status of an acquiring bank, clearing the way for it to process merchant payments nearly instantly, rather than relying on banking partners to handle settlements over several days.  We are displacing the banks because we have our own banking licence,  van der Does said in an interview on the sidelines of the NOAH venture capital conference in Berlin. Adyen itself has no plans to become a deposit-taking, full-service bank, but looks for the licence to give it control over the payments process to assure merchants of faster settlements.  The company, which handles international payments for eight of the top 10 global ecommerce giants including Airbnb, Booking.com, Spotify and Facebook, began seeking bank licences in other jurisdictions six years ago, van der Does said. It also handles international payments for a large number of airlines and a growing number of retailers with global operations. In Brazil, Adyen is already licensed as a local payments institution. It is pursuing licences in the United States and other parts of Latin America and Asia.  Van der Does said that Adyen acts as the acquiring bank for a little over half of all of its transaction volume, which grew to $90 billion in 2016, up 80 percent from a year earlier.  So far, it is an acquirer for merchants in Australia, Brazil, Europe, Hong Kong and the United States. The company relies on renting licences from banking partners in some areas of its business, including airline payments processing, in order to avoid having to assume balance sheet risk in that potentially volatile market.

Bart Schwartz, chairman of professional monitoring firm Guidepost Solutions LLC, was appointed by the government as a receiver for two of Platinum's three hedge funds after prosecutors in December accused leaders of the firm of running a more than $1 billion fraud. The six men pleaded not guilty to criminal and civil charges. However, Schwartz and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff working on the case have  differing views  on how best to liquidate Platinum's portfolio, according to a letter he sent on Friday to Brooklyn federal court Chief Judge Dora Irizarry, announcing his intention to resign as Platinum's receiver. Irizarry would need to approve his resignation. Schwartz has been trying to unwind roughly 100 complicated and difficult-to-sell investments, aiming to potentially return hundreds of millions of dollars to investors and creditors. Putting more money into some of the investments could boost their value over the long term, allowing for higher redemptions, Schwartz wrote. However, SEC employees believe the underlying companies are too risky to put more money into, and want to sell the assets as quickly as possible to minimize costs, he said. SEC staffers are concerned about Schwartz’s relationship with an unnamed law firm that is now a debtor to the Platinum estate, according to the letter. However, Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor, said it was not an issue.  My prior involvement with this firm did not have any effect on my actions as receiver nor did it negatively affect my ability to attempt to recover assets,  he wrote. Spokesmen for Schwartz and the SEC declined to comment. The SEC has already consented to his resignation and plans to suggest a new receiver if Irizarry approves the change. Platinum was the subject of a Reuters investigation published in April 2016 that highlighted its many complicated and illiquid investments in controversial companies. (reut.rs/2sJ4OPU) An April status report said that the assets under Schwartz's purview were worth more than $600 million. That number, however, was based on calculations by Platinum's own staff and the December charges involved inflating asset values. The receiver, with the help of an outside expert, has been independently assessing the value of the Platinum Partners Credit Opportunities Fund and the Platinum Partners Liquid Opportunity Fund. In February, Schwartz found there had not been a  major shift  from Platinum's estimates of the portfolio's value since an initial review following his appointment in December.   Platinum's largest group of funds, Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage, is being wound down under the supervision of a Cayman Islands-based liquidator. Platinum represented the gross value of its funds to be $1.7 billion at the time of the criminal charges.

The agency has also affirmed Prudential Plc's (Prudential) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and senior unsecured debt at 'A'. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed Prudential's US subsidiaries Jackson National Life Insurance Company's and Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York's (collectively JNL) IFS Ratings at 'AA'. The Outlooks on the group's Long-Term IDRs and IFS ratings are Stable. A full list of ratings actions is available at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Prudential's strong and resilient capital position, operational scale and strong business position in each of the group's key markets: the UK, the US and Asia. Prudential has strong cash generation and a strategy focused on high-margin products with short pay-back periods and a profitable asset management business. Prudential's ratings also benefit from the group's geographical diversification across the UK, US and 14 countries in Asia. At end-2016, the group's score on Fitch's Prism factor-based capital model (FBM) was 'extremely strong', its regulatory Solvency II ratio was 171% and its UK with-profits fund Solvency II own funds were GBP8.4 billion. Prudential maintains leading positions in the UK, US and Asia. In the UK, Prudential is a leading company in the with-profits savings market and Prudential's in-house asset manager, M&G;, is one of the largest asset managers in the UK. In the US, under the banner of Jackson National Life, Prudential is one of the main sellers of variable and fixed annuities. Fitch believes that variable annuity (VA) products with embedded options and guarantees give rise to risks that are complex, long-tailed, and difficult to price, hedge and reserve for. While Prudential has been effectively managing these risks, continued growth in the group's exposure to the VA business could negatively impact Fitch's assessment of the group's business profile and overall ratings. In Asia, the group has established one of the strongest franchises of a western company. Asia continues to contribute over half of the group's new business sales (2016: 57%) and we believe Prudential is well-placed to exploit the low penetration of the Asian insurance markets and benefit from rising personal wealth across the region. Fitch views Prudential's earnings power and cash generation as strong, reflecting the group's focus on high-margin products with short payback periods. Return on equity was 14% in 2016, reduced from 21% in 2015 due to the negative impact of short-term investment movements. However, this remains commensurate with the rating level. Prudential is exposed to significant credit risk through the credit portfolios backing its non-profit business, including annuities in the US and the UK. A worsening in actual or expected credit defaults or rating downgrades on these portfolios, which had a combined market value of GBP90 billion at end-2016, is an inherent risk. Changes in life expectancy will be a driver of long-term profitability, as the group is exposed to potential longevity improvements on its large in-force annuity book in the UK. We view JNL and PAC as 'core' to the group under our rating methodology, based on a history of supporting group objectives, centralised risk, capital and decision-making functions and the resulting geographical diversification benefits. Both entities are material, with the US representing 47% of the group's insurance operating profit in 2016 and the UK representing 18%. Given JNL's 'core' status within the group and the potential group support that Fitch assumes, JNL is rated at the same level as Prudential. However, JNL's credit profile suggests that the ratings would be lower on a standalone basis. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include a significant increase over time in the group's exposure to VA business; a fall in Prudential's Prism score to the low end of the 'very strong' category; Fitch-calculated financial leverage over 25% (end-2016: 16%); or crystallisation of material credit risk, longevity risk or adverse policyholder behaviour. Following the UK vote to leave the European Union, the UK sovereign rating was downgraded to 'AA'/Negative. A further one-notch downgrade of the UK would not automatically lead to any rating actions on Prudential or its subsidiaries due to the group's global diversification. However, a multiple-notch downgrade of the UK could lead to a downgrade of Prudential's ratings (see: Fitch Affirms Prudential Plc's IFS at 'AA'; Outlook Stable dated 30 June 2016 on www.fitchratings.com). A downgrade of Prudential would trigger a downgrade of JNL and PAC. As Fitch factors group support into JNL's rating, which would be lower on a standalone basis, JNL's ratings could also be downgraded if, in Fitch's view, the strategic importance of JNL to Prudential declines. As Prudential has the joint-highest IFS Rating among European insurance groups an upgrade is unlikely in the near term.

Bart Schwartz, chairman of professional monitoring firm Guidepost Solutions LLC, was appointed by the government as a receiver for two of Platinum's three hedge funds after prosecutors in December accused leaders of the firm of running a more than $1 billion fraud. The six men pleaded not guilty to criminal and civil charges. However, Schwartz and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff working on the case have  differing views  on how best to liquidate Platinum's portfolio, according to a letter he sent on Friday to Brooklyn federal court Chief Judge Dora Irizarry, announcing his intention to resign as Platinum's receiver. Irizarry would need to approve his resignation. Schwartz has been trying to unwind roughly 100 complicated and difficult-to-sell investments, aiming to potentially return hundreds of millions of dollars to investors and creditors. Putting more money into some of the investments could boost their value over the long term, allowing for higher redemptions, Schwartz wrote. However, SEC employees believe the underlying companies are too risky to put more money into, and want to sell the assets as quickly as possible to minimize costs, he said. SEC staffers are concerned about Schwartz’s relationship with an unnamed law firm that is now a debtor to the Platinum estate, according to the letter. However, Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor, said it was not an issue.  My prior involvement with this firm did not have any effect on my actions as receiver nor did it negatively affect my ability to attempt to recover assets,  he wrote. Spokesmen for Schwartz and the SEC declined to comment. The SEC has already consented to his resignation and plans to suggest a new receiver if Irizarry approves the change. Platinum was the subject of a Reuters investigation published in April 2016 that highlighted its many complicated and illiquid investments in controversial companies. (reut.rs/2sJ4OPU) An April status report said that the assets under Schwartz's purview were worth more than $600 million. That number, however, was based on calculations by Platinum's own staff and the December charges involved inflating asset values. The receiver, with the help of an outside expert, has been independently assessing the value of the Platinum Partners Credit Opportunities Fund and the Platinum Partners Liquid Opportunity Fund. In February, Schwartz found there had not been a  major shift  from Platinum's estimates of the portfolio's value since an initial review following his appointment in December.   Platinum's largest group of funds, Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage, is being wound down under the supervision of a Cayman Islands-based liquidator. Platinum represented the gross value of its funds to be $1.7 billion at the time of the criminal charges.

May secured the backing of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and its 10 lawmakers, concluding two weeks of talks since she lost her majority in an election on June 8.  The pound hit a one-week high against the dollar of $1.2759 in morning London trade in anticipation of the deal, before briefly turning negative an hour before the announcement. After news broke of the deal being finalised, sterling reclaimed lost ground and last traded 0.1 percent higher at $1.2735. GBP=D3 It was also 0.1 percent higher at 87.97 pence per euro. EURGBP=D3  There wasn't really an expectation for it (the deal) to fall apart,  said Christopher Beauchamp, markets analyst at IG Markets, explaining the move.  In rather heavily trailed events, it (sterling) always tends to see that kind of unimpressed reaction.  Sterling has recovered more than a cent of its losses since the election as investors have upped their expectations for a rise in record low interest rates in Britain. A British pound note is seen in front of a stock graph in this November 7, 2016 picture illustration. Picture taken November 7.Dado Ruvic/IllustrationMore Bank of England policymakers than forecast voted for a hike at its last policy meeting, and its chief economist said last week that he expected to vote for a hike later this year. However, economic data in the coming weeks was likely to stay the Bank's hand on rates, said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.  We're a bit less optimistic and think the data will continue on a slowing path ahead of the August meeting where the bank may stick to the status quo and all these hawkish expectations fade away,  he said. Patel's comments chimed with those of strategists' at UBS, who argued Britain's current account was likely to be a greater driver for sterling in the medium-term versus the BoE's shifting stance towards rates.  Improvements in the income balance have been mostly driven by global asset reflation and not recent sterling weakness. If these improvements stick, then the downside for the pound may be less than what we thought before, other things equal,  they wrote in a note.  But equally, if they don't, then even more sterling weakness is likely required for the current account to revert to more sustainable levels.   Data on first-quarter economic output, a consumer confidence survey, business investment numbers and a reading of Britain's current account are all due later this week.

The European Commission's case was triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals, leading to a seven-year-long investigation into the world's most popular internet search engine. The EU competition authority charged Google in April 2015 with distorting internet search results to favor its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission declined to comment. Google said:  We continue to engage constructively with the European Commission and we believe strongly that our innovations in online shopping have been good for shoppers, retailers and competition.  FILE PHOTO: A Google logo is seen in a store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 24, 2017.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoThe company has said regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon (AMZN.O) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O). Reuters exclusively reported on June 1 that the EU competition enforcer aimed to sanction the company before the summer break in August. Companies found guilty of infringing EU antitrust rules can be fined as much as 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google's case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover but it is not expected to reach this level. A 1.06 billion euro fine handed down to U.S. chipmaker Intel in 2009 is the highest to date. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The Commission's tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop  scraping  reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products.

Responding to pressure from governments in Europe and the United States after a spate of militant attacks, the companies said they will share technical solutions for removing terrorist content, commission research to inform their counter-speech efforts and work more with counter-terrorism experts. The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism  will formalise and structure existing and future areas of collaboration between our companies and foster cooperation with smaller tech companies, civil society groups and academics, governments and supra-national bodies such as the EU and the UN,  the companies said in a statement. The move comes on the heels of last week's call from European heads of state for tech firms to establish an industry forum and develop new technology and tools to improve the automatic detection and removal of extremist content. The political pressure on the companies has raised the prospect of new legislation at EU level, but so far only Germany has proposed a law fining social media networks up to 50 million euros ($56 million) if they fail to remove hateful postings quickly. The lower house of the German parliament is expected to vote on the law this week. The companies will seek to improve technical work such as a database created in December to share unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos of extremist content. They will also exchange best practices on content detection techniques using machine learning as well as define  standard transparency reporting methods for terrorist content removals.  Earlier this month Facebook opened up about its efforts to remove terrorism content in response to criticism from politicians that tech giants are not doing enough to stop militant groups using their platforms for propaganda and recruiting. Google announced additional measures to identify and remove terrorist or violent extremist content on its video-sharing platform YouTube shortly thereafter. The social media firms said they would work with smaller companies to help them tackle extremist content and organisations such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies to work on ways to counter online extremism and hate. All four companies have initiatives to counter online hate speech and will use the forum to improve their efforts and train civil society organisations engaged in similar work.

At an informal debate among EU energy ministers, Germany's partners in the 28-nation bloc spoke out against Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline plan to pump more gas directly from Russia's Baltic coast to Germany. EU nations are expected to vote in the autumn on the European Commission's request for a mandate to negotiate with Russia on behalf of the bloc as a whole. Germany, the main beneficiary of the pipeline, sees it as a purely commercial project, with Chancellor Angela Merkel last week saying she saw no role for the Commission. The plan taps into divisions among the bloc over doing business with Russia, which covers a third of the EU's gas needs, despite sanctions against Moscow over its military intervention in Ukraine. In private, EU officials say they hope direct talks with Moscow would delay the project past 2019, depriving Russian state gas exporter Gazprom of leverage in talks over transit fees for Ukraine, the current route for most gas supplies to Europe. Germany, Austria and France - which have firms partnering with Gazprom on the project - declined to take the floor on Monday, EU diplomats said.  We had 13 delegations intervening, with all of them being supportive of the Commission's approach,  Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic told Reuters by telephone after presenting the EU executive's case to member states.  I am definitely optimistic about getting the mandate, but I know this is just the beginning of the debate.  The Commission found support from Italy as well as Nordic, Eastern European and Baltic states, EU sources told Reuters.  Germany has commercial interests, but it needs to explain itself,  one senior EU official said. With the pipeline expected to reroute some Russian gas supplies around Ukraine to the north, Italy voiced concerns it would increase gas prices for customers further down the line. Eastern European and Baltic states fear it will increase their dependence on Gazprom and undercut Ukraine. Nordic nations, meanwhile, have security concerns over the pipeline being laid near their shores under the Baltic Sea, where Russia has bolstered its military presence. Demark, which is considering amending its laws to allow it to ban pipeline projects such as Nord Stream 2, welcomed the bid by EU regulators to make the pipeline subject to EU energy rules that prevent energy suppliers from dominating infrastructure.  I am very happy with the decision today that it now shall be examined,  Danish Energy Minister Lars Lilleholt told Reuters. 'Toxic Issue' However, many EU nations have yet to take a stand.  It is quite toxic. Many member states are quite wary of advertising their position,  one diplomat told Reuters. There are also differences among EU member states over what aims to pursue in potential talks with Russia. Poland, one of Nord Stream's most vocal opponents, called on EU nations to reach a common stance and to suspend granting permits for the project while the bloc deliberates.  It's even more important given that Russia is still subject to EU sanctions,  Poland's Deputy Energy Minister Michal Kurtyka said. Speaking in Paris on Monday, Ukraine's foreign minister told Reuters the draft EU proposal did not go far enough to secure guarantees from Russia, warning Nord Stream 2 would have  dangerous consequences  for the bloc. Adding to tensions is the threat of new U.S. sanctions on Russia that would penalise Western firms involved in Nord Stream 2: Uniper, Wintershall, Shell, OMV and Engie. Several EU diplomats said the measures proposed by the U.S. Senate have already backfired against their stated aim of bolstering European energy security.  It's a divisive measure,  one senior official said.  It's easy for the U.S. to go after Russian gas of course, they don't use it. ... We are trying to make the best of a bad thing by balancing the interest of different member states.

The AfD made big electoral gains last year, capitalizing on fears about Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door policy toward migrants but its support has roughly halved in the past 12 months due partly to a slowdown in refugee arrivals. The party has also been dogged by an internal power struggle and disagreements over how to deal with members who have used neo-Nazi language or adopted some arguments put forward by the ultra-rightist National Democratic Party (NPD). Andre Poggenburg, AfD head in the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt, shocked many Germans by sending messages in a WhatApp group of AfD members saying  Germany for the Germans , a slogan often used by the NPD. Poggenburg has acknowledged the comments, and last week sent a tweet saying,  Why could this put pressure on me? Of course 'Germany belongs to the Germans' and it should remain so.   In a warning to Poggenburg, the AfD party board said the comments  massively damaged the image of the party in an election year , according to a spokesman. The board also cited comments in the chat group about expanding Germany's borders which, it said, gave the impression of  pushing the party toward right-wing radicalism . Germany lost eastern territory to Poland and Russia when the Nazi regime was defeated in World War Two, something that fringe far rightists in Germany have never accepted. In January, the AfD disciplined Bjoern Hoecke, the party's chief in the eastern state of Thuringia, for criticizing the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, but they stopped short of expelling him.  Also hanging over the party is an attempt by prosecutors to lift the parliamentary immunity of AfD leader Frauke Petry as part of a perjury investigation over statements she gave about the financing of the AfD's 2014 Saxony state election campaign.

Another was pushed into a drain. Most have been pepper-sprayed, tear-gassed, beaten and hit by pellet shots. A group of young Venezuelan lawmakers has risen to prominence on the violent front line of anti-government marches that have shaken the South American country for three months, bringing 75 deaths.  On the streets daily leading demonstrators, pushing at security barricades and sometimes picking up teargas canisters to hurl back at police and soldiers, the energetic National Assembly members are heroes to many opposition supporters.   But to President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government, they are the chief  terrorists  in a U.S.-backed coup plot aimed at controlling the vast oil wealth of the OPEC nation. The dozen or so legislators, all in their late 20s or early 30s, belong mainly to the Justice First and Popular Will parties, which are promoting civil disobedience against a president they term a dictator.  They march largely without protective gear - unlike the masked and shield-bearing youths around them - though supporters and aides sometimes form circles to guard them.  They do not receive salaries since funds to the National Assembly were squeezed, living instead off gifts from relatives and friends. And some still reside at home with parents. One of the best known, Juan Requesens, 28, has taken more hits than most. He nurses a scar in the head from a stick thrown by government supporters, wounds around his body from pellets and gas cannisters and bruises from being shoved into a deep drain by National Guard soldiers.   The worst thing for me is when comrades die, when they fall at my side,  the burly, bearded Requesens told Reuters, saying he had been near nine fatalities since April. Protesters have been demanding a presidential vote and solutions to hunger and medical shortages. The deaths have included not only demonstrators, but also Maduro supporters, bystanders and members of the security forces.  There have been thousands of injuries too, and nearly 1,500 people remain behind bars, according to local rights groups, after roundups around the country. Requesens, who represents western Tachira State where there is radical opposition to Maduro, freely admits his role as an  agitator  for the opposition. But despite his tough image, he obeyed his mother's order to stay at home after the head injury.  For four days, she wouldn't let me go out - but it was fine because I rested and recovered quicker, then back again of course,  he said. Some have dubbed the band of lawmakers  the class of 2007  for their roots in a student movement a decade ago that helped the opposition to a rare victory against Maduro's popular predecessor Hugo Chavez in a referendum.  It's a group born in the street during the 2007 protests. We're meeting up again 10 years later doing the same,  said Harvard-educated Juan Mejia, 31. FILE PHOTO: (L-R) Deputies of the opposition parties Carlos Paparoni, Jose Manuel Olivares and Juan Andres Mejias shout slogans during a march to state Ombudsman's office in Caracas, Venezuela May 29, 2017.Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File Photo Existential Struggle  Mejia, lawmaker for Miranda State, which includes part of the capital Caracas, has lost one friend in a protest and another in an accident on the way to a march.  For us, this is an existential struggle,  he added, saying his generation grew up under socialist rule and was fed up with economic hardship, crime and political repression.  I'm 31 and I'd like to live off my work, but I can't ... I don't want to depend on my parents all my life,  he added in a hotel where opposition politicians were strategizing during a brief lull in their daily street activities. Officials accuse the lawmakers of paying youths and even children as young as 12 to attack security forces, block roads and burn property. They have threatened to jail them. Slideshow (6 Images)State airlines refuse to sell them tickets, and private carriers are under pressure to do the same, meaning they cannot fly around the country, the lawmakers say. Some have also had passports confiscated or annulled, blocking foreign travel. In a typical recent speech, Maduro blasted Freddy Guevara, a 31-year-old lawmaker who leads the Popular Will party in the absence of its jailed leader Leopoldo Lopez, as  Chucky  in reference to a murderous doll in a horror film. He also singled out Miguel Pizarro, 29, a drum-playing lawmaker with the Justice First party who recently wept at a news conference minutes after a 17-year-old was shot dead close to him during a protest in Caracas.  He puts on that dumb face and behind it, he's ordering them to kill and burn,  Maduro said.  Pizarro, you're listening to me; you'll carry this with you all your life.  The lawmakers scoff at that, saying they now carry the nation's dreams for change while an ever-more desperate Maduro is clinging to power against the majority's will.  Their mantra is peaceful protest, and indeed when marches have not been blocked - such as to a state TV office and the Catholic Church headquarters - there has been no trouble.  But some admit to tossing back gas cannisters or throwing the odd stone, and there has been criticism the legislators have not done enough to restrain violence within opposition ranks, from burning property to lynching someone. Jose Manuel Olivares, a 31-year-old lawmaker for coastal Vargas State, is a doctor and says his profession makes it all the more important to avoid violence. He recently required 12 stitches after being hit in the head by a tear gas cannister, and has often given first aid during clashes in the streets.     Yet he defends protesters' rights to  self-defense  and admits to wearing gloves to pick up gas cannisters.  If I'm surrounded by old people, adults or even my family, and teargas falls nears us, it's legitimate defense to throw it back. Stones? Yes. But stones against bullets ... The battle is disproportional,  he said.  I'm not saying we're martyrs ... but we're trying to give the best example we can, fighting for the country, saying 'Here I am, taking risks just like you and you'.

Less than a month ago she became the first top seed to lose in the French Open first round in the professional era when she was dumped out in Paris by 40th-ranked Ekaterina Makarova. That was the low point of a season that, despite spending much of it at the top of the WTA rankings, has been by her own admission a struggle. The 29-year-old said handling all the extra baggage that comes with being at the top of the tennis tree has been difficult. But she believes that with a whiff of the ocean and the grasscourts in her nostrils, she will enter Wimbledon refreshed and with the slate wiped clean.  Not the best half year,  Kerber, who will play Kristyna Pliskova in the second round of the Aegon International at Eastbourne after a first-round bye, told a news conference at a sun-drenched Devonshire Park on England's Sussex coast.  But I think I learned a lot during the last six months. It's something nice to be number one, of course, but there are much more expectations.  The off season was too short and I didn't have time to sit down and think about what I achieved,  she explained.  I need time to find a new motivation and set different goals. Kerber, who owns 10 career titles, has a mediocre 19-13 win-loss record this season and has reached only one final. Quite a contrast to last year when she won the Australian Open and U.S. Open, reached the Wimbledon final and knocked Serena Williams off the summit. She will do well to hang on to the number one ranking post Wimbledon, but she says she has stopped worrying about rankings and points -- instead just focusing on playing her top tennis.  Right now I am really not thinking too much about the rankings, the points or whatever. Right now I'm really trying to focus again more on my tennis, trying to improve my tennis.  I took the wildcard for Eastbourne and it's great to be feeling the grass again, and I'm happy the clay court season is already finished.  At least she is feeling fit having recovered from a thigh injury and spending some time in the Mallorca sunshine, practicing on the grasscourts of Santa Ponsa before switching to the Victorian seaside town of Eastbourne.  I'm feeling good,  she said.  Just having the positive mood to going on court and fighting.

Food is the biggest driver of inflation in the East African nation, which exported more than 1.5 million tonnes of cereals to neighbours in 2016, the agriculture ministry has estimated. Government officials have also previously warned that, with the trade largely unregulated, food exports were causing shortages in the local market and threatened to drive up the rate of inflation even further.  From today onwards, it is strictly prohibited for anyone to export food crops,  Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said in a statement, adding the move aimed at  encouraging the construction of (food processing) industries in the country,   Anyone who is arrested trying to smuggle food out of the country will have both his consignment and the vehicle used in the smuggling operation nationalised,  he added. Tanzania's inflation rate slowed to 6.1 percent year-on-year in May from 6.4 percent a month earlier, but remains higher than the country's mid-term target of 5 percent. Despite producing around 3 million tonnes of surplus food in the 2015/16 harvest season, officials say unregulated exports have dwindled food reserves in a nation struggling with drought. In February, the government said over 1 million Tanzanians were facing food shortages in the country of over 50 million. In a report, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said drought in East Africa has sent prices of staples such as maize and sorghum soaring in the region, reaching record and near-record levels in parts of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania. The body said crops in East Africa had been depleted by drought exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon that ended last year, and poor and erratic rainfall in recent months.

Italy began winding up two failed Veneto region banks on Sunday in a deal that could cost taxpayers up to 17 billion euros but puts an end to a long-running crisis and leaves the lenders' good assets in the hands of Intesa Sanpaolo.  The announcement of definitive steps to resolve the two Veneto banks should be seen as a positive for Italian banks and the broader sector (albeit at a high cost),  said Jefferies analyst Benjie Creelan-Sandford.  Intesa, as acquirer of the 'good' assets, also looks to be getting a good deal,  he added. Shares in Intesa, Italy's largest retail bank, rose 3.5 percent while the euro zone bank index rose 1.1 percent. Gains in bank stocks helped the pan-European STOXX 600 and the euro zone blue chip indexes end 0.4 and 0.5 percent higher respectively, while the UK's FTSE added 0.3 percent. Further supporting sentiment was a survey showing that German business confidence unexpectedly rose in June to a record high, a fresh sign that company executives are more upbeat about the growth outlook of Europe's largest economy. The German blue chip index gained 0.3 percent. Nestle led STOXX gainers, up 4.3 percent. Activist investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point unveiled a stake of more than 1 percent, urging the group to improve its margins, buy back stock and sell its stake in L'Oreal. UBS said that despite its scale, Nestle lagged its rivals in profitability and that the move could put pressure on its CEO to take tangible steps to accelerate value creation. L'Oreal rose around 4 percent. Gains in Nestle also gave a lift to sector peers such as Danone and Diageo, sending the European food and beverage index up 2 percent. Higher oil prices propped up the energy sector, the worst performing this year, though the sector gave up earlier gains to end broadly flat as oil prices steadied. European tech stocks came under pressure, however, down 0.5 percent following a 3.7 percent fall in Dialog Semiconductor, which dropped after a media report cited comments from the chipmaker's CEO that the group is looking for larger acquisitions to reduce its reliance on Apple. William Hill was another sizeable faller, down 4.4 percent following a downbeat broker note.

Income inequality has grown among euro zone countries since the global financial crisis and some measures also show divergence between the bloc's richer and poorer members, a source of tension for the 19-member currency bloc.  Is this a seriously destabilising factor that we should cope with?  Draghi said in a rare town-hall style meeting with university students in Lisbon.  Yes it is.   We have to fight against inequality,  Draghi in response to a student question. Draghi, leading one of Europe's most respected institutions, has for years called on governments to enact fundamental reforms, arguing that the ECB is able to prop up growth, but only temporarily, giving governments a window of opportunity. Eurostat data has shown that only a handful of countries have managed to shrink income inequality since the crisis while it has grown sharply in places like France or Spain. Figures also show the highest level of income inequality in the bloc's periphery, like Greece, Spain and Portugal, hit hardest by the crisis. Calling convergence among euro zone members  fundamental,  Draghi said the best way to fight inequality is by creating jobs, which comes from an increased investment in education, skills development and innovation. He also called on governments to consider better income and wealth redistribution policies. Defending the ECB's ultra easy monetary policy, Draghi said that super low rates create jobs, foster growth and benefit borrowers, ultimately easing inequality. He also rejected calls to exit super easy monetary policy quickly, arguing that premature tightening would lead to a fresh recession and more inequality.

Among other base metals, lead reached its highest in nearly eight weeks and zinc moved back towards Friday's 11-week peak as on-warrant London Metal Exchange stocks -- metal not earmarked for delivery and therefore available to the market -- hit their lowest in nearly a decade. Copper remained under pressure, however.  You could argue that the durable goods orders are playing their part in this,  Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann said. The metal is still holding near Friday's peak of $5,854.50, its highest since April 7, and is up nearly 5 percent in the year to date, supported by major outages at copper mines in Chile and Indonesia and hopes for buoyant demand.  We've had some reasonably good data on the demand front out of China in terms of state power grid authorisations, better automobile production, a stable housing market,  Societe Generale analyst Robin Bhar.  At the same time you've had supply concerns returning.  * LME COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper closed at $5,794 a tonne, down 0.1 percent after a 1 percent gain in the previous session. * DURABLE GOODS: New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell unexpectedly in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter. * COPPER STOCKS: Copper inventories in London Metal Exchange warehouses MCU-STOCKS fell another 4,025 tonnes on Friday, exchange data showed, and are now down nearly 100,000 tonnes, or 28 percent, from their early May peak. * POSITIONING: Hedge funds and money managers cut their net long position in copper futures and options by 13,552 contracts to 49,285 in the week to June 20, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. * ZINC STOCKS: Zinc inventories in LME warehouses MZN-STOCKS fell to their lowest since early 2009 at 301,175 tonnes, exchange data showed, while on-warrant stocks hit their lowest since late 2007 at 81,150 tonnes. * ZINC AND LEAD: LME zinc closed 0.6 percent up at $2,719 a tonne, off Friday's peak of $2,747, its highest since April 7. Lead ended the day 1.1 percent up at $2,255, having earlier hit its highest since May 3 at $2,258.50. * ZINC SPREAD: The discount of the cash contract in LME zinc over the three-month contract has narrowed to zero, exchange data showed, suggesting a tighter LME market. * OTHER METALS: LME aluminium finished 0.2 percent down at $1,862 a tonne, while tin closed with a 0.3 percent gain at $19,290 and nickel slipped by 0.5 percent to $9,035.

An alliance of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the anti-immigrant Northern League won 55 percent of the votes in Genoa, the northern port city that was a left-wing stronghold but which the right will now govern for the first time in more than five decades. PD leader Matteo Renzi, who has been seeking to make a comeback since stepping down as prime minister in December, was the clear loser in Sunday's vote, though polls show his party is still one of Italy's most popular nationally.   It could have gone better,  Renzi said in an early-morning Facebook post.  The overall result isn't great. Some losses hurt, starting with Genoa and L'Aquila,  he said, referring to another former left-wing bastion city that fell to the right on Sunday. Four-time Prime Minister Berlusconi hailed victory.  The center-right is the largest coalition in the country,  he said in a statement. The results set the stage for the coalition  to get to work on the decisive challenge of returning to govern the country,  he said.  The center-left has governed Italy for four years, during which time the economy grew by only half the euro zone average. Three different PD premiers have struggled to shore up a banking system strangled by bad loans, and to manage half a million migrants who came by boat from North Africa. Beach or Ballot At 46 percent, turnout was very low by Italian standards, with many of the 4.3 million eligible voters probably choosing to go to the beach on the sweltering summer Sunday rather than the ballot box. Northern League's leader Matteo Salvini smiles during a news conference in Milan, Italy, June 26, 2017.Alessandro GarofaloSunday's vote -- the second round for cities where no one candidate won more than 50 percent two weeks ago -- is one of the last before a general election due by the end of May 2018, but it may not be a reliable indicator of what will happen then. The first-past-the-post voting system used at the municipal level, which favors coalitions, may not be replicated at a national level, where a proportional system is now in place.  But Sunday's result could help unite center-right parties which are in competition nationally. Their strong showing suggests if they come together under a single leader they would be a force to be reckoned with at the general election. Slideshow (9 Images)The center-right triumphed in 15 of the largest cities in Sunday's run-off, including Verona, Monza, Como, Piacenza and Pistoia, compared with four for the center-left.   Overall, the center-right won 79 cities over both rounds of voting, gaining control of 25 new cities, while the center-left won 76, losing 30 administrations, Forza Italia spokeswoman Deborah Bergamini said.   We knew the winds had shifted,  Bergamini told Reuters.  This is a major setback for the PD.  Genoa is the latest of a string of defeats in the PD's traditional strongholds. Last year it lost Turin, Italy's fourth-largest city, and the capital Rome, both to the 5-Star Movement, which was only founded eight years ago. 5-Star, which opinion polls say is slightly more popular than the PD nationwide, performed very badly in the first round of voting on June 11 and made the run-off in only one of the 25 largest cities. It added eight mayors to its modest tally.  We now have 45 mayors, up from 37 before, which is an increase of 20 percent,  5-Star founder Beppe Grillo said on his blog.  Every damned election we are growing and that is what counts.  The northern city of Parma went to the incumbent mayor who was elected as 5-Star's first ever mayor in 2012, but ran as an independent after falling out with the movement's leadership.

The two - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s (GS.N) private equity arm and Canada's Onex Corp (ONEX.TO) - are undertaking due diligence checks, the sources said. A consortium of buyout firm CVC Capital Partners and Japanese conglomerate Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) had withdrawn its offer, as had Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), the sources said. A first round of bids for Landis+Gyr, for which bankers are preparing debt packages of around $1 billion or 5-6 times its $200 million EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), closed in May and binding offers are expected in July. Goldman Sachs and Landis+Gyr declined to comment. CVC declined to comment, while Hitachi and Onex were not immediately available for comment.  Toshiba is also preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) of Landis if final bids fall short of its expectations, as the Japanese company scrambles to raise funds to cover massive losses at U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse.     Toshiba hired UBS this year for the deal and later added Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan to help with the potential IPO. CVC and Hitachi, whose initial preemptive offer of almost $2 billion to buy Landis+Gyr was declined, as well as Honeywell decided not to pursue deals due to the likely valuation and the prospects of a listing, the sources said. One of the sources said the company was aiming for offers 12 times EBITDA, which deterred many bidders. There has been a wave of M&A; activity in the metering industry. CVC is selling German metering and energy management group Ista, which could be worth up to 4.5 billion euros, while German metering group Techem could be put up for sale this year. Toshiba bought Landis+Gyr in 2011 for $2.3 billion jointly with state-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, which holds the remaining 40 percent in the company. Landis+Gyr, in which Toshiba has a 60 percent stake, employs more than 5,700 staff and is active in over 30 countries.

Trump,Jack Phillips,Neil Gorsuch,USA,COURT/BAKER (UPDATE 3,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide a major case on whether business owners can refuse to service gay couples if they oppose same-sex marriage on religious grounds involving a Christian baker in Colorado who declined to make a wedding cake for two men. The court took up an appeal by Jack Phillips, a baker who runs Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, just outside Denver, of a state court ruling that his refusal violated a Colorado anti-discrimination law. Phillips contends the law violated his rights to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. The dispute is one of several similar cases around the United States pressed by Christian conservatives who object to gay marriage and argue they should not be forced to violate their religious beliefs by providing certain services to same-sex couples. The U.S. Supreme Court's action came after Republican President Donald Trump's appointee Neil Gorsuch joined the court on April 10, restoring its 5-4 conservative majority. In prior cases, Gorsuch has embraced an expansive view of religious rights. The court will hear the case in its next term, which begins in October. The legal fight broke out in 2012 when Phillips told gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig that due to his Christian beliefs, his store's policy was to deny service to customers wanting to purchase cakes to celebrate a same-sex wedding. The two men married in Massachusetts but wanted to celebrate their nuptials with friends in Colorado. At the time, Colorado allowed civil unions but not marriage between same-sex couples. The U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide in 2015. Mullins described being denied service as offensive and dehumanizing. The American Civil Liberties Union in 2012 filed a complaint on behalf of Mullins and Craig, saying Phillips had violated Colorado state law barring businesses from refusing service based on race, sex, marital status or sexual orientation. The Colorado Civil Rights Commission found that Phillips had violated the measure and ordered him to take remedial measures including comprehensive staff training and the filing of quarterly compliance reports. In August 2015, the Colorado Court of Appeals also ruled against Phillips. The Colorado Supreme Court subsequently refused to hear the case, prompting Phillips to appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. 'More Than a Cake'  This has always been about more than a cake. Businesses should not be allowed to violate the law and discriminate against us because of who we are and who we love,  Mullins said on Monday. Phillips' argument hinges in part on whether baking cakes should be classified as a creative act that touches upon his beliefs, touching on his free speech rights, or whether it is more akin to selling a product like toilet paper or shampoo. Phillips has said that if he were required to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple it would constitute coerced speech. Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative Christian legal group representing Phillips, said the lower court ruling needs to be reversed.  It imperils everyone's freedom by crushing dissent instead of tolerating a diversity of views. We are all at risk when government is able to punish citizens like Jack just because it doesn't like how he exercises his artistic freedom,  said David Cortman, the group's senior counsel. In 2014, the Supreme Court declined to consider whether a New Mexico photography company had free speech grounds to refuse to photograph the commitment ceremony of a same-sex couple, leaving in place a ruling against the company. Such disputes in which conservative Christians who oppose gay marriage seek exemption from nondiscrimination laws increased after the Supreme Court's gay marriage decision. Twenty-two states have anti-discrimination laws that, in some form, protect gay people. In other so-called religious conscience cases, the Supreme Court has on two recent occasions ruled on Christian objections to the contraception coverage requirement that was part of the Obamacare health law. In 2014, the court ruled that Christian business owners could seek an exemption from the requirement. Two years later, the court sidestepped a similar case concerning Christian nonprofit organizations. It sent the cases back to lower courts for further proceedings.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-baker-idUSL1N1JN0GZ"},

The two - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s (GS.N) private equity arm and Canada's Onex Corp (ONEX.TO) - are undertaking due diligence checks, the sources said. A consortium of buyout firm CVC Capital Partners and Japanese conglomerate Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) had withdrawn its offer, as had Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), the sources said. A first round of bids for Landis+Gyr, for which bankers are preparing debt packages of around $1 billion or 5-6 times its $200 million EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), closed in May and binding offers are expected in July. Goldman Sachs and Landis+Gyr declined to comment. CVC declined to comment, while Hitachi and Onex were not immediately available for comment.  Toshiba is also preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) of Landis if final bids fall short of its expectations, as the Japanese company scrambles to raise funds to cover massive losses at U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse.     Toshiba hired UBS this year for the deal and later added Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan to help with the potential IPO. CVC and Hitachi, whose initial preemptive offer of almost $2 billion to buy Landis+Gyr was declined, as well as Honeywell decided not to pursue deals due to the likely valuation and the prospects of a listing, the sources said. One of the sources said the company was aiming for offers 12 times EBITDA, which deterred many bidders. There has been a wave of M&A; activity in the metering industry. CVC is selling German metering and energy management group Ista, which could be worth up to 4.5 billion euros, while German metering group Techem could be put up for sale this year. Toshiba bought Landis+Gyr in 2011 for $2.3 billion jointly with state-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, which holds the remaining 40 percent in the company. Landis+Gyr, in which Toshiba has a 60 percent stake, employs more than 5,700 staff and is active in over 30 countries.

The blue chip FTSE index was up 0.3 percent at 7,446.80 points at its close, paring back its earlier gains slightly as energy shares eased. Financials provided the biggest boost to the FTSE, adding 11.5 points to the index, with heavyweight banks HSBC and Barclays both up 1.2 percent. Banking stocks were in demand in Europe after a deal to wind up two failed Italian regional lenders. While earlier gains among oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell helped underpin the market, both heavyweights saw gains ease as the price of oil steadied.  Gains in (the) energy sector remain fragile as oil prices remain relatively soft compared to last month's levels,  Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said. She said investors were also awaiting for the Bank of England Financial Stability Report and Governor Mark Carney's speech on Tuesday for clues about any possible hike in interest rates as inflationary pressures rise. The news that British Prime Minister Theresa May had struck a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party had little impact on the internationally facing FTSE 100 index, though sterling ticked higher. While a drop among materials stocks weighed on British mid caps, which ended the session flat, outsourcer Capita was among standout movers. Its shares rose 2 percent after agreeing to sell its asset management services arm in a 888 million pounds deal that Jefferies said should help subside balance sheet concerns. Back on the FTSE, subprime lender Provident Financial fell 1.7 percent as RBC downgraded the stock to  Sector Perform  from  Outperform  following last week's profit warning. On the up were Nestle rivals Unilever and Diageo, as the sector was lifted after activist investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point urged the Swiss food giant to improve its margins, buy back stock and sell non-core assets. Top losers were precious metal miners Fresnillo and Randgold, which declined 3.1 and 1.5 percent respectively after gold prices fell as investors remained cautious ahead of a flurry of U.S. data due this week.

May secured the backing of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and its 10 lawmakers, concluding two weeks of talks since she lost her majority in an election on June 8.  The pound hit a one-week high against the dollar of $1.2759 in morning London trade in anticipation of the deal, before briefly turning negative an hour before the announcement.

EURGBP=D3  There wasn't really an expectation for it (the deal) to fall apart,  said Christopher Beauchamp, markets analyst at IG Markets, explaining the move.  In rather heavily trailed events, it (sterling) always tends to see that kind of unimpressed reaction.  Sterling has recovered more than a cent of its losses since the election as investors have upped their expectations for a rise in record low interest rates in Britain.

Picture taken November 7.Dado Ruvic/IllustrationMore Bank of England policymakers than forecast voted for a hike at its last policy meeting, and its chief economist said last week that he expected to vote for a hike later this year. However, economic data in the coming weeks was likely to stay the Bank's hand on rates, said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.  We're a bit less optimistic and think the data will continue on a slowing path ahead of the August meeting where the bank may stick to the status quo and all these hawkish expectations fade away,  he said. Patel's comments chimed with those of strategists' at UBS, who argued Britain's current account was likely to be a greater driver for sterling in the medium-term versus the BoE's shifting stance towards rates.  Improvements in the income balance have been mostly driven by global asset reflation and not recent sterling weakness. If these improvements stick, then the downside for the pound may be less than what we thought before, other things equal,  they wrote in a note.  But equally, if they don't, then even more sterling weakness is likely required for the current account to revert to more sustainable levels.   Data on first-quarter economic output, a consumer confidence survey, business investment numbers and a reading of Britain's current account are all due later this week.

The court took up an appeal by Jack Phillips, a baker who runs Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, just outside Denver, of a state court ruling that his refusal violated a Colorado anti-discrimination law. Phillips contends the law violated his rights to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. The dispute is one of several similar cases around the United States pressed by Christian conservatives who object to gay marriage and argue they should not be forced to violate their religious beliefs by providing certain services to same-sex couples. The U.S. Supreme Court's action came after Republican President Donald Trump's appointee Neil Gorsuch joined the court on April 10, restoring its 5-4 conservative majority. In prior cases, Gorsuch has embraced an expansive view of religious rights.  The court will hear the case in its next term, which begins in October. The legal fight broke out in 2012 when Phillips told gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig that due to his Christian beliefs, his store's policy was to deny service to customers wanting to purchase cakes to celebrate a same-sex wedding.

Ex-Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, ousted from office in an election last November, will stand trial in U.S. District Court for defying a 2011 injunction that barred his deputies from stopping and detaining motorists solely on the suspicion of being in the country illegally. The controversial traffic stops continued for about 18 months despite the judge's order. The 85-year-old Republican lawman, who styled himself as  America’s toughest sheriff  during his 24 years in office and became a nationally known figure, faces up to six months in jail if convicted. Arpaio previously criticized then-President Barack Obama's Justice Department for what he said was playing politics and charging him so close to the election, vowing he would be cleared of any wrongdoing. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton will decide his fate after she rejected a request by Arpaio's lawyers for a jury trial. The proceedings are expected to take at least two weeks. Arpaio already has been cited by another judge for civil contempt for the continued traffic stops in the underlying profiling case. That judge found his office was guilty of racially profiling Latino drivers. The ex-sheriff has admitted to the civil contempt, but said his actions were inadvertent and not willful or intentional - standards that would need to be proved for a criminal prosecution. The criminal case was delayed for two months after Arpaio assembled a new defense team to combat what his attorneys have said was a prosecution based on his cooperation with federal efforts to combat illegal immigration. Several last-ditch appeals were made to postpone the trial, including Arpaio's most recent request for a change of venue. Arpaio's attorneys also have been trying to subpoena U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to testify on immigration policy. Several key rulings have preceded Monday's trial. Bolton has ruled that Arpaio's words in the media and elsewhere can be used against him in court and that two people who were stopped by deputies would be allowed to testify. It was not known if Arpaio would take the stand at the trial.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/arizona-arpaio-idUSL1N1JN0TN"},

More than 118 people were injured in the explosion in the eastern province of Punjab, which came as people gathered to collect leaking fuel after the tanker overturned on Sunday, government officials and rescue workers said. It was one of several deadly events to mar the run-up to Monday's Eid al-Fitr holiday at the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. At least 88 people died in Islamist militant bombings in two cities on Friday, including 75 in a market in the northwestern city of Parachinar. A burst tyre apparently caused the speeding fuel tanker to overturn on a sharp bend on a highway on the outskirts of the city of Bahawalpur, provincial spokesman Malik Muhammed Ahmed Khan said. It was not clear what triggered the fireball but on Sunday, a spokesman for rescue services said someone was believed to have lit a cigarette.  Rehabilitation and treatment of the victims is our top priority,  Khan said. Hospitals are also arranging DNA testing to identify the many bodies that were charred beyond recognition. At least 20 children are among the dead. Many of the burn victims have been moved to the larger cities of Karachi and Lahore. Governments hospital are often-underequipped and the ones in Bahawalpur and nearby Multan were set up only to handle small numbers, Khan said. The oil tanker driver, who survived, has been detained to assist in an investigation, but early reports do not indicate human error, Khan said. He said a separate investigation was underway to see why police did not disperse the crowds of people who gathered to collect fuel.  Police did try but we are looking into what went wrong,  he said. Prime Minister Sharif visited the injured in Bahawalpur's Victoria Hospital on Sunday after flying home from a trip to London, his office said.

The European Commission ended months of speculation over whether Italy would be able to bypass regulations preventing state bailouts of banks by granting approval for the deal. On Sunday, Italy began winding up two failed regional banks in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros ($19 billion). The rescue will see the lenders' good assets go to Italy's biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo. The Italian banking system is choked by a high level of bad loans and the prospect of some relief was enough for investors to buy up Italian bonds despite the additional borrowing such a rescue entails.  Negative consequences for the Italian state will be offset by the positive consequences for Italian government bonds in terms of reducing the already high uncertainty surrounding this issue,  BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche said. Indeed, after an initial spike in early trade, Italian government bonds were among the best performers on the day by noon. The yield on 10-year Italian debt dropped as much as 4 basis points to 1.87 percent, before edging back up to 1.90 percent as European trading drew to a close. Most other euro zone government yields were flat on the day.  There is the danger that other banks need state support, but I think there's more clarity now that there is a solution for the banking sector,  ING strategist Martin van Vliet said. Italy's bond yield spread over Germany see-sawed from 168 bps in early trade to 164 bps by midday. BBVA strategists believe that if the entire 17 billion euros is used, it would add about 1 percentage point to the country's debt as a percentage of its economic output. Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio is among the highest in the world at 132.6 percent at the end of 2016, according to EU data. Italy's economy minister said on Monday he did not expect other banks to need state aid. Also on Monday, Greece's 10-year borrowing costs dropped to their lowest since 2009 after Moody's upgraded its credit rating on Friday, with yields approaching levels at which Athens might consider returning to the bond market.

The court took up an appeal by Jack Phillips, a baker who runs Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, just outside Denver, of a state court ruling that his refusal violated a Colorado anti-discrimination law. Phillips contends the law violated his rights to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. The dispute is one of several similar cases around the United States pressed by Christian conservatives who object to gay marriage and argue they should not be forced to violate their religious beliefs by providing certain services to same-sex couples. The U.S. Supreme Court's action came after Republican President Donald Trump's appointee Neil Gorsuch joined the court on April 10, restoring its 5-4 conservative majority. In prior cases, Gorsuch has embraced an expansive view of religious rights.  The court will hear the case in its next term, which begins in October. The legal fight broke out in 2012 when Phillips told gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig that due to his Christian beliefs, his store's policy was to deny service to customers wanting to purchase cakes to celebrate a same-sex wedding. The two men married in Massachusetts but wanted to celebrate their nuptials with friends in Colorado. At the time, Colorado allowed civil unions but not marriage between same-sex couples. The U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide in 2015. Mullins described being denied service as offensive and dehumanizing. The American Civil Liberties Union in 2012 filed a complaint on behalf of Mullins and Craig, saying Phillips had violated Colorado state law barring businesses from refusing service based on race, sex, marital status or sexual orientation.  The Colorado Civil Rights Commission found that Phillips had violated the measure and ordered him to take remedial measures including comprehensive staff training and the filing of quarterly compliance reports. In August 2015, the Colorado Court of Appeals also ruled against Phillips. The Colorado Supreme Court subsequently refused to hear the case, prompting Phillips to appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. 'More Than a Cake'  This has always been about more than a cake. Businesses should not be allowed to violate the law and discriminate against us because of who we are and who we love,  Mullins said on Monday. Phillips' argument hinges in part on whether baking cakes should be classified as a creative act that touches upon his beliefs, touching on his free speech rights, or whether it is more akin to selling a product like toilet paper or shampoo. Phillips has said that if he were required to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple it would constitute coerced speech. Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative Christian legal group representing Phillips, said the lower court ruling needs to be reversed.  It imperils everyone's freedom by crushing dissent instead of tolerating a diversity of views. We are all at risk when government is able to punish citizens like Jack just because it doesn't like how he exercises his artistic freedom,  said David Cortman, the group's senior counsel. In 2014, the Supreme Court declined to consider whether a New Mexico photography company had free speech grounds to refuse to photograph the commitment ceremony of a same-sex couple, leaving in place a ruling against the company. Such disputes in which conservative Christians who oppose gay marriage seek exemption from nondiscrimination laws increased after the Supreme Court's gay marriage decision. Twenty-two states have anti-discrimination laws that, in some form, protect gay people. In other so-called religious conscience cases, the Supreme Court has on two recent occasions ruled on Christian objections to the contraception coverage requirement that was part of the Obamacare health law. In 2014, the court ruled that Christian business owners could seek an exemption from the requirement. Two years later, the court sidestepped a similar case concerning Christian nonprofit organizations. It sent the cases back to lower courts for further proceedings.

(NBG, RD/RD/ccc) and Piraeus Bank S.A. (Piraeus, RD/RD/ccc) as follows: - Alpha's mortgage covered bonds upgraded to 'B-' from 'CCC+'; Stable Outlook assigned - NBG's mortgage covered bonds Programme I (NBG I) affirmed at 'B-'; Outlook Stable - NBG's mortgage covered bonds Programme II (NBG II) affirmed at 'B-'; Outlook Stable - Piraeus's mortgage covered bonds affirmed at 'B-'; Outlook Stable The rating actions follow the upgrade of the Viability Ratings (VR) of Alpha, NBG and Piraeus to 'ccc' from 'f' on 19 June 2017 (see Fitch Affirms Greek Banks' IDRs at RD; Upgrades VRs available at www.fitchratings.com) and the full periodic review of the programmes. KEY RATING DRIVERS Country Ceiling and VRs The ratings of the covered bonds issued under the programmes are capped by Greece's Country Ceiling of 'B-'. At the same time, the 'B-' represents the rating floor for the programmes resulting from the VRs, as adjusted by the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) uplifts, and it is achievable irrespective of the levels of over-collateralisation (OC). Following the upgrade of the banks' VRs to 'ccc' from 'f', the starting point for the analysis is the 'ccc' VR in accordance with Fitch's Covered Bonds Rating Criteria. IDR Uplift Greek covered bonds are eligible for a maximum IDR uplift of two notches. The unchanged IDR uplift of two notches reflects that the issuers' Long-Term IDRs are not support-driven (neither institutional nor by the sovereign) as well as a low risk of under-collateralisation at the point of resolution. This is based on Fitch's assessment on the Greek legal framework, the presence of an asset monitor, asset eligibility criteria and minimum legal and contractual levels of OC, as applicable. Payment Continuity Uplift (PCU) The PCU is unchanged for all the programmes: six notches for NBG I and eight notches for NGB II, Alpha's and Piraeus's programmes due to the structural mechanisms that are in place to protect against cash flow mismatches between assets and liabilities. While NBG I has a soft bullet amortisation profile of the liabilities with a 12-months principal maturity extension, NGB II, Alpha and Piraeus covered bonds envisage a conditional pass-through feature that implies the covered bonds can amortise in line with the cover assets upon the extension of their principal maturity date. Moreover, each programme includes a liquidity reserve that covers at least three-month interest due on the covered bonds and senior expenses. Recovery Uplift The covered bonds are eligible for a recovery uplift as they are secured by standard Greek residential mortgage loans and therefore capable of generating at least good recovery prospects. NBG I, NBG II and Piraeus's programme are assigned a three-notch recovery uplift as the 25% OC Fitch relies on compensates for credit losses modelled in a stress scenario corresponding to the covered bonds' rating (7%, 14% and 14.3%, respectively). Alpha programme is assigned a one-notch recovery uplift as its relied-upon OC of 5.26% does not offset the 8.4% credit loss in the 'B-' rating scenario. The PCU and recovery uplift assigned to each covered bond programme are not a driver of the covered bonds ratings, as they are constrained by the 'B-' sovereign Country Ceiling. ALPHA Alpha's covered bonds are rated 'B-', two notches above the bank's VR of 'ccc'. This is based on an unchanged IDR uplift of two notches, an unchanged PCU of eight notches and a recovery uplift of one notch. The maximum legal asset percentage (AP) of 95% (5.26% equivalent OC) which Fitch relies upon in its analysis is in line with the 'B-' breakeven AP. The agency has assigned a Stable Outlook to Alpha's covered bonds, reflecting a stable cover pool composition. NBG NBG I and NBG II covered bonds are rated 'B-', two notches above the bank's VR of 'ccc', based on an unchanged IDR uplift of two notches, an unchanged PCU of six and eight notches, respectively, and a recovery uplift of three notches. The 80% contractual AP of both programmes (25% equivalent OC) which Fitch relies upon in its analysis provides more protection than the 95% 'B-' breakeven AP. The Stable Outlook on the covered bonds reflects a stable cover pool composition and the cushion provided by the committed OC against the 95% 'B-' breakeven AP. PIRAEUS Piraeus' covered bonds are rated 'B-', two notches above the bank's VR of 'ccc'. This is based on an unchanged IDR uplift of two notches, an unchanged PCU of eight notches and a recovery uplift of three notches. The contractual AP of 80% which Fitch relies upon in its analysis provides more protection than the 95% 'B-' breakeven AP. The Stable Outlook on the covered bonds reflects a stable cover pool composition and the cushion provided by the committed OC against the 95% 'B-' breakeven AP. RATING SENSITIVITIES Changes in Greece's Country Ceiling could affect the rating of all Greek covered bonds programmes. In particular and all else being equal, a higher sovereign Country Ceiling would trigger an upgrade by one notch for all programmes, factoring in the good recovery prospects, irrespective of the level of Fitch's relied-upon over-collateralisation. If the Country Ceiling is upgraded by two notches or more, the covered bond ratings could be upgraded correspondingly as long as the relied-upon OC of each programme is enough to compensate for the stresses commensurated with the Country Ceiling level. Alpha Bank AE's covered bonds ratings are vulnerable to a one-notch downgrade if the bank's VR is downgraded to 'cc' or below, all else being equal.

From music production with Def Jam to clothing with the Phat Farm label, to consumer finance with RushCard or even his yoga studio Tantris, Simmons keeps popping up everywhere. For the latest in Reuters'  Life Lessons  series, Simmons, the brother of  Run-D.M.C.'s Reverend Run, sat down to talk about how he went from a modest boyhood in New York City to becoming a master of all trades. Q: Your parents were park and school administrators in Queens, New York, so what did they teach you about making a dollar stretch? A: They taught me to be frugal. My mother and father were both artists really in their hearts. Money was never primary in any of our choices for education or in life. They were very supportive of my brothers and myself. They pushed us to take the route that inspired us, rather than the one that produced the most money. Q: As co-founder of Def Jam, what did you learn about turning a cultural movement into a successful business? A: It's about faith and resilience. It's about quieting the mind and being more present. When I made a good record, the world moved slowly. When I listened to the record, I'd be engaged and fully awake and present. That is what we want in life: to be more present. Q: By expanding into other business lines, like clothing with Phat Farm, what lessons about entrepreneurship did you absorb? A: I've learned you have to have faith in your businesses. Hard work, determination, faith and resilience are the nucleus of success. This takes time, and people quit. But I've learned you can't fail until you quit. People want to see results, but as it says in the scripture, 'You have control over your work alone and never its fruit.' I've always had faith that it was a better path to enjoy the work, than count the results of that work. Q: How do you decide where you can have the most impact? FILE PHOTO: Russell Simmons arrives as a guest to the premiere of the new film  Lee Daniels' The Butler  in Los Angeles, California August 12, 2013.Fred ProuserA: I co-founded RushCard, a prepaid debit card company, almost 15 years ago. I wanted to empower those families who had been cut out of the modern banking economy. We helped pioneer the space. Prepaid cards are now a valuable, convenient financial tool for working-class, middle-class and affluent families who want an alternative to a checking account. I'm also the chairman of the Foundation of Ethnic Understanding, fighting anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, even though I'm not a Jew or a Muslim. It's because no one else is doing it. This is why I started my yoga studio, Tantris. It's a practice, not just exercise. I wanted to teach yoga and deliver those ancient scriptures in a way that's not esoteric, and make sure I give a full experience to promote ideas and a state of happiness and presence. Q: With your own portfolio, do you tend to prefer a particular asset class - stocks, bonds, real estate? A: I don't invest in any of those. I invest in triple-A convertible bonds. I don't really invest in any companies I don't have control over or support in some way. I'm only an investor in my own businesses. Q: How would you define success? A: Stable, lasting happiness. We get there through operating from a comfortable seat and having a quiet mind - the state of needing nothing. It is a practice, and you get there by being more compassionate, more giving and less anxious. It's about being more present - the more present we are, the happier we are. Q: Does your interest in yoga and spirituality help inform your decision-making in other aspects of your life? A: Every aspect of my life should be informed by yoga. I promote to anyone wanting to do business to sit still and meditate for 20 minutes one or two times a day. This is the key to creativity and good choices. Q: What lessons about life and money do you try to pass down to your kids? A: Don't waste any of God's resources. Money is small, but the idea to not be wasteful is big. Not to waste is a much, much greater lesson overall. Having a frugal attitude is what I'd like them to take away.

Trump,Edward Peruta,Neil Gorsuch,US,USA,COURT,GUNS,United States","sector":"News - Politics","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sidestepped one of the most hotly contested gun rights disputes in years, declining to rule in a California case on whether a person's constitutional right to keep firearms for self-defense extends outside the home.  Gun owners had taken aim at a California law that bars them from being granted a permit to carry a concealed gun in public places unless they show  good cause  for having it, with county sheriffs making the determination. The justices let stand a lower court's ruling upholding a San Diego County sheriff's policy of denying such permits unless the gun owner documents a need for self-defense. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the policy last year, finding that the U.S. Constitution offers no right to carry a concealed weapon.  Two conservative justices, including President Donald Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, said the court should have heard the case. The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment guarantees the right to  keep and bear arms.  In its landmark 2008 District of Columbia v. Heller ruling, the Supreme Court held for the first time that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual's right to bear arms for self-defense in the home. The California plaintiffs were aiming to extend that right outside the home. Conservative Supreme Court justices generally have been receptive to an expansive view of gun rights, with liberals skeptical. The court has five conservative justices, including Gorsuch, and four liberals. California law generally forbids the carrying of handguns, either open or concealed, in public spaces. Lead plaintiff Edward Peruta, a San Diego County resident, applied for a concealed carry license, but was rejected because he had not specifically shown he was in harm's way. Peruta and four others sued San Diego County in a case backed by a California affiliate of the National Rifle Association gun rights group. The state intervened in support of the county. The plaintiffs argued that the sheriff's definition of  good cause  violated the Second Amendment. Law-abiding citizens should be able to carry weapons in public for the general purpose of self-defense, the plaintiffs argued.  Last June, the appeals court ruled that the Second Amendment does not protect the right to carry concealed firearms in public.

The agreement between the Minnesota city and Valerie Castile, the victim's mother, comes a week after the officer who shot Castile, 32, five times was found not guilty of any crime - the bloody aftermath that was seen by millions of people after Castile's girlfriend livestreamed it online. Castile's death drew national attention, coming amid a wave of high-profile police killings of black men, which sparked street protests in cities across the United States. A jury of seven men and five women, 10 of whom were white and two black, last week acquitted St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez for his role in the killing. Yanez testified that he had feared for his life after Castile told him that he was carrying a firearm and reached for his wallet when Yanez asked to see identification. Diamond Reynolds, the girlfriend in the passenger seat who broadcast the aftermath of the shooting on Facebook Live, testified that Castile never reached for the handgun he was licensed to carry. Shortly after the verdict, the City of St. Anthony said Yanez, the son of a Mexican immigrant, would not return to active duty and it was negotiating a  voluntary separation agreement  with him.  I'm mad as hell right now,  Valerie Castile told reporters after the verdict.  My first-born son died. ... Just because he was a police officer, that makes it OK.  She said the verdict shows  the system continues to fail black people.  The family's attorney had said at the time it planned to file a civil lawsuit in federal court. Video footage of the fatal shooting from the dashboard camera of a police car showed how quickly the incident unfolded, but shed no light on whether Castile had reached for his gun. Prosecutors had argued Yanez was not justified in firing his gun, saying Castile was courteous and non-threatening. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the state capitol in St. Paul after the verdict, and a series of speakers demanded justice for minorities in the American judicial system and stronger accountability measures for police.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/minnesota-police-idUSL1N1JN0SK"},

Rio's mines in Australia's Hunter Valley region are attractive to both Glencore and China because the quality of their coal means it is likely to continue to be burned even as concerns about emissions deter generators from using poorer quality coal, which is the most polluting of all. Yancoal increased its offer to $2.69 billion from $2.45 billion, adding $240 million in unconditional guaranteed royalty payments to a cash offer of $2.45 billion.   The revised offer from Yancoal of $2.69 billion offers compelling value to our shareholders,  Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a statement.  Glencore on Friday had raised its offer to $2.675 billion in cash, looking to beat Yancoal's earlier offer of $2.45 billion.  Glencore said its bid would lapse if Rio Tinto did not declare it to be superior by June 26.  On Monday, it declined comment on Rio Tinto's decision to stick with Yancoal. Rio Tinto said Yancoal offered a faster and more certain timetable, with the deal likely to be wrapped up during the third quarter of 2017, compared with the first half of 2018 at the earliest for the Glencore deal.  The Rio Tinto mining company's logo is photographed at their annual general meeting in Sydney, Australia, May 4, 2017.Jason ReedYancoal also increased its termination fee, in the event a deal is not completed, to $225 million from $100 million.  Yancoal continues to provide Rio Tinto with the certainty of approvals and funding required to facilitate the efficient and timely sale of the Coal & Allied assets,  Yancoal Chairman Xiyong Li said in a statement. Yancoal, though based in Australia, is 78 percent owned by China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Company. The logo of commodities trader Glencore is pictured in front of the company's headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, September 30, 2015.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoThe sale includes a major stake in the Port Waratah coal-loading facility in Newcastle port, from where most of Australia's thermal coal departs for overseas markets. Both Glencore and Yancoal want to buy Rio Tinto's mines to operate alongside existing operations, looking to sell high quality thermal coal to power generators in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea that are under pressure to become more efficient and to lower emissions.  In raising its offer last week, Glencore said it would sell assets to ensure its debt level remained modest. Analyst Edward Sterck of BMO Capital Markets said if Glencore's higher bid had been accepted, it could reduce the company's flexibility to pursue its goal of expanding its agriculture business. Rio Tinto will now hold shareholder meetings on Tuesday in London and on Thursday in Sydney to allow shareholders to vote on the deal. Glencore's share price rose 0.5 percent by 1325 GMT, while Rio rose 1 percent.

In 2005, nearly 170,000 people lost their medical insurance after cuts to TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program. For the new study, researchers compared data from before and after that year, to see how long it took to diagnose and treat breast cancer in women living in low-income versus high-income zip codes in Tennessee. In low-income areas, where more residents were insured through Medicaid, the proportion of breast cancer cases diagnosed at a late stage when tumors had spread rose from 35.4 percent in 2002-2004 – before the Medicaid cuts – to 40.2 percent in 2006-2008, researchers note in the journal Cancer. “When women lose access to health insurance, they may be less likely to receive recommended mammograms and have access to regular primary care services that would facilitate an early diagnosis of cancer,” said senior study author Lindsay Sabik, a public health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. “A growing body of evidence shows that health insurance coverage, and Medicaid in particular, is associated with having a usual source of health care, access to primary care, and use of preventive services,” Sabik said by email.  The majority of the women in the study were white, married and insured. Researchers defined low-income zip codes as areas where at least half the residents had annual income of no more than $38,700 in 2005, equivalent to 200 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of four. In high-income zip codes, half of the people made more than that each year.  In the high-income areas, the proportion of breast cancer cases diagnosed at a late stage increased from 34.6 percent before the 2005 Medicaid cuts to 36.2 percent afterward, the study found.  There was a 3.3 percentage point increase in late-stage diagnosis for women living in low-income zip codes relative to women living in high-income zip codes. Both in poorer and more affluent areas, women were more likely to experience surgery and treatment delays after the Medicaid cuts, but the change was more pronounced in high-income zip codes.  The proportion of women who waited more than 60 days for surgery after their diagnosis rose from 12 percent before the cuts to 14.3 percent afterward in low-income areas, while it increased from 10.2 percent to 14.4 percent in high-income zip codes.  Limitations of the study include the lack of data on whether diagnosis and treatment delays translated into worse survival odds for women with breast cancer and the lack of data on how many women in the study actually lost Medicaid benefits as a result of the 2005 cuts, the authors note.  Still, the results have implications for other states considering Medicaid cuts, because treatment and diagnosis delays can make treatment more difficult and more expensive, the researchers argue.  Federal and state lawmakers are considering rollbacks of Medicaid expansions implemented under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, to save money or address fiscal shortfalls, Sujha Subramanian, a health economics and policy researcher at RTI International in Waltham, Massachusetts, writes in an accompanying editorial.  “Losing Medicaid coverage will have detrimental impact on cancer patients,” Subramanian said by email.  Survival odds are worse with later diagnosis, Subramanian said. When breast cancer is caught early, before tumors have spread, 98.9 percent of patients survive five years after diagnosis, but this drops to only 26.9 percent when malignancies have spread far beyond the breast.

The utility-scale solar industry, which accounts for more than half of U.S. installations, would be hit hardest if Washington adopts the hefty remedies sought by bankrupt solar panel maker Suniva. That is because large projects depend on being cost-competitive with natural gas-fired plants to spur buying, research firm GTM Research said in their analysis.  This is arguably one of the biggest downside risks to the future of U.S. solar,  GTM's associate director of U.S. solar, Cory Honeyman, said in an interview. In April, Suniva filed a rare Section 201 petition with the U.S. International Trade Commission nine days after seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In the petition, the company asked for new duties on imported solar products to combat a global glut of panels that has depressed prices and made it difficult for American producers to compete. FILE PHOTO: Solar installers from Baker Electric place solar panels on the roof of a residential home in Scripps Ranch, San Diego, California, U.S. on October 14, 2016.Mike Blake/File PhotoSuniva was founded in Georgia but as of 2015 is majority owned by Hong Kong-based Shunfeng International Clean Energy. It was joined in the petition by another domestic manufacturer, the U.S. division of Germany's SolarWorld. The German company filed for insolvency last month. Suniva is seeking a duty rate of 40 cents per watt on solar cells and a minimum price on modules of 78 cents a watt for the first year, levels unseen since 2012, according to GTM. Between 2018 and 2022, U.S. solar installations would fall from 72.5 gigawatts to 36.4 GW with a minimum module price of 78 cents a watt, GTM said. If a 40 cent cell tariff were implemented as well, installations would drop to 25 GW during the period. The U.S. ITC will decide by September whether imports are causing harm to domestic producers. If it does find serious injury to the industry, by November the commission will recommend remedies to President Trump, who then makes a final decision. Trump could accept the ITC's recommendation or do something else entirely. The final outcome could vary greatly from Suniva's suggested remedies. The Solar Energy Industries Trade Association, the U.S. solar trade group, is opposed to Suniva's petition. The group said last week that an estimated 88,000 jobs would be lost if the trade protections Suniva is seeking are imposed.

The ship, which measures 280 metres and can move 500 miles a day, took 11 tugs to manoeuvre out into the River Forth and then must wait for low tide so as to pass under the Forth's famous bridges - weather and systems checks permitting. It took eight years to build HMS Queen Elizabeth and along with its sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales, it is part of a defence programme worth 6 billion pounds ($7.65 billion), with building and fitting spread over six different shipyards across Britain. It will now spend around two years in sea trials.  Of course they are expensive, absolutely, it keeps us in the premier league among nations around the world,  Commanding Officer Captain Jerry Kyd told Sky News.  The fact is that they are not just ships, but sea bases able to do a whole range of functions and missions ... whether that's engaging with the enemy at long range or indeed supporting British industry abroad or perhaps even assisting with disaster relief or humanitarian aid.  The ship's navigator Jez Brettell compared handling the ship on its maiden voyage to taking out a brand new sports car before it had been road-tested.  The first time we put those levers forward will be the first time that we will have been under our own power and moving,  he told the BBC. It was scheduled to be fully operational by 2020 but that date may now be as late as 2026, Britain's National Audit Office said earlier this year, because of technical difficulties.

After years of cuts to defence budgets that have curbed demand for military equipment, including in Italy, Alessandro Profumo is looking to establish joint ventures with peers and seal more deals with higher spending countries. The 60-year old veteran banker, who is credited with turning Milan-based UniCredit into a pan-European player during his years as CEO, was appointed to the helm of state-controlled Leonardo by Italy's government in May. Giovanni Soccodato, Leonardo's head of strategy and development, said the group, among the top 10 companies by revenue in the global defence sector, aimed to expand in emerging markets, particularly those with deeper pockets and higher security demands, such as the Gulf or the Far East.  In coming years we will have to make strong decisions on where to position ourselves to grow further,  he told Reuters. Leonardo's hunt for new market opportunities comes after a three-year restructuring programme kick-started by Profumo's predecessor Mauro Moretti, who cut the group's debt by a third to 2.8 billion euros last year and streamlined its operations. Moretti was criticised for not winning big deals, and for not focusing outside of Italy, which accounted for more than 2 billion euros of total revenue of 12 billion euros last year. Europe represented 27 percent of sales and North America just under a quarter.  Leonardo has been static in the last years... it's been a long chain of lost opportunities,  an industry insider said. Rome is pushing Leonardo to open new headquarters in the United States, where it operates through subsidiary DRS, and to expand its UK offices in order to closely monitor any fallout from Brexit, a government source said. Unlike Moretti, tasked to focus on Leonardo's books and simplify its structure, Profumo was picked by the government to outline a broader and longer-term strategy for the group.  Profumo's mission is to make Leonardo a big international company again, opening it further to foreign markets and diversifying its clients in Italy,  a government source said. People familiar with the defence group said Profumo should help raise its profile after the firm's reputation was severely tarnished by a big corruption case over a 2010 helicopter deal in India, involving top managers before Moretti took over. Speaking at last week's Paris Air Show, his official debut as CEO, Profumo told Reuters that he was studying the company and sector in depth. The manager has given himself 100 days to set out key guidelines for the company. He will also focus on improving Leonardo's credit rating, currently one notch below investment-grade level with all three major rating agencies, people with knowledge of the matter said. That could include controlling costs and scaling down its portfolio of products, which range from helicopters to military aircraft, training jets and communication systems. But sources say that Profumo won't want to sell assets nor embark on an acquisition drive like that he oversaw at UniCredit but rather combine lines of business that use similar industrial processes and skills to produce economies of scale. Leonardo expects new orders to total between 12 billion and 12.5 billion euros this year after it reached 19.9 billion euros in 2016, lifted by a major contract with Kuwait.  The group certainly intends to continue on the path of financial stability, to compete with its peers. We need a profitable business, this is a priority,  Soccodato said.

Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor said on Friday it would block Telegram soon unless it handed over information needed to put the app on an official government list of information distributors. Telegram has so far refused to comply because it fears complying would undermine the privacy of its more than 6 million Russian users.   Once on the list, it would have to store information about its users on Russian servers and hand over user information to the authorities on request.  The FSB, the successor agency to the Soviet-era KGB, weighed into the standoff on Monday, releasing a statement which said Telegram provided  terrorists with the opportunity to create secret chat rooms with a high degree of encryption.  It said a suicide bomber who blew himself up on the St Petersburg metro on April 3, killing 15 people, had used Telegram to plan the attack with his accomplices, and that Telegram had become the most widely used app of its kind by terrorists operating inside Russia. The intervention suggests the authorities are serious about blocking Telegram on national security grounds unless its meets their demands.  Pavel Durov, Telegram's founder, said the app had blocked thousands of terrorism-related channels and that if Russia banned it, terrorists would just switch to a competing service.  The appearance of information saying that Telegram was allegedly used to prepare an act of terrorism three months ago raises questions,  Durov wrote on social media on Monday. FILE PHOTO: Men pose with smartphones in front of a screen showing the Telegram logo in this picture illustration November 18, 2015.Dado Ruvic/File Photo It's sad if Russia's intelligence services are exploiting such a tragedy as a pretext to strengthen their influence and control over the population.     Alexander Zharov, head of the communications regulator, told state-backed NTV on Sunday that Telegram had just days to comply and accused Durov of being an anarchist with no interest in respecting the law.  As far as I know, Mr Durov's unwillingness to hand over the keys to the information to the world's intelligence services allows terrorists to kill people with impunity using this channel of communications,  said Zharov. 'Anti-Constitutional?' Durov, 32, has clashed with the authorities before, refusing to comply with various data requests related to the VKontakte social media site which he set up after leaving university. That row ended with him selling up and leaving the country.     The Kremlin said the latest dispute was purely a matter for the communications regulator. If Telegram was banned, Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman and an avid Telegram user, said he and other officials would switch to another service. Durov said the communications regulator's demands violated Russians' constitutional right to keep their correspondence secret and were also technically impossible to comply with.  He said Telegram was doing its best to help fight terrorism and that blocking it would not help because other encrypted services were available.  If you want to defeat terrorism by blocking stuff, you'll have to block the Internet,  wrote Durov.

Oil prices hovered near last week's seven-month lows, hemmed in by a relentless rise in U.S. supply, bloated global inventories and a surge in demand for short sale contracts that signals investors see potential for a price fall. The S&P; energy fell 0.37 percent and was the biggest laggard among the major S&P; sectors. Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were down about 0.6 percent and were among the biggest drags on the three major indexes. The recent drop in oil prices has spurred concerns about low inflation, which stubbornly remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target rate. The central bank raised rates this month for the second time this year and is expected to raise it again. Futures imply only a 50 percent chance of another rate hike by December. Also dampening sentiment was a fall in technology stocks, as investors, worried about stretched valuations, switch to defensive sectors. The S&P; utilities and telecommunications sectors led the gainers. At 11:03 a.m. ET (1503 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.85 points, or 0.01 percent, at 21,396.61, the S&P; 500 was up 1.06 points, or 0.04 percent, at 2,439.36. The Nasdaq Composite was down 18.40 points, or 0.29 percent, at 6,246.85. The financial index rose 0.59 percent after a string of Federal Reserve policymakers appeared to back another rate hike this year despite a patch of recent weak economic data. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said the Fed needs to raise rates gradually or the economy runs the risk of overheating. New York Fed chief William Dudley said recent narrowing of credit spreads, record stock prices and falling bond yields could encourage the Fed to continue tightening U.S. policy.  We're seeing a very fast rotation that's been typical of the past month or so and it's not necessarily based on what's happening on the yield curve,  said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  It's based more on the economic conversations that we've been seeing from a parade of Fed speakers who continue to tell that same story that we'll see another rate hike this year.  The spread between the U.S. two-year and 10-year bond yield curve flattened to its lowest since September. Data on Monday showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May, with non-defense orders excluding aircraft - a closely watched proxy for business spending plans - dropping 0.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 0.3 percent. Micron was up 1.7 percent at $32.28 after Cowen & Co increased its price target on the chipmaker's stock. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,681 to 1,113. On the Nasdaq, 1,415 issues fell and 1,302 advanced.

The South Korean company said on Monday that the technology, developed in partnership with Toshiba Materials, would produce light more similar to the Sun's rays, capturing customers put off by the current quality of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. LED makers, having cut costs to the bone, are now racing to improve the quality of the energy-efficient lighting as many consumers and organizations still favor the warmer quality of incandescent lightbulbs in regions where they are not banned. Seoul Semi's chief executive and founder told Reuters he foresaw sales of the new  Sun-like  LEDs at around $400 million by 2021, contributing to a target of $3 billion in total sales for the company by then, up from $840 million last year.

The company, which spends heavily on research and development to differentiate itself from rivals in an increasingly commoditized industry, aims to become the world's top LED maker by 2021, up from fifth place in 2015. The global market for packaged LED sales totaled more than $16 billion last year, according to IHS Markit's LED intelligence unit.

The agreement between the Minnesota city and Valerie Castile, the victim's mother, comes a week after the officer who shot Castile, 32, five times was found not guilty of any crime - the bloody aftermath that was seen by millions of people after Castile's girlfriend livestreamed it online. Castile's death drew national attention, coming amid a wave of high-profile police killings of black men, which sparked street protests in cities across the United States. A jury of seven men and five women, 10 of whom were white and two black, last week acquitted St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez for his role in the killing. Yanez testified that he had feared for his life after Castile told him that he was carrying a firearm and reached for his wallet when Yanez asked to see identification. Diamond Reynolds, the girlfriend in the passenger seat who broadcast the aftermath of the shooting on Facebook Live, testified that Castile never reached for the handgun he was licensed to carry. Shortly after the verdict, the City of St. Anthony said Yanez, the son of a Mexican immigrant, would not return to active duty and it was negotiating a  voluntary separation agreement  with him.  I'm mad as hell right now,  Valerie Castile told reporters after the verdict.  My first-born son died. ... Just because he was a police officer, that makes it OK.  She said the verdict shows  the system continues to fail black people.  The family's attorney had said at the time it planned to file a civil lawsuit in federal court. Video footage of the fatal shooting from the dashboard camera of a police car showed how quickly the incident unfolded, but shed no light on whether Castile had reached for his gun. Prosecutors had argued Yanez was not justified in firing his gun, saying Castile was courteous and non-threatening. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the state capitol in St. Paul after the verdict, and a series of speakers demanded justice for minorities in the American judicial system and stronger accountability measures for police.

The justices will hear Digital Realty Trust Inc's appeal of a lower court ruling in favor of Paul Somers, an executive fired by the San Francisco-based company after he complained internally about alleged misconduct by his supervisor but never reported the matter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The case hinges on the SEC's whistleblower protection rules required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. The court agreed to take up the case on the last day of a nine-month session.

The company founded by Johnny Chou, a former Greater China president of Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, said in a securities filing on Monday that it planned to raise the money by listing on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. It did not disclose the number of shares it plans to sell or give an indicative price range for the offering. (bit.ly/2sI6hWO) It follows a number of other Chinese logistics companies that have gone public recently. They include rivals S.F. Holding (002352.SZ), YTO Express (600233.SS) and STO Express (002468.SZ) which listed in Chinese markets, and ZTO Express (ZTO.N), which raised $1.4 billion with a listing in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in October. Best Inc has yet to make a profit, and reported a net loss of 422.8 million yuan ($61.8 million) for the three months ended March 31, but its revenue more than doubled during the quarter to 3.25 billion yuan, led by an increase in its freight and express delivery business. China is the world's biggest logistics market, with nearly $1.6 trillion in spending in 2015, and express delivery is forecast to jump 22.8 percent a year over 2016-2021 in terms of parcel volume, Best Inc said in the filing, citing forecasts from consulting firm iResearch. The market for shipments with smaller trucks is expected to expand by 13.8 percent a year, and China's overall logistics market is forecast to grow by an average 2.1 percent a year from 2016-2021, according to iResearch. In 2016, Hangzhou-based Best Inc derived about 60 percent of its 8.8 billion yuan in revenue from express delivery services, with another 18 percent from freight services with smaller trucks and 14 percent from supply chain management to corporate clients. Alibaba is Best Inc's biggest shareholder with a 23.4 percent stake, followed by founder Chou with 14.7 percent. Private equity firm China Renaissance Capital Investment holds 11.3 percent of the company, while venture capital firm IDG-Accel China Capital has another 6.2 percent. The company raised $750 million in September from a group of investors including CITIC Private Equity, Alibaba affiliate Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Ltd, China Development Bank International and Goldman Sachs. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are the underwriters for the IPO. The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different. Thomson Reuters publication IFR previously reported that Best Inc's IPO could reach $1 billion.

Founded in 1915, Naspers has transformed itself from an apartheid-era newspaper publisher into an $85 billion multinational with private equity-style investments in e-commerce platforms such as auction sites, online retail and e-classifieds. But it owes much of that valuation to its 33 percent Tencent (0700.HK) stake, which is worth about $114 billion, or 20 percent more than Naspers itself. The discount has prompted some investors to urge Chief Executive Bob van Dijk to find ways to narrow it.  From the moment Tencent was listed on Hong Kong stock exchange, some had been asking us to do that. You can imagine how unhappy shareholders would be if I had done that 10 years ago,  van Dijk told Reuters in a telephone interview. The value of Naspers' stake surged from around $231 million to around $114 billion in 2004 when Tencent floated on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Tencent, which runs China's biggest gaming and social media firm, shot past forecasts to post its highest quarterly profit in over two years last month, helped by strong growth in gaming and payments. Tencent is among the firms best placed to benefit from the roll out of faster 4G mobile network in China because it uses its instant messaging platform WeChat - a social media fabric in China - to sell other services such a music and video streaming.     Van Dijk said the discount would narrow as and when the company's e-commerce businesses, whose losses have been rising every year since 2012, contribute to the bottom line.    We're working very hard to build our e-commerce businesses and I'm confident that the discount will narrow over time as those businesses get closer and closer to profitability,  he said, without giving further details.  Naspers has splurged around $4 billion since 2012 to drive growth mainly in commerce platforms that include mobile classifieds apps Letgo and OLX - the biggest classified sites in India and Brazil - but it has little to show for its investments so far.  It once again rode the breakneck rise of Tencent to lift its annual earnings by more than 40 percent on Friday while the e-commerce unit widened losses to $682 million.  Some investors insist pinning hopes on the e-commerce business is not the best solution to close the discount and that van Dijk should still consider hiving off the Tencent holding.  The most effective measure is to spin-off the Tencent stake to Naspers' shareholders,  AIM&R; Managing Director Albert Saporta said in open letter dated June 15 and addressed to van Dijk.   You will not be the CEO of South Africa's largest company by market capitalization anymore, but you will greatly enhance shareholder value.

In research using mice of both sexes, scientists at Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute found that gender differences could impact results in more than half of their experiments. Since these early-stage laboratory studies underpin research into treatments for human diseases, the scientists said sex differences should be an important factor in designing future studies.  A person's sex has a significant impact on the course and severity of many common diseases, and the consequential side-effects of treatments – which are being missed,  Natasha Karp, who co-led the study, wrote in the journal Nature Communications.  With an historic bias towards the scientific study of males, the common approach in biomedical research has been to ignore sex or to analyze only one sex and assume the results applied to the other.   This was a scientific blindspot that we really thought needed exploration,  Karp said. U.S. regulations requiring that both sexes be included in human clinical trials were introduced 20 years ago. Yet in 2006, only 41 percent of people in U.S. trials were women, up from 9 percent in 1970, the researchers said.      Yet sex influences many common conditions, including heart diseases, autoimmune diseases and asthma.  For animal studies, an international review in 2011 and 2012 found that 22 percent did not state the sex of the animals. Of those that did, 80 percent used only males and 3 percent both sexes. In this latest study, Karp's team quantified the difference between male and female mice by analyzing around 230 physical characteristics of more than 50,000 mice.  They found that in the control group, their sex had an impact on 56.6 percent of quantitative traits, such as bone mass, metabolism and blood components, and on 9.9 percent of qualitative traits, such as whether their head shape, coat and paws were normal or abnormal. In mutant mice that had a gene switched off for experimental purposes, gender modified the effect of the mutation in 13.3 percent of qualitative traits and up to 17.7 percent of quantitative ones. Judith Mank of University College London, who worked with Karp, said the findings showed that  only studying males paints half the picture.

The company founded by Johnny Chou, a former Greater China president of Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, said in a securities filing on Monday that it planned to raise the money by listing on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. It did not disclose the number of shares it plans to sell or give an indicative price range for the offering. (bit.ly/2sI6hWO) It follows a number of other Chinese logistics companies that have gone public recently. They include rivals S.F. Holding (002352.SZ), YTO Express (600233.SS) and STO Express (002468.SZ) which listed in Chinese markets, and ZTO Express (ZTO.N), which raised $1.4 billion with a listing in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in October. Best Inc has yet to make a profit, and reported a net loss of 422.8 million yuan ($61.8 million) for the three months ended March 31, but its revenue more than doubled during the quarter to 3.25 billion yuan, led by an increase in its freight and express delivery business. China is the world's biggest logistics market, with nearly $1.6 trillion in spending in 2015, and express delivery is forecast to jump 22.8 percent a year over 2016-2021 in terms of parcel volume, Best Inc said in the filing, citing forecasts from consulting firm iResearch. The market for shipments with smaller trucks is expected to expand by 13.8 percent a year, and China's overall logistics market is forecast to grow by an average 2.1 percent a year from 2016-2021, according to iResearch. In 2016, Hangzhou-based Best Inc derived about 60 percent of its 8.8 billion yuan in revenue from express delivery services, with another 18 percent from freight services with smaller trucks and 14 percent from supply chain management to corporate clients. Alibaba is Best Inc's biggest shareholder with a 23.4 percent stake, followed by founder Chou with 14.7 percent. Private equity firm China Renaissance Capital Investment holds 11.3 percent of the company, while venture capital firm IDG-Accel China Capital has another 6.2 percent. The company raised $750 million in September from a group of investors including CITIC Private Equity, Alibaba affiliate Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Ltd, China Development Bank International and Goldman Sachs. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are the underwriters for the IPO. The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different. Thomson Reuters publication IFR previously reported that Best Inc's IPO could reach $1 billion.

The annual rate of sea level rise increased to 3.3 millimeters (0.13 inch) in 2014 - a rate of 33 centimeters (13 inches) if kept unchanged for a century - from 2.2 mm in 1993, according to a team of scientists in China, Australia and the United States. Sea levels have risen by about 20 cms in the past century and many scientific studies project a steady acceleration this century as man-made global warming melts more ice on land. Until now, however, scientists have found it hard to detect whether the rate has picked up, is flat or has fallen since 1990. The study found that early satellite data had exaggerated the rate of sea level rise in the 1990s, masking the recent acceleration. The confirmation of a quickening rise  highlights the importance and urgency  of working out ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to protect low-lying coasts, the scientists wrote in the journal Nature Climate Change. A thaw of Greenland's ice sheet accounted for more than 25 percent of the sea level rise in 2014 against just 5 percent in 1993, according to the study led by Xianyao Chen of the Ocean University of China and Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology. Other big sources include loss of glaciers from the Himalayas to the Andes, Antarctica's ice sheet and a natural expansion of ocean water as it warms up from its most dense at 4 degrees Celsius (39.2°F). A U.N. panel of climate scientists said in 2014 that sea levels could rise by up to about a meter by 2100.  Several climate experts who were not involved in the study welcomed the findings.  This is a major warning to us about the dangers of a sea level rise that will continue for many centuries even after global warming is stopped,  Peter Wadhams, of the University of Cambridge, said in a statement.  A big question in climate science has been whether the rise in global sea level rise is accelerating. Now there is strong evidence that this is indeed the case,  said Brian Hoskins of Imperial College, London. A rise in sea levels will threaten low-lying coasts from Miami to Bangladesh, cities from Shanghai to San Francisco and small island states such as Tuvalu in the Pacific.

Founded in 1915, Naspers has transformed itself from an apartheid-era newspaper publisher into an $85 billion multinational with private equity-style investments in e-commerce platforms such as auction sites, online retail and e-classifieds. But it owes much of that valuation to its 33 percent Tencent (0700.HK) stake, which is worth about $114 billion, or 20 percent more than Naspers itself. The discount has prompted some investors to urge Chief Executive Bob van Dijk to find ways to narrow it.  From the moment Tencent was listed on Hong Kong stock exchange, some had been asking us to do that. You can imagine how unhappy shareholders would be if I had done that 10 years ago,  van Dijk told Reuters in a telephone interview. The value of Naspers' stake surged from around $231 million to around $114 billion in 2004 when Tencent floated on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Tencent, which runs China's biggest gaming and social media firm, shot past forecasts to post its highest quarterly profit in over two years last month, helped by strong growth in gaming and payments. Tencent is among the firms best placed to benefit from the roll out of faster 4G mobile network in China because it uses its instant messaging platform WeChat - a social media fabric in China - to sell other services such a music and video streaming.     Van Dijk said the discount would narrow as and when the company's e-commerce businesses, whose losses have been rising every year since 2012, contribute to the bottom line.    We're working very hard to build our e-commerce businesses and I'm confident that the discount will narrow over time as those businesses get closer and closer to profitability,  he said, without giving further details.  Naspers has splurged around $4 billion since 2012 to drive growth mainly in commerce platforms that include mobile classifieds apps Letgo and OLX - the biggest classified sites in India and Brazil - but it has little to show for its investments so far.  It once again rode the breakneck rise of Tencent to lift its annual earnings by more than 40 percent on Friday while the e-commerce unit widened losses to $682 million.  Some investors insist pinning hopes on the e-commerce business is not the best solution to close the discount and that van Dijk should still consider hiving off the Tencent holding.  The most effective measure is to spin-off the Tencent stake to Naspers' shareholders,  AIM&R; Managing Director Albert Saporta said in open letter dated June 15 and addressed to van Dijk.   You will not be the CEO of South Africa's largest company by market capitalization anymore, but you will greatly enhance shareholder value.

The justices will hear Digital Realty Trust Inc's appeal of a lower court ruling in favor of Paul Somers, an executive fired by the San Francisco-based company after he complained internally about alleged misconduct by his supervisor but never reported the matter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The case hinges on the SEC's whistleblower protection rules required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. The court agreed to take up the case on the last day of a nine-month session. The court will hear the case during the next term that starts in October. The SEC rules, adopted in 2011, prohibit corporate employers from retaliating in any way against whistleblowers who try to report allegations of securities law violations.  They also give the SEC the power to offer monetary awards to whistleblowers whose tips lead to successful enforcement actions. Digital Realty Trust argues the anti-retaliation protections do not apply to people who fail to report their allegations to the SEC because the law defines a whistleblower as a person who reports possible securities violations to the SEC.  If the Supreme Court ultimately sides with the company, then it would force corporate whistleblowers to report wrongdoing to the SEC in order to be protected from retaliation. Such a result could deter people from reporting misconduct internally first, said Jordan Thomas, a partner at Labaton Sucharow who represents SEC whistleblowers.   I think both corporate whistleblowers and corporations should hope that the Supreme Court finds that internal reporting is sufficient to have the anti-retaliation protections because if not, sophisticated corporate whistleblowers will bypass internal reporting systems and report directly to the SEC,  he said. Digital Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust company, became entangled in the dispute over whistleblower protection after it fired Somers, its former vice president of portfolio management. Somers had complained internally that his supervisor had eliminated some internal controls and hid major cost overruns on a project in Hong Kong. After he was fired, he sued the company in November 2014, saying he was protected from retaliation as a whistleblower under the Dodd-Frank law.  The company tried unsuccessfully to quash his claim in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. While the case was on appeal before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a divided 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled in a similar case that people who only report misconduct internally are whistleblowers who merit protection from retaliation.  The 9th Circuit later affirmed the California finding, with the SEC also filing a friend of the court brief in the case and participating in oral arguments in support of Somers.  Both the 2nd and 9th Circuit opinions are at odds with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which previously held that whistleblowers must report to the SEC in order to receive protective status.

The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.2 percent in May, the largest decline since December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast these so-called core capital goods orders rising 0.3 percent last month. The report added to growing worries that an acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter may not be as robust as expected. Recent data on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation have given pause and housing data has been mixed. Those worries have stoked doubts that the Fed will be able to follow through on its plan to boost interest rates one more time this year and three times next year. The durable goods data  is certainly is a small reminder of other pieces of more important data that haven’t been particularly strong,  said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.  The dollar has lost a bit of its appeal because of the fact that many market participants think that the Fed is less likely to raise rates.  The euro rose against the dollar to $1.1219, its highest since June 15, and was last up 0.2 percent at $1.1214. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was only down 0.1 percent at 97.165 as anticipation of comments from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Monday and a speech from Fed chair Janet Janet Yellen on Tuesday mitigated the dollar's losses.  We’ll know more from Yellen tomorrow,  said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd in New York.  Traders are still split on what the Fed is going to do.  While the dollar was slightly higher against the yen at 111.38 yen, it dipped against emerging market currencies such as the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. Scalone of TJM Brokerage said traders were buying emerging market currencies for their higher yields given low trading volatility.  We are unfortunately in the midst of the summer doldrums,  he said.

A carefully packaged week of announcements created momentum that Boeing has struggled to display in recent years after being outmanoeuvred for sales of single-aisle planes since the pair decided to upgrade their best-selling models early this decade. Boeing has seen its market share fall from 50 percent to around 42 percent for the latest models, partly because the Airbus A320 family's design allowed it to use a larger version of the latest generation of engines, which helps in some cases. It was the first show in their respective roles for ex-General Electric executive Kevin McAllister, the first outsider hired to run Boeing's commercial division, and Ihssane Mounir, recently made sales chief after fighting Airbus in North Asia. Its outcome reflects a  more aggressive marketing strategy  at the U.S. company, Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel wrote in a note. Boeing got 361 orders and commitments for the 737 MAX 10 from 16 customers, including 147 incremental ones. Reuters had reported it would win close to 150 incremental orders.  It's a fightback. It goes back to (McAllister's predecessor) Ray Conner's recent talk about winning markets,  said Nick Cunningham, analyst at UK-based Agency Partners.  The battle showed itself in price and is now beginning to show itself in products.  Boeing's energy contrasted with a flatter tone than usual from Airbus, even though it too won more orders than expected. It suggests Boeing will be looking to maintain last week's momentum as it tries to poach Airbus customers without the previous disadvantage of an uneven portfolio dependent mainly on the smaller MAX 8, industry sources said. That could result in bruising battles as Boeing's fired-up new management targets Airbus customers while working on a separate new mid-sized aircraft project for next decade. Airbus denied it had lost any momentum. Its executives painted the 737 MAX 10 as something forced on Boeing to defend a weak market share, and highlighted the more than 200 conversions to 737 MAX 10s from existing Boeing orders. Some questioned whether all buyers would stick with the model.  It was a good PR exercise. I am not so sure if there was as much quality or substance to they deals they did at the air show,  said Kiran Rao, recently designated as successor to Airbus sales chief John Leahy, who retires this year. Analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham News played down Airbus's objection about conversions, saying switching up in size is standard and noting the important backing of United Airlines for the new Boeing model. Still, industry sources said Boeing's decision to launch the 737 MAX 10, seating up to 230 people, was a twin defensive move. Most attention focused on Boeing's need to fix a gap in seats at the top end of its single-aisle portfolio against the A321neo, which Airbus says can seat up to 240 people. Protecting 737 Max 8 But Boeing had a second reason to launch the 737 MAX 10. Industry sources say it had grown increasingly worried about losing sales of its main cash cow, the MAX 8, through the back door because of interlocking relationships between models. Alarm bells began ringing at the same air show two years ago when Korean Air split a $6.9 billion order for narrow-body jets between the A321neo and Boeing 737 MAX 8. The success of the A321neo created the threat that Boeing customers who needed a high proportion of the larger category in their fleets could pick the A321neo, and then take the 150-seat A320neo by default to avoid the inefficiency of two types. Airbus says the A321neo size will make up half the single- aisle market, worth $3 trillion over 20 years. Boeing says it will be closer to 25 percent. But even at Boeing's lower estimate, the success of the A321neo handed Airbus a powerful lever to make inroads into the rest of Boeing's fleet and damage its biggest-selling product.  It was a threat. Boeing needed to defend the 737 MAX 8,  a senior aircraft leasing company executive said. The grab for market share, which began under soon-to-retire Boeing vice chairman Ray Conner, who handed the commercial unit to McAllister in November, still leaves Boeing trailing Airbus.  It improves the 737's competitive position but does not resolve it entirely,  Cunningham said. Mounir rejected a suggestion that Boeing had approached the air show in the spirit of 'attack is the best form of defence'.  We are playing offence; this was offence,  he told Reuters.

In research using mice of both sexes, scientists at Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute found that gender differences could impact results in more than half of their experiments. Since these early-stage laboratory studies underpin research into treatments for human diseases, the scientists said sex differences should be an important factor in designing future studies.  A person's sex has a significant impact on the course and severity of many common diseases, and the consequential side-effects of treatments – which are being missed,  Natasha Karp, who co-led the study, wrote in the journal Nature Communications.  With an historic bias towards the scientific study of males, the common approach in biomedical research has been to ignore sex or to analyze only one sex and assume the results applied to the other.   This was a scientific blindspot that we really thought needed exploration,  Karp said. U.S. regulations requiring that both sexes be included in human clinical trials were introduced 20 years ago. Yet in 2006, only 41 percent of people in U.S. trials were women, up from 9 percent in 1970, the researchers said.      Yet sex influences many common conditions, including heart diseases, autoimmune diseases and asthma.

In research using mice of both sexes, scientists at Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute found that gender differences could impact results in more than half of their experiments. Since these early-stage laboratory studies underpin research into treatments for human diseases, the scientists said sex differences should be an important factor in designing future studies.  A person's sex has a significant impact on the course and severity of many common diseases, and the consequential side-effects of treatments – which are being missed,  Natasha Karp, who co-led the study, wrote in the journal Nature Communications.  With an historic bias towards the scientific study of males, the common approach in biomedical research has been to ignore sex or to analyze only one sex and assume the results applied to the other.   This was a scientific blindspot that we really thought needed exploration,  Karp said. U.S. regulations requiring that both sexes be included in human clinical trials were introduced 20 years ago. Yet in 2006, only 41 percent of people in U.S. trials were women, up from 9 percent in 1970, the researchers said.      Yet sex influences many common conditions, including heart diseases, autoimmune diseases and asthma.  For animal studies, an international review in 2011 and 2012 found that 22 percent did not state the sex of the animals. Of those that did, 80 percent used only males and 3 percent both sexes.

Double Olympic triple jump champion Christian Taylor and fellow Rio gold medalists Ryan Crouser, Dalilah Muhammad and Tianna Bartoletta, plus hurdles world record holder Keni Harrison and Aries Merritt, all qualified at the cutthroat U.S. championships that concluded on Sunday.  It looks entirely possible that Team USA could match its impressive Rio (Olympic) tally in August,  international athletics expert Mel Watman told Reuters. The Americans won 13 gold medals in Rio after underperforming at the last world championships in Beijing two years ago with just six. One-two punches in the triple jump, men's and women's shot put, women's long jump and women's 400 meters hurdles plus strong showings in the relays could all produce gold for the U.S. in London, Watman said. But the Americans, who love their sprints, will likely face major roadblocks in the men's events even though they have the year's fastest at 100 meters (Christian Coleman, 9.82 seconds) and 400 (Fred Kerley, 43.70). World record holders Usain Bolt, who is retiring after the London 100, and Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa in the 400 will be the fans' favorites. Olympic silver medalist Justin Gatlin, winner of the U.S. 100 over Coleman, also should be a contender in the London race as he faces Bolt for the last time. Rio medalist Tori Bowie highlights the U.S. women's sprints, but must again face Jamaican double Olympic champion Elaine Thompson in the 100. The U.S. should gain medals in many of the same events where they made the podium in Rio, with 22 of the 29 individual medalists qualifying for London.

Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsDefending triple jump champion Taylor and Olympic silver medalist Will Claye again rank 1 and 2 in the world with Crouser and Olympic runner-up Joe Kovacs sharing similar honors in the men's shot put. Taylor is approaching Jonathan Edwards' triple jump world record, and Crouser delivered the longest shot put in 14 years at 22.65 meters on Sunday. Bartoletta and Olympic silver medalist Brittney Reese, who has the top jump in the world this season, will be tough to defeat in the women's long jump with Raven Saunders and Danie Bunch the best two women's shot putters of 2017. They will be joined by Olympic gold medalist Michelle Carter. Jun 25, 2017; Sacramento, CA, USA; Ryan Crouser wins the shot put with a throw of 74-3 3/4 (22.65m) - the longest in the world in 14 years - during the USA Track and Field Championships at Hornet Stadium. Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsNo event was more impressive in Sacramento than the women's 400 meters hurdles, though, with Olympic gold medalist Muhammad leading three women under 53 seconds for the first time ever in the same race. All three could claim medals in London.  Watman, the co-editor of Athletics International, also was impressed by Olympic bronze medalist Sam Kendricks, who provided the first six meters pole vault of the outdoor season and the U.S. 4x400 meters relay's chances.  In Sacramento four men ran 44.50 or quicker in the 400m final didn't include vastly experienced LaShawn Merritt who has a wild card,  he said. Rio Olympic pole vault silver medalist Sandi Morris also could be in the mix for medals, Watman said  World 400 meters champion Allyson Felix also is moving into contention after working on her speed in the 100 and 200 at Sacramento.

A Reuters survey of five major hotels found average occupancy was around 57 percent at the start of the Eid festival on Sunday which marks the end of the Ramadan fasting month when friends and families eat and pray together and take holidays. “We’re usually packed with Saudis and Bahrainis but not this year,” a staff member at a five-star hotel said. Aviation analyst Will Horton estimated Hamad International Airport, one of the Middle East's busiest, would handle 76 percent as many flights in early July compared with the same period last year, a loss of about 27,000 passengers a day. The airport did not respond to a Reuters request for data on the impact of sanctions. Visitors from the rest of the Gulf Cooperation Council usually account for almost half of all visitors to Qatar. So a decision by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt to cut diplomatic and transport ties on June 5 hit traffic hard. “Doha in early July, assuming the restrictions remain, will have less capacity than a year ago - a confronting figure for a region where every month sets year-on-year records,” said Horton, senior analyst at Australia's CAPA Centre for Aviation. There is no breakthrough in sight for the crisis in which the four Arab nations issued an ultimatum to Doha to close Al Jazeera television, curb ties with Iran, shut a Turkish base and pay reparations. A defiant Doha has denied accusations of supporting terrorism and says the demands are unrealistic. Air Travel Hit Hundreds of weekly flights to and from Qatar have already been cancelled because of the dispute. Hamad airport will lose fees paid by airlines and passengers, as well as terminal revenue from duty free shops and restaurants. Air links suspended by the four Arab states represented around 25 percent of flights by state-owned Qatar Airways, one of the region's big three carriers. Elsewhere in the tourist sector, hotels, restaurants and other facilities have had to find new sources of services and goods, in some cases, at higher cost, due to the boycott, said Rashid Aboobacker, senior director at TRI Consulting in Dubai. “A substantial drop in visitor arrivals is likely to force hotel and real estate developers to re-evaluate their strategies and priorities, potentially causing delays to some of the ongoing (tourism) projects,” he said. Qatar’s World Cup organising committee said sanctions had not affected preparations for the tournament and alternative sources for construction materials had been secured. Qatar has said 46,000 rooms will be available to host fans by the time of the World Cup. In March, it had 119 hotels with 23,347 rooms, according to the tourism authority. Developing business and leisure tourism is part of Qatar's drive to develop its economy away from reliance on oil and gas revenue. Doha aims to raise the tourism sector's contribution to GDP to 5.2 percent by 2030 from around 4.1 percent now, while raising the number of people employed by nearly 70 percent to 127,900.

May struck a deal to prop up her government by agreeing to at least 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in extra funding for the British province in return for the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). It means the eurosceptic DUP will back Britain's departure from the European Union amid concerns that Northern Ireland will be the region most vulnerable economically to Brexit because of its close trade links to the Republic of Ireland. The 500 km (312 miles) long border between the two is the UK's only land border with the EU. The DUP was among the most enthusiastic cheerleaders for Brexit and wants Britain to leave the EU's single market and customs union, but its manifesto for the British election focused heavily on maintaining the benefits of membership, including an open border with the Republic. Dublin too wants to avoid the return of a physical barrier in place of the currently invisible frontier, fearing it could put at risk a 1998 peace deal that led to the removal of military checkpoints along the border.  I note that the agreement provides for DUP support for British government legislation on Brexit,  Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said in a statement ahead of talks to try to restore Northern Ireland's power-sharing regional government.  An enhanced Northern Ireland voice articulating an agreed devolved government position could see more effective and inclusive representation of the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland at Westminster.  May's pledge to provide the funding through the province's power-sharing executive put pressure on the pro-British DUP and Irish nationalist rivals Sinn Fein to revive their compulsory coalition before a fresh deadline to do so elapses on Thursday. Many analysts believe a deal that hands Northern Ireland additional funding but does not damage Irish nationalist interests or undermine peace could motivate Sinn Fein to agree to return to government. The agreement struck by May stated that the DUP will have no involvement in the British government's role in political talks in Northern Ireland and that both parties would adhere fully to the peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence.  I welcome both parties recommitment to the Good Friday Agreement and its successors, and the commitment by the British Government to govern in the interests of all parts of the community in Northern Ireland,  Coveney said.

Spokesmen from the Japan Coast Guard (JCG), U.S. Coast Guard and ship owner, Dainichi Invest, also declined to comment. Reuters was not able to contact Advincula, who was no longer in Japan.  The investigations will examine witness testimony and electronic data to determine how a naval destroyer fitted with sophisticated radar could be struck by a vessel more than three times its size.  Another focus of the probes has been the length of time it took the ACX Crystal to report the collision. The JCG says it was first notified at 2:25 a.m., nearly an hour after the accident.  In his report, the ACX Crystal's captain said there was  confusion  on his ship's bridge, and that it turned around and returned to the collision site after continuing for 6 nautical miles (11 km).

Italy started winding down two failed regional banks on Sunday in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros ($19 billion) and will leave the lenders' good assets in the hands of the nation's biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo.  If banks are unprofitable, it is better to let them exit the market than keep them artificially alive with precautionary recapitalisation,  Finance Ministry spokeswoman Friederike von Tiesenhausen said, stressing that she could not comment on individual cases.  The use of state aid should be avoided as much as possible in bankruptcy cases,  she said, adding:  In insolvency proceedings too, the use of state aid should be avoided as much as possible. It is the task of the European Commission to ensure that state aid is limited to a minimum and to prevent the circumvention of winding down rules through national insolvency programmes.  Italy will pay 5.2 billion euros to Intesa, and give it guarantees of up 12 billion euros, so that it will take over the remains of Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, which collapsed after years of mismanagement and poor lending. The deal allows Italy to solve a banking crisis on its own terms, ensuring the two Veneto lenders are not wound down under potentially tougher European rules. The cost for taxpayers, however, is hefty. Germany wants people who put their savings into bank bonds to suffer losses as a condition for state support.

Farmers said the weather was hurting the April-September mid-crop and cocoa pods were rotting on trees. They also reported a tightness of supply.

Further trafficking is expected to inflate Ghanaian output from its 11-week light cocoa crop, which opened on June 9. The surge in smuggling has been driven by top producer Ivory Coast's decision to slash its guaranteed farmer price by 36 percent to 700 CFA francs ($1.19) per kilogram at the start of its April-to-September mid-crop due to a wave of export contract defaults and falling world prices. Ghana, the world's number two cocoa grower, maintained its farmgate price at $1,914 per tonne, creating a price gap of more than $700 per tonne that the exporters said has fuelled a wave of cross-border smuggling. Estimates of the volumes already smuggled since the start of April given by three exporters ranged from 70,000 to 80,000 tonnes with total trafficking of Ivorian beans into Ghana predicted to reach between 120,000 to 140,000 tonnes.  I think we are easily at 70,000 tonnes from early April up to last week,  said one Abidjan-based exporter.  We're expecting to hit some 120,000 tonnes by the end of the season, because the peak here will be in July or August and a big part of those beans will end up in Ghana.  Production from Ghana's main crop, which closed on May 18, hit a six-year high of 882,175 tonnes, regulator Cocobod's chief executive Joseph Boahen Aidoo told Reuters last week. Cocobod has forecast purchases from the light crop at 70,000 tonnes of beans. However, one Cocobod official told Reuters last week that they could hit 100,000 tonnes, mainly due to good weather conditions. The official said Cocobod was aware of possible smuggling from Ivory Coast and had put in place tighter border and quality controls. Cocoa smuggling between Ghana and Ivory Coast is quite common, with its direction shifting back and forth depending on the price difference between the two countries. Farmers and crop experts in Ghana's eastern cocoa belt said they expected overall production for the season to rise by a third due to good rains. It could also benefit from government efforts to clamp down on illegal gold mining.  It's been raining and our cherelles (young pods) are coming out well but the illegal miners are destroying the farms with excavators,  Mark Dari, who farms 15 hectares in the eastern region town of Kibi, told Reuters.

Credit Suisse and Russian lender VTB have come under scrutiny after negotiating loans totalling some $2 billion with three firms owned by Mozambique - one of the poorest countries in the world. Discovery of the loans - unapproved by parliament - to tuna fishing company EMATUM, security firm Proindicus and Mozambique Asset Management (MAM) led the International Monetary Fund and Western donors to halt support to Mozambique, triggering the collapse of its currency and leading to a default on debt. An external forensic audit of the debt - demanded by the IMF and conducted by Kroll - was released on Saturday by the Mozambique prosecutor general. The audit said Credit Suisse, as the lead arranger of loans to Proindicus and EMATUM, received $10.1 million and $13.7 million respectively in bank fees.  Banking fees for Credit Suisse totalled $23 million – roughly 2.3 percent of the total financings and is in line with comparable emerging market financing transactions,  Credit Suisse said in a statement emailed on Sunday. Previous reports that the bank had realised $100 million or more in  arranging  fees had been  incorrect and misleading , it added. However, the audit found that $141 million in so-called  contractor fees  were charged across the two arrangements by Credit Suisse. The auditor said Credit Suisse had explained it had effectively passed those fees on to syndicated loan members or - in the case of EMATUM - bond investors. VTB received a $35 million fee for being the lead arranger for a $535 million loan to MAM, Kroll said. This brought total fees paid on the $2 billion loan to 199.7 million - or some 10 percent - the auditor added. VTB has not commented. The audit also concluded that not enough had been done to explain how $2 billion in loans was spent and roughly a quarter of the money remained unaccounted for. Kroll accused officials in the southern African country of giving inconsistent answers about how $500 million earmarked for the tuna fishing company had been spent. The report flagged concerns over the discrepancies in the prices for assets and services that had been provided, adding the process for providing government guarantees for a combined value of $1 billion appeared to be  inadequate .

New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter.      The reports added to a recent batch of mixed economic figures that have left investors skeptical about the Fed's stated plan of raising U.S. rates once more before the end of 2017 and another three times next year. A slower pace of hikes could support demand for high-yielding emerging market assets.     Traders will look for further clues on the U.S. central bank's outlook on Tuesday, when Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to deliver a widely anticipated speech in Europe.     The Brazilian real strengthened 0.9 percent, while the Mexican peso touched its strongest level since May 2016. Colombian markets were closed for a local holiday.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 1.3 percent, the biggest gainer among markets in the region. Shares of steelmakers, such as Cia Siderúrgica Nacional SA and Usinas Siderúrgicas de Minas Gerais SA, led the upswing, tracking rising prices of steel and iron ore.     Alpargatas SA, which is not part of the benchmark index, rose 4.3 percent to a nearly two-month high after its controlling shareholder J&F; Investimentos SA signed a nondisclosure agreement with Cambuhy Investimentos Ltda to potentially sell all of its shares.     Alpargatas is among the J&F; assets put up for sale as the holding company seeks funds to pay for a 10.3 billion real  ($3.11 billion) fine with Brazilian prosecutors.

The three reporters were arrested in Myanmar's northeastern Shan state, the army said in a statement, along with four other men returning from the territory controlled by the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), an ethnic militia in a stand-off with government troops. The army identified the reporters by name and organisation but it did not identify the other four men. The three reporters are from two media organisations publishing both in Burmese and English, the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) and the Irrawaddy. The media were among few organisations providing the world with independent coverage of Myanmar when it was a military dictatorship before the transition began in 2011. The arrests are likely to increase fears that despite electing its first civilian government in about half a century in 2015 led by national heroine Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar reporters face increasing restrictions on freedom of speech.  In any country around the world, journalists have to cover news from both sides of the conflict. We are doing our job. We don't think that is a mistake,  Aye Chan Naing, chief editor of the DVB told Reuters by telephone. Irrawaddy editors were not immediately available for comment. Officials in Myanmar and Thailand burned illegal narcotics worth more than $800 million to mark the United Nations day against drug abuse and trafficking. The arrested reporters attended a similar event organised by TNLA on its territory. The army said that the men had communicated with TNLA, which is  currently opposing the country's rule of law using arms . The army detained the men and handed them over to a local police station in the city of Lashio. The investigation is ongoing, it said. The military did not specify what laws were broken, but Myanmar's colonial-era's Unlawful Association Act, which during the junta was used to stifle dissent, stipulates that people associating with illegal groups can face between two and three years in jail - and a fine. Underscoring growing concerns over free speech, earlier this month over 100 reporters protested against laws seen as curbing expression when two senior journalists went on trial after the military sued them over a critical article. Despite pressure from human rights bodies and Western diplomats, Suu Kyi's government has retained broadly worded laws decried by monitors as violating free speech and has not spoken out against increasingly frequent arrests of reporters and activists.  Laws applied capriciously to journalists ... create a hostile atmosphere for the press and serve only to further stifle the freedom of expression,  said Richard Weir, a Yangon-based analysts for watchdog Human Rights Watch.  The recent spate of targeting journalists is a stark reminder that the tools of repression remain in place in Myanmar and the government rarely hesitates to wield them in order to silence its critics and opponents.

May struck a deal to prop up her government by agreeing to at least 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in extra funding for the British province in return for the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). It means the eurosceptic DUP will back Britain's departure from the European Union amid concerns that Northern Ireland will be the region most vulnerable economically to Brexit because of its close trade links to the Republic of Ireland. The 500 km (312 miles) long border between the two is the UK's only land border with the EU. The DUP was among the most enthusiastic cheerleaders for Brexit and wants Britain to leave the EU's single market and customs union, but its manifesto for the British election focused heavily on maintaining the benefits of membership, including an open border with the Republic. Dublin too wants to avoid the return of a physical barrier in place of the currently invisible frontier, fearing it could put at risk a 1998 peace deal that led to the removal of military checkpoints along the border.  I note that the agreement provides for DUP support for British government legislation on Brexit,  Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said in a statement ahead of talks to try to restore Northern Ireland's power-sharing regional government.  An enhanced Northern Ireland voice articulating an agreed devolved government position could see more effective and inclusive representation of the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland at Westminster.  May's pledge to provide the funding through the province's power-sharing executive put pressure on the pro-British DUP and Irish nationalist rivals Sinn Fein to revive their compulsory coalition before a fresh deadline to do so elapses on Thursday. Many analysts believe a deal that hands Northern Ireland additional funding but does not damage Irish nationalist interests or undermine peace could motivate Sinn Fein to agree to return to government. The agreement struck by May stated that the DUP will have no involvement in the British government's role in political talks in Northern Ireland and that both parties would adhere fully to the peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence.  I welcome both parties recommitment to the Good Friday Agreement and its successors, and the commitment by the British Government to govern in the interests of all parts of the community in Northern Ireland,  Coveney said.

The investment was announced four days after Berkshire said it would invest up to C$400 million for a 38.4 percent equity stake in Canadian lender Home Capital Corp and provide a C$2 billion credit line.  An investment in our company from one of history's most admired investors represents a vote of confidence in our experienced leadership team,  Store Chief Executive Christopher Volk said in a statement.  Berkshire Hathaway's investment solidly positions Store for continued growth, while adding measurably to our already strong financial position.  Shares of Store rose more than $2, or 10 percent, to $22.86 in early trading. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Store is a Scottsdale, Arizona-based real estate investment trust whose portfolio includes more than 1,750 properties in 48 U.S. states. Its specialties include sale-leaseback transactions, where owners sell properties and lease them back, freeing up sale proceeds to invest elsewhere. Store plans to use proceeds from the offering to buy properties, repay debt and other purposes.

The omens are not good. The United Nations has called estranged Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides to open-ended talks in the Alpine resort of Crans-Montana on June 28. Their goal is a peace deal uniting Cyprus under a federal umbrella and which could also define the future of Europe's relations with Turkey, a key player in the conflict. Two issues stand out; Turkish Cypriot demands for a rotating presidency, and Greek Cypriot demands that Turkey pull all its troops off the island, and renounce its intervention rights.  Publicly, neither side is willing to budge. Greek Cypriots, in a further complication, have issued an advisory to drill for natural gas in mid-July, plans vehemently opposed by Turkey which says the island nation has no jurisdiction.  My expectations are rather low,  said Hubert Faustmann, Professor of History and Politics at the University of Nicosia.  Divided in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by an abortive coup by seekers of union with Greece, mediators say the two sides have come closer than they ever had to a deal, but the hard chapters have been left until last. Diplomats hope leaders Nicos Anastasiades and Mustafa Akinci can strike a deal with the backing of Greece, Britain and Turkey. Those three countries are guarantor powers of Cyprus under a treaty which granted the former colony independence in 1960.  Greece and the Greek Cypriots want the guarantor system dismantled. The system allows any of the three countries to intervene to restore constitutional order. An abandoned outpost is seen at the UN-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia, Cyprus June 26, 2017.Yiannis KourtoglouTurkey and Turkish Cypriots want the guarantor system, or some vestige of it, to remain in place. But if there is a compromise on that, everything else should fall into place.  It will all depend on the security chapter ... If they agree it will be a success, a breakthrough. If it doesn't it will be a failure,  Faustmann said. On the eve of the summit, both sides have stood their ground. A Turkish Cypriot official engaged in talks told Reuters that sharing a rotating presidency was a 'sine qua non', or non-negotiable, for their side.     A man stands in front of a gate in the UN-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia, Cyprus June 26, 2017.Yiannis KourtoglouChristoforos Fokaides, the Greek Cypriot defense minister, reiterated the position of his side on Sunday.  Any deal, he said, must allow peaceful co-existence on the island   without occupation troops, and the anachronism of guarantees . Turkey has some 30,000 troops in northern Cyprus, a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state. Greeks want them gone. Stars have been on alignment over Cyprus before, only to be blown spectacularly apart.  Any deal must pass separate simultaneous referenda in both communities. A previous endeavor by the UN in 2004 flopped when Greek Cypriots rejected the reunification blueprint.  There have been 50 years of negotiations. We have to make up our minds,  said the Turkish Cypriot official involved in negotiations.  Are we going to tell people we have a good deal? It might not be perfect but if you want to reach perfection you can talk a few more decades.

Homosexuality is a criminal offence in the East African nation, where the law states that suspects convicted of having  carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature  could face up to 30 years in jail. At a rally late on Sunday, Tanzania's Home Affairs Minister Mwigulu Nchemba said both domestic and foreign campaigners for gay rights would now face punitive measures in the country.  Those who want to campaign for gay rights should find another country that allows those things,  Nchemba said in the capital Dodoma.  If we establish that any organisation registered in our country is campaigning for gay rights ... I will deregister that organisation. If a Tanzanian national is doing that campaign, we will arrest him and take him to court ... and if it is a foreigner, we will immediately order him to leave the country.  The planned crackdown comes amid repeated warnings against  immoral behaviours  by President John Magufuli, who is nicknamed  the Bulldozer  for pushing through his policies. Last week, he rejected calls to lift the decades-long ban on pregnant students from attending state schools, drawing criticism from rights groups. Nchemba said Magufuli's decisions were final and non-negotiable. Since his ascent to power in 2015, Magufuli has been praised by some Western donors for his bid to stamp out corruption and cut wasteful government spending. Opponents, however, accuse him of becoming increasingly authoritarian by curbing political activity and cracking down on dissent.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's rationale for the affirmation of Thrivent's ratings reflects the company's exceptionally strong capitalization and Fitch's belief that management is committed to maintaining statutory capital levels in excess of rating guidelines. The rating level also considers Thrivent's very strong business profile. Fitch views Thrivent's capitalization as exceptionally strong and of high quality. Total adjusted capital (TAC) increased 2% in 1Q17 to $9.2 billion, while risk-based capital (RBC) remains among the highest in Fitch's rated universe at 750%. Further, Thrivent has not issued surplus notes to support its capital and does not use captive insurers to fund excess life reserves. The company attained a Prism score of 'Extremely Strong' in 2016. Thrivent's capital strength is also demonstrated by its extremely low operating leverage of 5.6x as of 1Q17. The company's low total financing and commitments ratio of 0.1x at year-end 2016 reflects its lack of financial debt and disciplined use of securities lending. Fitch considers Thrivent's business profile very strong. Fitch believes the faith-based affiliation Thrivent shares with its membership provides the company with a distinct competitive advantage in the form of a higher level of institutional trust and higher policyholder persistency. Thrivent's inforce business is split primarily between annuities and life insurance, with modest exposure to long-term care insurance. Fitch views Thrivent's product portfolio as generally more conservative and lower risk product design compared with the industry. Thrivent's earnings declined in 2016, with the return on total adjusted capital declining to 8%, as results were negatively impacted by a $114 million increase in the long-term care (LTC) insurance premium deficiency reserve. Earnings have benefitted from strong private equity returns in recent years, which are expected to moderate. Additionally, Fitch expects earnings to decline modestly from current levels, driven by increased expenses in support of the company's growth and its strategy to return excess surplus to members. 1Q17 results were in-line with the full year 2016, with a pre-fraternal spend, post-dividend return on assets of 99 bps. Fitch considers Thrivent to have an average exposure to interest rates, as its block of individual participating whole life business partially offsets its spread-based business and legacy long-term care exposure. Fitch notes that while LTC is a relatively small part of the company's product portfolio (11% of general account reserves), it does impose some surplus risk in the current low interest rate environment. With a membership of about 2.3 million, Thrivent is the largest fraternal benefit society in the U.S. The company reported assets under advisement of $117 billion as of year-end 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could trigger a negative rating action: --A decrease in RBC to below 550%, a Prism score below 'Extremely Strong' and/or an increase in operating leverage to above 8x; --Material negative trends in earnings and/or fraternal membership; -- An unexpected shift in tax, regulatory or market dynamics that affects Thrivent's competitive strengths. Fitch does not anticipate an upgrade given the company's modest size and scale versus 'AAA' rated peers. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA'; --IFS at 'AA+'. Thrivent Life Insurance Company --IFS at 'AA+'. Fitch has affirmed the following rating: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'. Contact: Primary Analyst Jamie R.

At an informal debate among EU energy ministers, Germany's partners in the 28-nation bloc spoke out against Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline plan to pump more gas directly from Russia's Baltic coast to Germany. EU nations are expected to vote in the autumn on the European Commission's request for a mandate to negotiate with Russia on behalf of the bloc as a whole. Germany, the main beneficiary of the pipeline, sees it as a purely commercial project, with Chancellor Angela Merkel last week saying she saw no role for the Commission. The plan taps into divisions among the bloc over doing business with Russia, which covers a third of the EU's gas needs, despite sanctions against Moscow over its military intervention in Ukraine. In private, EU officials say they hope direct talks with Russia would delay the project past 2019, depriving Russian state gas exporter Gazprom of leverage in talks over transit fees for Ukraine, the current route for most gas supplies to Europe. Germany, Austria and France - which have firms partnering with Gazprom on the project - declined to take the floor on Monday, EU diplomats said.  We had 13 delegations intervening, with all of them being supportive of the Commission's approach,  Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic told Reuters by telephone after presenting the EU executive's case to member states.  I am definitely optimistic about getting the mandate, but I know this is just the beginning of the debate.  The Commission found support from Italy as well as Nordic, Eastern European and Baltic states, EU sources told Reuters.  Germany has commercial interests, but it needs to explain itself,  one senior EU official said. With the pipeline expected to reroute Russian gas supplies around Ukraine to the north, Italy voiced concerns it would increase gas prices for customers further down the line. Eastern European and Baltic states fear it will increase their dependence on Gazprom and undercut Ukraine. Nordic nations, meanwhile, have security concerns over the pipeline being laid near their shores under the Baltic Sea, where Russia has bolstered its military presence. However, many EU nations have yet to take a stand.  It is quite toxic. Many member states are quite wary of advertising their position,  one diplomat told Reuters. There are also differences among EU member states over what aims to pursue in potential talks with Russia. Speaking in Paris on Monday, Ukraine's foreign minister said the draft EU proposal did not go far enough to secure guarantees from Russia, warning Nord Stream 2 would have  dangerous consequences  for the bloc. Adding to tensions is the threat of new U.S. sanctions on Russia that would penalise Western firms involved in Nord Stream 2: Uniper, Wintershall, Shell, OMV and Engie. Several EU diplomats said the measures proposed by the U.S. Senate have already backfired against their stated aim of bolstering European energy security.  It's a divisive measure,  one senior official said.  It's easy for the U.S. to go after Russian gas of course, they don't use it. ... We are trying to make the best of a bad thing by balancing the interest of different member states.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms in China. In December 2010, Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his activism promoting human rights in China, causing Beijing to freeze diplomatic ties with Norway. China and Norway normalized ties in December last year.     Mo Shaoping, Liu's lawyer, told Reuters that Liu was being treated for late-stage liver cancer in Shenyang and that medical parole had been approved. He did not elaborate. The prison bureau of Liaoning province, where Shenyang is located, confirmed the medical parole in a short statement on its website, adding that Liu was being treated by eight people it described as  well-known tumor experts . The public security ministry and justice ministry did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment. A man who answered the telephone at the Shenyang hospital where Liu is being treated said he could not check information on individual cases as there were too many patients there. Tibetan writer and family friend Tsering Woeser said she had been in tears after reading online reports of Liu's illness.  I'm shocked and deeply saddened,  she told Reuters.  All we can do now is pray for him.  Liu Xia, Liu's wife, who has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize, is suffering from depression but has been allowed to visit him in prison about once a month, a source close to the dissident told Reuters. Liu was not allowed to attend his father-in-law's funeral last year and his mother-in-law's funeral this year, said the source who asked not to be identified.  Liu had been incarcerated at Jinzhou Penitentiary in Liaoning, his home province in northeast China, before being moved to the hospital for treatment.       FILE PHOTO: Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo is seen in this undated photo released by his families. Handout viaFile Photo'Incredibly Sad' In Oslo, the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee which awards the peace prize strongly criticized Beijing.  The committee is pleased that Liu Xiaobo is out of prison, but at the same time regrets in the strongest terms that it took a serious illness before the Chinese authorities agreed to release him,  it said in a rare statement.  He was in reality sentenced for exercising his freedom of expression and should never have been jailed,  it added, reiterating a standing invitation for Liu to come to Norway. Rights group Amnesty International also confirmed the news of Liu's illness. Patrick Poon, a China researcher for Amnesty, said on Twitter that the diagnosis was made on May 23. William Nee, also of Amnesty, said authorities should ensure Liu was getting adequate medical care and he called for the immediate and unconditional release of Liu and his wife.  Obviously, it's a shameful situation and it's incredibly sad to see one of China's most prominent intellectuals suffer from such a terrible illness when he never should've been detained in the first place,  Nee said. He also called for the Nobel Committee and the international community to speak up  forcefully  for Liu now. Supporters, many of whom have been campaigning for Liu's release for years, took to Twitter and other platforms to express sadness at the news of his illness and denounce the Chinese government's treatment of him. Activists have flagged numerous cases of abuse in detention over the years, including denial of medical treatment for political activists, charges generally disputed by the government.  There have been lots of similar cases where the individual was released on medical parole just before they die,  well-known and outspoken activist Hu Jia told Reuters. China has acknowledged problems of mistreatment in the criminal justice system and has repeatedly vowed to crack down to address them.

The justices ruled in favor of lesbian couples by throwing out a December ruling by the Arkansas Supreme Court decision that upheld state officials' refusal to name the wives of the birth mothers as parents on birth certificates. The Arkansas court said state officials do not have to list both same-sex spouses as named parents on birth certificates, even though state law allows a birth mother's opposite-sex husband to be listed when the baby is not biologically related to him. Both couples received the birth certificates they wanted when they won in trial court. Conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented, saying the lower court decision should not have been reversed. Two gay married couples who live in Arkansas, Marisa and Terrah Pavan and Leigh and Jana Jacobs, were turned down by the Arkansas Department of Health to include both parents' names on their babies' birth certificates. In each case, only the birth parent was listed on the certificate. Both couples sued in state court, and a trial judge ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide required that the same-sex spouses be named on the birth certificates. The Obergefell decision noted that the denial of the  constellation of benefits that the states have linked to marriage,  including birth certificates, harms same-sex couples. The couples received their amended birth certificate documents, but the state appealed. Last December, the top Arkansas court overturned the trial judge's ruling, saying that the Obergefell ruling was limited to marriage itself and did not apply to birth certificates. The state court said the birth certificate law did not violate the guarantee of equal protection under the U.S. Constitution because it was intended to record biological relationships, not marital ones.  It does not violate equal protection to acknowledge basic biological truths,  the state court said. The couples urged the Supreme Court to review the case, saying the Arkansas law requires opposite-sex husbands to be listed on birth certificates even if the baby is conceived through artificial insemination with donated sperm. The Obergefell decision not only requires states to allow same-sex couples to marry, they added, but to receive the same marriage-related benefits. The state argued that its law records accurate information about biological parentage, which could be important to a child for future health-related reasons. The state has conceded in court that the state's separate law concerning birth certificates for children born using artificial insemination is likely unconstitutional because it allows the male spouse in a heterosexual relationship to be listed on a birth certificate even when he has no biological relationship with the child. Several civil rights groups filed legal papers supporting the couples. Lambda Legal, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, said that despite the Obergefell decision several states have continued for force couples to sue to add same-sex spouses to birth certificates.

The 26-year-old, whose rise from obscurity to a Center Court date with Roger Federer captured the nation's imagination, began his 2017 odyssey by defeating Slovakia's Andrej Martin 7-5 7-5 in the first qualifying round.  This time last year, Willis embarked on a run that saw him come through pre-qualifying, qualifying and the first round of the main draw before the adventure was finally ended by Federer, who was happy to play a supporting role to the happy-go-lucky Willis. The story of the club coach who had been about to give up the sport until his girlfriend Jennifer persuaded him to carry on captured the headlines last year as his noisy fan club cheered on 'Will Bomb' at courtside. Now the world No.374 Willis is hoping to reprise his 2016 achievements, starting off his campaign to make the main draw next week by defeating Martin, who is ranked 226 places higher. Just as last year, though, Willis, who must win three rounds to make the singles draw even though he has been given a wild card to compete in the doubles, made a nonsense of the rankings with his backhand slice and grasscourt nous earning him crucial breaks at 5-5 in both sets. Asked if it had been an emotional return to the qualifying venue a few miles from Wimbledon, Willis told the BBC:  I was a bit nervy at the start. You have to just forget it. As soon as emotions get involved, you can crumble.  It's very easy to choke under the pressure. That's what I've been doing well to avoid.  There is also a new plotline in Willis's 2017 story. After last year's event, he got married and has become a father to baby Martha, who was at courtside with mother Jennifer on Monday.  Martha's my lucky mascot,  he said.  She doesn't have a clue what's going on but as long as she's got her milk, she's fine!

Trump,Edward Peruta,Neil Gorsuch,US,USA,COURT,GUNS,United States","sector":"News - Politics","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sidestepped one of the most hotly contested gun rights disputes in years, declining to rule in a California case on whether a person's constitutional right to keep firearms for self-defense extends outside the home.  Gun owners had taken aim at a California law that bars them from being granted a permit to carry a concealed gun in public places unless they show  good cause  for having it, with county sheriffs making the determination. The justices let stand a lower court's ruling upholding a San Diego County sheriff's policy of denying such permits unless the gun owner documents a need for self-defense. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the policy last year, finding that the U.S. Constitution offers no right to carry a concealed weapon.  Two conservative justices, including President Donald Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, said the court should have heard the case. The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment guarantees the right to  keep and bear arms.  In its landmark 2008 District of Columbia v. Heller ruling, the Supreme Court held for the first time that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual's right to bear arms for self-defense in the home. The California plaintiffs were aiming to extend that right outside the home. Conservative Supreme Court justices generally have been receptive to an expansive view of gun rights, with liberals skeptical. The court has five conservative justices, including Gorsuch, and four liberals. California law generally forbids the carrying of handguns, either open or concealed, in public spaces. Lead plaintiff Edward Peruta, a San Diego County resident, applied for a concealed carry license, but was rejected because he had not specifically shown he was in harm's way. Peruta and four others sued San Diego County in a case backed by a California affiliate of the National Rifle Association gun rights group. The state intervened in support of the county. The plaintiffs argued that the sheriff's definition of  good cause  violated the Second Amendment. Law-abiding citizens should be able to carry weapons in public for the general purpose of self-defense, the plaintiffs argued.  Last June, the appeals court ruled that the Second Amendment does not protect the right to carry concealed firearms in public. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-guns-idUSL1N1JN0I2"},

While the long-awaited report, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, concludes the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) is fit for service, EDF may have to replace its vessel cover soon after its scheduled start-up in 2018. The requirement is a major blow for EDF, which will have to start planning for a costly replacement of a key part before the reactor even starts up. The reputational damage could also add to concerns in Britain about its 18 billion pound ($23 billion) project to build two similar EPR reactors in southwest England. The French regulator had ordered a deep review of the Flamanville vessel following the discovery in 2015 of carbon concentrations in the base and cover of the containment vessel, which make its steel more brittle. The report - led by the IRSN, the ASN's technical arm - is being reviewed by a group of independent experts on Monday and Tuesday. This autumn, ASN will partly base its final ruling on Flamanville on the experts' recommendations. The ASN report states that while the base of the vessel is fit for service despite the need for increased monitoring over its lifetime, manufacturer Areva NP has not been able to conduct sufficient tests on the cover as it is no longer accessible. These controls are indispensable in order to ensure the reactor's safety over its 60-year lifetime, the report says. It adds that the technical dossier handed to the ASN by Areva NP and EDF about the follow-up controls is brief and gives no information about the feasibility of these tests.  The (regulator) considers that the current cover of the Flamanville reactor is not fit for service in a permanent manner given the absence of sufficient non-destructive tests,  the Autorité de sûreté nucléaire's (ASN) report says.  Therefore, the (regulator) considers that the use of the current reactor cover of the Flamanville EPR cannot be envisaged beyond a few years of operation without the necessary controls ... having been put in place,  it says. The report adds EDF has committed to analyse, at the end of 2025, the conclusions of technical feasibility studies and new test procedures, and that in the event of negative conclusions, it will replace the cover during the reactor's first ten-year review. ASN notes that covers of other EDF reactors have been replaced in past years. It adds that, according to Areva NP, a cover could be replaced in less than 80 months, meaning a new cover  could be available before the end of 2024 if it is ordered in 2017 . Areva NP's Creusot Forge foundry, which made the base and cover, is currently closed following the discovery of manufacturing flaws and falsification of documentation and is awaiting ASN approval to restart. BFM TV said on its website that EDF had been expecting ASN to ask it to replace the Flamanville reactor cover and it had already ordered the manufacturing of the new piece, with the replacement scheduled for 2021. The ASN and EDF declined to comment. The European Commission has said the ASN's green light for the Flamanville reactor vessel is a precondition for EU approval of the recapitalisation of Areva and the planned sale of its reactor division Areva NP to EDF. In recent months, EDF has said several times that Flamanville will start up in 2018, six years behind schedule. Its cost was last estimated at 10.5 billion euros ($11.8 billion) in September 2015, compared with an initial estimate of 3 billion euros in 2004. Another EPR under construction in Finland is also years behind schedule and billions over budget. The first of two EPRs under construction in China, also delayed, might go into service this year. EDF said on Monday it was reviewing costs and deadlines for Britain's Hinkley Point project after Le Monde reported on Saturday it was set for a 1-3 billion euro budget overrun and completion could be delayed by two years to 2027. $1 = 0.7853 pounds Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/edf-flamanville-nuclear-idUSL8N1JN2OC"},

A U.S. investigation into whether foreign-made steel imports pose a rise to U.S. national security is nearly done. The focus is mainly cheap imports from China, but EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom said EU industry could be damaged in the process.  We would have to see if that measure is in compliance with the WTO of course and if it hits us like it could we will of course retaliate. Exactly how and when I will not answer now, but we are making preparations,  EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom told a news conference. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the president to impose restrictions for reasons of national security and has only been used twice before, to investigate oil in 1999 and iron and steel in 2001. The Trump administration has started a similar investigation into imports of aluminium.  If worse comes to worse, that there would be a general inclusion of steel tariffs under this 232 provision, that would be very bad for Europe. We are a friend and ally of the United States and we feel we would be unjustifiably hit by this,  Malmstrom said. The EU trade chief said she understood U.S. concerns about steel overcapacity in China and was prepared to work with the Americans to tackle this issue. Malmstrom was speaking at the presentation of an EU report on barriers to trade and investment. It found that 36 new obstacles had been created by trading partners in 2016, an increase of about 10 percent, with the greatest increases due to measures in Russia, India, Switzerland and China. Malmstrom said the EU would urge leaders at the upcoming G20 summit in Hamburg on July 7-8 to resist protectionism. Financial leaders of the world's biggest economies in March dropped a pledge to keep global trade free and open, acquiescing to an increasingly protectionist United States.

Open Fiber, the broadband business owned by Italy's biggest utility Enel and state lender CDP, has been seeking to do deals with utilities across Italy as it takes on rival phone group Telecom Italia in its network investments. A deal with Acea -- which runs power, public lighting and water supplies in Rome -- would allow Open Fiber to cable up to some 1.5 million users, one of the sources said.

However, Seattle Genetics' shares fell 11 percent as investors were unimpressed by the difference in the progression free survival rate of patients on the combination therapy testing the companies' Adcetris drug and the control arm. The study testing the combination as an initial treatment for advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma showed 82.1 percent lower risk of cancer progression in patients, compared with 77.2 percent in the control arm. The control arm used standard-of-care chemotherapy, ABVD, which combines adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine drugs. The relatively modest improvement of about 5 percent could generate cost concerns among payers, but the benefit from removing bleomycin from the treatment regimen could be substantial, particularly for younger patients, SunTrust Bank analyst Yatin Suneja said. Doctors for long have been trying to get rid of bleomycin from the chemotherapy regimen to increase the long-term durable response rate and decrease toxicity, Seattle Genetics Chief Executive Clay Siegall told Reuters. Adcetris is approved in the United States to treat patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, who have already received a stem cell transplant or two chemotherapies. The drug is also approved to treat anaplastic large cell lymphoma in patients who have undergone chemotherapy. Adcetris, known chemically as brentuximab vedotin, links a tumor-targeting antibody to a cancer-killing chemotherapy drug with the goal of limiting side effects. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in white blood cells. It typically begins in the lymph nodes in one region of the body and then spreads throughout the lymph system. According to the American Cancer Society, about 8,260 Americans were diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma so far in 2017, out of which about 1,070 died. The U.S. drug developer, which partnered with Takeda to co-develop and commercialize Adcetris outside the United States, said it would file for an expanded label in the United States as soon as possible. The drug, which generated about $266 million in North America sales last year, is also being developed in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's immunotherapy, Opdivo, to treat relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Apple's 1.1 percent rise was the biggest boost to all the three major indexes. The S&P; tech index's 0.67 percent rise lead the gainers among the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors. Adding to the sentiment was a rise in European shares, driven by Italian banks gaining after a deal to wind up two failed lenders. Oil edged up for the third straight session but gains were capped by the relentless rise in U.S. supply and bloated global inventories. The recent drop in oil prices has spurred concerns about low inflation, which stubbornly remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target rate. The central bank raised rates this month for the second time this year and is expected to raise it again. Futures imply only a 50 percent chance of another rate hike by December. On Monday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said the Fed needs to raise rates gradually or the economy runs the risk of overheating. New York Fed chief William Dudley said recent narrowing of credit spreads, record stock prices and falling bond yields could encourage the Fed to continue tightening U.S. policy.  The Fed policymakers had been broadly hawkish last week, and most of them anticipate another rate hike in 2017 (most likely in December),  said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.  However, fixed-income markets are saying it's over for this year as they don't see inflationary pressures coming anytime soon. It's still too far from December, but oil prices will play a significant role on how interest rates go from here.

The 10 new graves announced by the military on Monday bring to 52 the total number of such sites found in the Kasai region since the start of an insurrection last August by the Kamuina Nsapu militia which wants the withdrawal of military forces from the area. Army prosecutor General Joseph Ponde told reporters in the capital Kinshasa that Kamuina Nsapu fighters were suspected of dumping bodies in the graves in Kasai province. The government also blamed the militia for mass graves discovered in neighboring Kasai-Central province. But witnesses in Kasai-Central interviewed in March by Reuters said they had seen army trucks dumping bodies. Bodies have not been exhumed from the newly found graves -discovered by Red Cross workers - and there are no estimates of the number of people buried in them.  More than 3,000 people have been killed in fighting between government forces and Kamuina Nsapu, according to the local Catholic church. Another 1.3 million have fled their homes in an insurgency which poses the most serious threat to the rule of President Joseph Kabila who refused to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate in December. The United Nations' human rights chief last week accused a militia with links to the government of murdering and mutilating civilians in Kasai. Congolese authorities deny those charges. Last week, the U.N. Human Rights Council approved an international investigation into the violence, though Congolese authorities insist U.N. investigators will only be providing technical assistance.

Oil edged up for a third straight session, climbing off last week's seven-month lows, but gains were capped by a relentless rise in U.S. supply and bloated global inventories.

Rio's mines in Australia's Hunter Valley region are attractive to both Glencore and China because the quality of their coal means it is likely to continue to be burned even as concerns about emissions deter generators from using poorer quality coal, which is the most polluting of all. Yancoal increased its offer to $2.69 billion from $2.45 billion, adding $240 million in unconditional guaranteed royalty payments to a cash offer of $2.45 billion.   The revised offer from Yancoal of $2.69 billion offers compelling value to our shareholders,  Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a statement.  Glencore on Friday had raised its offer to $2.675 billion in cash, looking to beat Yancoal's earlier offer of $2.45 billion.  Glencore said its bid would lapse if Rio Tinto did not declare it to be superior by June 26.  On Monday, it declined comment on Rio Tinto's decision to stick with Yancoal. Rio Tinto said Yancoal offered a faster and more certain timetable, with the deal likely to be wrapped up during the third quarter of 2017, compared with the first half of 2018 at the earliest for the Glencore deal.

Yancoal continues to provide Rio Tinto with the certainty of approvals and funding required to facilitate the efficient and timely sale of the Coal & Allied assets,  Yancoal Chairman Xiyong Li said in a statement. Yancoal, though based in Australia, is 78 percent owned by China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Company. The logo of commodities trader Glencore is pictured in front of the company's headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, September 30, 2015.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoThe sale includes a major stake in the Port Waratah coal-loading facility in Newcastle port, from where most of Australia's thermal coal departs for overseas markets. Both Glencore and Yancoal want to buy Rio Tinto's mines to operate alongside existing operations, looking to sell high quality thermal coal to power generators in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea that are under pressure to become more efficient and to lower emissions.  In raising its offer last week, Glencore said it would sell assets to ensure its debt level remained modest. Analyst Edward Sterck of BMO Capital Markets said if Glencore's higher bid had been accepted, it could reduce the company's flexibility to pursue its goal of expanding its agriculture business. Rio Tinto will now hold shareholder meetings on Tuesday in London and on Thursday in Sydney to allow shareholders to vote on the deal. Glencore's share price rose 0.5 percent by 1325 GMT, while Rio rose 1 percent.

Buying into companies based on environmental, social and governance factors, has become a hot trend on Wall Street, spawning a new industry that sells investors company ratings based on those factors and funds dedicated to rated companies. However, some investors and funds may rely too much on the scores of one rating firm, said Dan Hanson, a portfolio manager at Jarislowsky Fraser Global Investment Management.    The scores are in some cases being used in a way they are not really designed for,  Hanson said.  It's problematic to bolt them on to an investment process.   There are no set criteria for who is bad and who is good and so-called ESG ratings vary widely, meaning investors may be less protected than they think, for example, from a scandal over labor practices or board pay.  We don't have a common vernacular,  said Asha Mehta, director of responsible investing at Acadian Asset Management in Boston. Sustainability analysis firm CSRHub compared such ratings  given to companies in the S&P; Global 1200 index by two leading firms in the field - a division of MSCI Inc, and Toronto-based Sustainalytics - and found they had a correlation coefficient of 0.32, a relatively weak level.  Credit ratings, in contrast, are closely aligned, with the comparable figure for Moody’s and S&P; ratings of around 0.9, according to research by Northern Illinois University finance professor Lei Zhou.  The difference is that credit ratings rely on financial disclosures while the sustainability ratings may reflect different weightings given to factors such as workers' rights, emissions, or responses to events such as an oil spill or product failure.  Electric car maker Tesla, for example, has received a top AAA score from MSCI, but a middling grade from Sustainalytics, below that of traditional automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors , partly because Tesla does not release carbon emissions data for its manufacturing plants. Tesla declined to comment. In interviews, a dozen professional investors and company executives told Reuters they were frustrated by the lack of common standards, even as many praised the work of the ratings firms individually.  The New York Stock Exchange is seen from the steps of Federal Hall behind a Statue of former U.S. President George Washington in New York City, U.S., May 17, 2017.Brendan McDermidCommon Language One remedy, they say, would be to adopt a common language and reporting requirements. Starting next year, the European Union will require companies to report on their efforts in such areas as the environment and social responsibility. In the United States, a small group of companies, such as JetBlue Airways Corp, has embraced voluntary disclosures suggested by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, an independent organization. As more and more investors recognize the long-term financial benefits of good corporate governance and sustainable policies, the need for uniform criteria becomes more pressing. The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment estimates that more than $8 trillion was invested by U.S. fund managers who incorporated at least some of such criteria in their strategy, up from $1.4 trillion in 2012.     CSRHub counts 17 firms and organizations that track in some form corporate adherence to environmental, social and governance standards, including Thomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters.     At their best, rating firms can help investors avoid losses. For instance, both MSCI and Sustainalytics raised governance concerns about Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) months before the German automaker admitted to cheating on U.S. diesel emissions tests in September 2015.      “They absolutely called that right,” said Seb Beloe, head of sustainability research at WHEB Asset Management in London.     But there is also a risk that they will miss red flags because non-financial information is less readily available and open to interpretation. Simon MacMahon, who oversees ESG research at Sustainalytics, acknowledged sustainability can be difficult to define.  We're talking about a whole host of issues here.  Yet Linda-Eling Lee, head of ESG research at MSCI, said few executives object to its findings.     It's only a handful of companies where we have a back and forth,  she said. Some companies take advantage of the disparities to focus on ratings that are more favorable, said Robert Fernandez, director of ESG research for Breckinridge Capital Advisors in Boston.  You can certainly see how it's a concern that they have divergent views,  he said.      The absence of a common standard has not stopped Wall Street. While larger investment firms usually combine ratings with their own research, some funds are built largely off ratings, even if sponsors acknowledge they may be imperfect. For example, a disclosure from one of the largest, the $866 million iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF, run by BlackRock and based on MSCI ratings notes among its risk factors the chance MSCI might not pick companies with the right  ESG  characteristics.  Lynn Blake, a top investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, said the divergence in ratings, while warranting some caution, may ultimately make little difference for large, diverse portfolios.      We believe they are 'good enough,' particularly for broad universe index funds,  Blake said via e-mail.     The case of Tesla, shows how ratings can reflect differences in approach rather than any flaws in analysis or data.    In its report, Sustainalytics acknowledged CEO Elon Musk's goal of making Tesla's  Gigafactory  built in Nevada entirely powered by renewable energy. Yet it still gave the company an overall score of 55 out of 100 for not disclosing data on the carbon emissions from its automaking operations.       Their lack of corporate sustainability reporting is kind of a shame, especially considering their main product is a low-carbon product,  Sustainalytics' MacMahon said.     Similarly, MSCI rated Tesla 5.3 on a 10-point scale for  carbon emissions,  including its own operations. But that score did not dent Tesla's overall top AAA grade because MSCI gave more weight to other factors, such as emissions of Tesla cars, said MSCI's Lee. Ultimately the firm decides on what to focus on to make the rating more meaningful for investors, she said.      You could give three percent (importance) to lots of issues and at the end of the day, everything averages out,  Lee said.

The trip by Leni Robredo to an evacuation center in Balo-i for residents who escaped a month-long conflict in nearby Marawi City adds to speculation about the health of 72-year-old President Rodrigo Duterte, whose absence this month from the public eye is the longest since he took office a year ago. Known for a packed public schedule and marathon speeches several times a day, Duterte's disappearances during what has been the biggest crisis of his presidency will add to frequent rumors he is in poor health, which his office denies. Robredo made no mention of Duterte during her visit, when she said she hoped life for the nearly 250,000 people displaced by fighting between troops and rebels allied with the Islamic State group could soon return to normal.  All of us are hoping that the fighting will soon end so the people can go back to their respective homes,  she told reporters.  The government has been doing everything that we can. We can only hope that this will end soon.  Duterte's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on his lengthy absence.  Salvador Panelo, a longtime friend of Duterte's and his top legal advisor, said the president was as  strong as a bull  and would attend a public event and meet cabinet members on Tuesday. Duterte was last seen on June 20 in two cities close to Marawi, when he met soldiers and evacuees. That followed a three-day absence after a speech in which he said his health was  immaterial , amid raised eyebrows about his failure to show in public for Independence Day on June 12. His office has said he has been experiencing fatigue, and his aide Christopher  Bong  Go on June 15 posted images on social media of Duterte signing documents, and standing in front of a television showing a news bulletin. Battles Resume A evacuated mother Rohanifa carries her 2-weeks-old baby Raifah who was born at the evacuation center outside Marawi, while government forces still fighting insurgents from the Maute group in Marawi, Philippines June 26, 2017.Jorge SilvaFighting resumed in Marawi on Monday, a day after a unilateral truce was declared by the military for eight hours to mark the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday and try to rescue civilians trapped in the conflict zone. Air strikes and gunfights took place early in the day and the military said it believed insurgents from Maute group were flagging after a fifth week of clashes, with infighting among the remaining leaders. The resilience and the level of organization of the Maute group and its affiliates has caused consternation in the region about the extent to which Islamic State's extremist agenda may have gained traction in the southern Philippines, a region more familiar with banditry and separatism than radical ideology. Slideshow (10 Images)Duterte had long warned that it was only a matter of time before there would be an Islamic State contamination. The battle for Marawi has claimed the lives of 70 servicemen, 27 civilians and 290 militants, according to official figures. Fleeing residents and some local disaster officials believe many more civilians may have been killed while trapped in areas battered by artillery and air strikes, and infested with Maute snipers. Witnesses have reported seeing bodies in the streets for days, some decomposing. The military said it was concerned about reports of the possible beheading of hostages, or captives being forced to take up arms against government troops. Spokesman Jo-Ar Herrera said soldiers were committed to finishing the job and saving residents, 13 of which were rescued on Sunday.  Our offensive operations have resumed and will continue so we can liberate Marawi in the soonest time possible,  he told reporters.  We are focused and committed and will accomplish our mission.

It comes as drugmakers face global pressure over the high cost of prescription medicines, with particular anger focused on makers of older generic products who exploit limited competition to force through big price rises. The European Commission's move last month to investigate if Aspen Pharmacare made  unjustified  hikes of up to several hundred percent in the cost of five old cancer drugs puts the EU executive in the vanguard of such enforcement.  In the past, the Commission has acted on specific market abuses, such as agreements between manufacturers of branded drugs and generics firms to delay the entry of cheaper copies. The latest broad charge of excessive pricing, also described by Brussels as  price gouging , potentially sets a precedent for more direct action, especially if officials rely on a formula for what is a reasonable or justified profit margin.      It's a huge threat to the industry and companies should be watching this closely,  said Gianni De Stefano at law firm Hogan Lovells.  Normally, in Europe, drug companies just have to negotiate with a national regulator on pricing. Now there is the prospect of additional European-level oversight and that is scary for the industry.  South Africa-based Aspen, which says it is committed to fair and open competition, could be fined up to 10 percent of its global turnover, or some $290 million, if found guilty by EU antitrust regulators. Adrian van den Hoven, director general of the Medicines for Europe industry group representing generic drugmakers, is worried about the implications of the EU probe, while stressing he in no way condones any anti-competitive behavior.  The investigation may be needed to stop bad behavior,  he told Reuters.  However, this should not lead to a set of fixed principles that are not adapted to different situations, which then creates additional risks and which could increase the pressure on companies to withdraw important older medicines that patients need.   Unfair  Prices EU law bans  unfair  prices, and the Aspen case follows controversy over U.S. market price hikes by the likes of Valeant and Turing Pharmaceuticals, previously headed by Martin Shkreli. Shkreli, now on trial for fraud, was pilloried in 2015 for increasing the cost of an anti-parasitic medicine by more than 5,000 percent. Maarten Meulenbelt, partner at law firm Sidley Austin, said the European Commission might be trying to fire a warning shot to make drug firms more cautious, rather than wanting to extend its remit into price regulation. There certainly appear to be grounds for concern. A study by British academics in January found European prices for several off-patent cancer drugs had risen by more than 100 percent in the past five years. National authorities have also been taking a more aggressive stance, with Italy's competition authorities fining Aspen $5.5 million last year over its cancer drugs and British regulators imposing a record fine of $107 million on Pfizer for steep price increases for an old epilepsy medicine.   But Miguel de la Mano, a former European Commission competition economist who now works at consultancy Compass Lexecon, said price increases even of several multiples were not necessarily evidence of market abuse.  The Commission should proceed with extreme caution,  he said. The focus on excessive pricing comes at a time when there are also concerns about occasional shortages of some hospital drugs, due to production problems, unexpected spikes in demand and a limited number of suppliers. The Aspen case centers on five drugs used in hospitals that are no longer protected by patents, which the firm originally acquired from GlaxoSmithKline. Some lawyers believe the same principles could in future be applied to patented drugs, although Fiona Carlin, partner at Baker McKenzie, doubts the Aspen probe signals more intervention on innovative medicines, since officials will not want to take action that could undermine innovation incentives. Any move to analyze a medicine's price based on cost plus a margin would go against the grain of the industry's drive to tie drug prices to clinical value - a key message for companies in the face of public disquiet about their marketing strategies.

But they worry about officials' ability to implement reforms and about geopolitical tensions in the region. The Saudi stock market jumped 7 percent in the two days after Mohammed bin Salman, previously deputy crown prince, was appointed last week to be first in line for the throne. Part of the market's rise was due to a decision by index compiler MSCI to consider upgrading Riyadh to emerging market status. But much of the euphoria was political; shares in companies closely linked to Prince Mohammed's reforms were the top performers. National Commercial Bank, the biggest lender, which is expected to play a big role handling financial transactions related to the reforms, surged 15 percent. Miner Ma'aden soared 20 percent; Prince Mohammed has labelled mining a key sector in his drive to cut Saudi Arabia's reliance on oil exports. Emaar the Economic City , builder of an industrial zone which the prince hopes to develop as an export industry base, gained 16 percent. Business leaders said the promotion of Prince Mohammed, 31, removed political uncertainty by confirming a smooth shift of power from an older generation of Saudi leaders to a young generation represented by the prince.  The political transition was very smooth - we expect the reforms to continue,  Muhammad Alagil, chairman of Jarir Marketing, a top retailing chain, told Reuters. He said Jarir, which has 47 stores, some 39 of which are in Saudi, would open at least six this year and a similar number next year, mostly inside Saudi Arabia. To some in business, Prince Mohammed represents fresh opportunity in the form of a $200 billion privatisation programme and state investment to help kick start new industries such as shipbuilding, auto parts making and tourism. Some executives predicted the progress of these plans, which are still largely on the drawing board a year after Prince Mohammed announced them, would accelerate after his promotion. “I didn’t see a risk of the reforms stalling or being reversed before, given the political backing behind them. But now the reforms can go ahead with more strength,  said Hesham Abo Jamee, chief executive at Alistithmar Capital. He added that social initiatives in the reforms would help the economy by stimulating consumer spending. For example, developing an entertainment sector, in a conservative society which has so far shunned many forms of public entertainment, would create jobs. The government plans an entertainment zone south of Riyadh with sports, cultural and recreational facilities. Increasing the role of women in the workforce would boost family incomes and could accelerate creation of small businesses such as restaurants, Abo Jamee said. Repatriation Prince Mohammed is also architect of a tough austerity policy, including spending cuts and tax rises, that aims to abolish by 2020 a budget gap which totalled $79 billion in 2016. The austerity has slowed private sector growth almost to zero. But many in business see austerity as inevitable in an era of low oil prices and are pleased by the prince's willingness to moderate it to avoid a worse slowdown. To mark his promotion, Riyadh retroactively restored civil servants' allowances at a cost it estimated at around $1.5 billion. Privately, many executives expect Prince Mohammed to persuade or pressure wealthy Saudis to repatriate some of the billions of dollars which they are believed to have transferred overseas for safe-keeping. It is not clear what tools he would use - moral suasion, legal action or financial incentives - but his promotion may have given him the political capital for such a sensitive step. Businesses remain worried by two other issues, however. One is the competence of the bureaucracy to carry out the complex reforms. The government talks of partnerships between the public and private sectors to finance projects, for example, but has not released legal frameworks for such deals.  Many of the reforms are in name only - nothing has happened. They're struggling with the details,  said a foreign economist who advises the Saudi government. The other big worry is rising tensions around Saudi Arabia - tensions in which Prince Mohammed has been closely involved in his role as defence minister for two years. In addition to its military intervention in Yemen, Saudi Arabia is locked in a diplomatic confrontation with Iran, its allies are struggling in Syria's civil war, and early this month it cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar. For some in business, these tensions are at best a distraction for the government at a time when it needs to focus on the economy, and at worst risk a more serious regional crisis that could deter foreign investment and endanger the reforms.

The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.2 percent.                  “The data is pretty bad,” said Thomas Simons, a senior money market economist at Jefferies in New York.     Benchmark 10-year notes             were last up 2/32 in price to yield 2.137 percent, down from 2.144 percent late on Friday. Thirty-year bond yields             fell to 2.70 percent, the lowest since Nov. 9.     The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                fell to 94.60 basis points, the flattest since late 2007.     The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve speakers including New York Fed President William Dudley have indicated further monetary policy tightening is likely, weighing on short- and intermediate-dated debt.     Long bonds, by contrast, have been supported by concerns about tepid growth and falling inflation.     “Inflation is the key,” said Simons. “Until oil moves meaningfully higher and people start to get convinced that inflation is going to come back, this curve flattening is going to continue.”     Financial conditions have loosened in the past year despite the Fed raising interest rates three times since December, which is another reason to continue tightening, Dudley said in remarks published on Monday.

Thomas Hollande, the son of former French President Francois Hollande who was acting as a lawyer for Tati's employees, said the deal would save the bulk of jobs at Tati and keep the brand alive.  This offer will let around 85 percent of staff stay on, which is more than most could have hoped for,  Hollande told reporters. The full financial terms of the takeover were not disclosed. Family-controlled retailer Eram had said earlier this year that it had decided to sell its loss-making Agora Distribution unit, which owns the Tati brand amongst others. Tati, which is well-known in France for its bright pink logo, started in 1948 in Paris when Jules Ouaki, a Tunisian and a pioneer in the low-cost textile market, opened the first store on boulevard de Rochechouart in the Barbes immigrant district of northern Paris, just downhill from the Sacre Coeur. However, it had been racking up losses amid increasing competition from low-cost fashion retail giants such as H&M; (HMb.ST), Zara (ITX.MC) and Primark (ABF.L). Eram had already tried to sell it in 2015. Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Brian Love","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-fashion-tati-idUSKBN19H1I1"},

The announcement comes days after the government announced the bank would need a further capital injection of $1.5 billion to stay afloat. CEO Oleksandr Shlapak  soon plans to complete his anti-crisis tenure,  the bank said in a statement that praised Shlapak's role in stabilising the lender after it was placed under state control. The bank's board will decide whether to accept his resignation at a meeting at the end of July, it said. Neither PrivatBank nor the finance ministry, which controls the lender, gave detailed reasons for the resignation. Shlapak is seen as a possible contender to take over the reins as central bank governor after Valeria Gontareva resigned in May, leaving her deputy in temporary charge. PrivatBank was taken under state control with the backing of Ukraine's top creditor, the International Monetary Fund, after risky lending practices left it with a capital shortfall of more than $5.5 billion. The nationalisation has so far cost taxpayers $4.3 billion, but an Ernst and Young audit of the lender's 2016 annual report showed that, as forecast by the central bank, additional funds were needed to meet capital adequacy requirements. This will be a further burden on Ukraine's already strained public finances and will mean more has been spent on recapitalising PrivatBank since December than the annual defence budget amid a long-running conflict with Russia-backed rebels.  I am grateful to Oleksandr Shlapak for his important contribution to stabilizing the bank,  said Ukrainian Finance Minister Oleksandr Danylyuk in a statement.  The next leader should be a professional who will continue to develop the bank, attract investors and prepare the bank for a transparent privatization in the future.

Most banks will likely wait for loan growth to pick up before making any meaningful change to offered rates. While online banking may prove an exception, deposit rate competition should still be contained in this segment. Deposit costs have moved little despite the Fed Funds target rate being raised a cumulative 75bps to 1.25% since December 2016. Substantial excess deposits in the system and low loan demand have likely been the key factors keeping deposit betas - the share of a fed rate hike passed on to depositors - low for a protracted period. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogram.com/us_bank_deposit_costs_change?src=embed  title= US Bank Deposit Costs Change  width= 550  height= 715  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > Fitch estimated excess deposits of $1.35 trillion at end-2016. Recent Federal Reserve data is also showing deposit growth exceeding loan growth for the first time since mid-2014 while the loans/deposit ratio remains low relative to the historic average. This has resulted in the average median cost of interest-bearing deposits for traditional commercial banks in the U.S. rising by less than 10bps over the past two years. The median cost of interest bearing deposits for traditional commercial banks ranged from 30bps to just under 50bps at end-1Q17 depending on asset size. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogram.com/us_loans_to_deposit_ratio?src=embed  title= US Loans to Deposit Ratio  width= 550  height= 646  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > Fitch believes that a rise in deposit betas and absolute deposit costs is inevitable despite the recent trends. We maintain our view that U.S. interest rates will normalize faster than consensus expectations and that the latest rate hike on June 14 underscores that the Fed is on-track for an additional 25bps hike by end-2017 with continued steady increases in 2018 and 2019. Rising deposit costs, in the context of broader rate normalization, should not have a major credit or ratings impact. Rising interest rates should generally benefit bank earnings through rate-sensitive assets and as they could contribute to higher earning asset growth, though this will depend on individual banks' balance sheets. It is also important to note that sustained rate hikes do not always contribute to net interest margin (NIM) expansion if the yield curve flattens. NIMs compressed during the last rate hiking cycle from 2004-2006 and Fitch notes that the yield curve has flattened since December 2016 as long-end yields have steadily fallen while short-end rates have risen with the policy rate hikes. In mid-June 2016, the yield curve was the flattest it has been in two years with the spread between three-month T-bills and ten-year Treasuries at just 114bps. U.S. banks have not experienced a sustained rate hiking cycle since 2004-2006 and changing market dynamics since then raise questions as to how the sector will react. New online players and shifts in consumer awareness of retail banking options could affect how banks react to monetary tightening with regard to deposit pricing. Competition within the internet banking space, including companies such as Ally Financial, Discover Financial Services (DFS), Synchrony Financial, CIT Group and American Express, could be much stronger as those banks vie for deposits to support loan growth initiatives. Evidence of such increasing competition was apparent after the most recent Fed rate hike as DFS raised its online savings account rate to 1.1% from 1.0% while Goldman Sachs, which recently made its foray into consumer deposit gathering online increased its rate to 1.2% from 1.05%.

The 30-year-old psychologist from Boynton Beach, Florida dropped from paying 6.8 percent to 3.75 with lender SoFi, and also scored free trips to New York and Jamaica.  “When I got the email for refinancing directly from JetBlue, I figured they must be legit if a major airline is working with them,” said Friend.  SoFi and CommonBond, two startup private student loan refinancing companies, are getting increasingly aggressive with their signup bonuses to get new borrowers to refinance with them. Both companies offer cash referral programs – SoFi’s offer is $300 and Commonbond’s is $200. In addition, Credible.com, a student loan comparison site, offers between $250 and $1,000 per referral.  CommonBond and SoFi also both offer social programs, like happy hours and lectures, and career services. Unemployed borrowers who ask for help generally average three months to find a new job, said Phil DeGisi, a CommonBond spokesperson. CommonBond also has a social impact program where for every person who borrows a new student loan, one child’s education is paid for in Ghana.   JetBlue is SoFi’s first outside partner, but over the next 15 months, the company plans on adding new opportunities, said Catesby Perrin, SoFi’s partnership manager. “A lower payment isn’t enough anymore to encourage refinancing. Borrowers want to know the private lender cares about them,” said Perrin.  But no matter how low the interest rate is or services or bonuses, there are tradeoffs, said Thomas Harnisch, director of state relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. “These plans generally do not have a strong safety net like federal student loans for borrowers that cannot make their payments.”  It is important to first check eligibility for income-driven repayment plans and public service loan forgiveness, programs where remaining balances can be forgiven after 10 years of payments and work deemed by the U.S. Department of Education to be of public service, said Harnisch.  Going private also means giving up guaranteed breaks from repayment that came with your federal student loan when you have an economic shortfall. CommonBond offers up to 24 months of forbearance, while SoFi offers a program of up to 12 months when unemployed. The repayment break timeframes should be in each lender’s contract. Friend found refinancing through a private company well worth it. Cutting her interest rate in half means with the same payment, she will pay off her balance in 5 years rather than 10.

Thomas Hollande, the son of former French President Francois Hollande who was acting as a lawyer for Tati's employees, said the deal would save the bulk of jobs at Tati and keep the brand alive.  This offer will let around 85 percent of staff stay on, which is more than most could have hoped for,  Hollande told reporters. The full financial terms of the takeover were not disclosed. Family-controlled retailer Eram had said earlier this year that it had decided to sell its loss-making Agora Distribution unit, which owns the Tati brand amongst others. Tati, which is well-known in France for its bright pink logo, started in 1948 in Paris when Jules Ouaki, a Tunisian and a pioneer in the low-cost textile market, opened the first store on boulevard de Rochechouart in the Barbes immigrant district of northern Paris, just downhill from the Sacre Coeur. However, it had been racking up losses amid increasing competition from low-cost fashion retail giants such as H&M; (HMb.ST), Zara (ITX.MC) and Primark (ABF.L). Eram had already tried to sell it in 2015. Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Brian Love","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/france-fashion-tati-idUSL8N1JN2YT"},

The cause of the accident was still unclear, officials said. Use of the Penol-Guatape reservoir, a popular site for water-sports and tours, was restricted as the search continued. The boat, El Almirante, was carrying 170 passengers and three crew members, said Margarita Moncada, the head of disaster relief for Antioquia province. Authorities had so far tallied 134 people rescued, six dead and 15 or 16 missing, Moncada told reporters, adding that they hoped the number of people rescued would continue to rise. Authorities were also unsure if all the people reported to be on the boat had actually been on board, she added. Officials initially reported nine people dead and 28 missing, but Moncada said some survivors rescued by private boats were taken to different docks on the reservoir shore and so were not immediately accounted for. Videos posted on social media showed motorboats coming to the aid of passengers on the upper decks as the boat rocked from side to side. Survivors told local television they heard a loud noise before the boat began to sink. It is a long holiday weekend in the Andean country and the reservoir is a well-known destination for families. Officials were interviewing the captain and investigating allegations by some passengers that they did not have life-jackets, Vice Transport Minister Alejandro Maya told journalists at the scene. President Juan Manuel Santos visited rescue crews at the reservoir, about an hour's drive from the city of Medellin, on Sunday night.

Power and LMC Automotive said on Monday. LMC also cut its full-year 2017 forecast for new vehicle sales for the third consecutive month, to 17.1 million units from its previous forecast of 17.2 million. June U.S. new vehicle sales will be about 1.48 million units, a drop of 2 percent from 1.51 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said. The forecast was based on the first 15 selling days of the month. Automakers will release June U.S. sales results on July 3. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for the month will be 16.5 million vehicles, down nearly 2 percent from 16.8 million units in the same month in 2016. Retail sales to consumers, which do not include multiple fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were set to decline more than 1.3 percent in June. U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. But the market has begun to saturate thanks partly to a glut of nearly-new used vehicles, forcing automakers to hike incentives to entice consumers to buy. Fears of a downturn were heightened earlier this month when automakers posted their third consecutive month of declining sales. Annualized sales fell to 16.66 million cars and light trucks in May from 17.17 million vehicles a year earlier.   As the U.S. auto market enters the fourth month in a row of a sub-17 million unit selling rate, nerves are being tested,  Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC Automotive, said in a release.  It will be challenging in the second half of the year to keep pace with 2016 ... but a year still expected above 17 million units should not be considered a poor performance.  The consultancies said consumer discounts averaged $3,661 per vehicle, a record for the month.  But the average transaction price also hit a record for the month of $31,720. Discounts as a percentage of the manufacturer's recommended sale price remained at 10 percent in June, a level industry experts say is unsustainable. Inventory levels at major automakers have also raised concerns.  The average number of days a new vehicle sits on a dealer's lot before sale remained at 70 through the first 15 days of June.

The deal is the latest example of the move toward contracts for prescription drugs and medical devices that attempt to bring down soaring healthcare costs by tying reimbursements to whether the products achieve their intended results. The deal with Aetna will measure health outcomes for  patients who transition to one of three Medtronic pumps that self-adjust to keep blood sugar levels in proper range based on patients' individual needs for insulin.  This agreement reinforces our shift towards value-based healthcare,  Hooman Hakami, president of the Medtronic diabetes group, said in a statement.  We know technology alone isn't enough and ultimately improved outcomes are what matter.  Patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 who have progressed to the need for insulin typically check blood sugar levels several times a day and inject insulin as needed. The pumps eliminate that chore. Medtronic declined to discuss financial details of the Aetna agreement, but said such deals tie revenue to achievement of clinical improvement targets, as well as shared savings for delivering on or exceeding clinical outcomes and cost targets. Suzanne Winter, vice president of the Medtronic diabetes group in the Americas, said the Aetna agreement will initially focus on whether patients on its pumps achieve their A1c targets, a commonly used measure of blood sugar levels. The American Diabetes Association recommends A1c levels below 7. In the future it may look at other measures, such as hypoglycemia episodes, time in proper glycemic range, and patient satisfaction, Winter said. Medtronic already has an agreement with UnitedHealth Group Inc that is moving toward including patient outcomes and other metrics, such as total cost of care, and the company is discussing similar deals with other insurers, Winter said. Pharmaceutical companies are also beginning to embrace reimbursement options that take patient outcomes into consideration.

From music production with Def Jam to clothing with the Phat Farm label, to consumer finance with RushCard or even his yoga studio Tantris, Simmons keeps popping up everywhere. For the latest in Reuters'  Life Lessons  series, Simmons, the brother of  Run-D.M.C.'s Reverend Run, sat down to talk about how he went from a modest boyhood in New York City to becoming a master of all trades. Q: Your parents were park and school administrators in Queens, New York, so what did they teach you about making a dollar stretch? A: They taught me to be frugal. My mother and father were both artists really in their hearts. Money was never primary in any of our choices for education or in life. They were very supportive of my brothers and myself. They pushed us to take the route that inspired us, rather than the one that produced the most money. Q: As co-founder of Def Jam, what did you learn about turning a cultural movement into a successful business? A: It's about faith and resilience. It's about quieting the mind and being more present. When I made a good record, the world moved slowly. When I listened to the record, I'd be engaged and fully awake and present. That is what we want in life: to be more present. Q: By expanding into other business lines, like clothing with Phat Farm, what lessons about entrepreneurship did you absorb? A: I've learned you have to have faith in your businesses. Hard work, determination, faith and resilience are the nucleus of success. This takes time, and people quit. But I've learned you can't fail until you quit. People want to see results, but as it says in the scripture, 'You have control over your work alone and never its fruit.' I've always had faith that it was a better path to enjoy the work, than count the results of that work. Q: How do you decide where you can have the most impact? FILE PHOTO: Russell Simmons arrives as a guest to the premiere of the new film  Lee Daniels' The Butler  in Los Angeles, California August 12, 2013.Fred ProuserA: I co-founded RushCard, a prepaid debit card company, almost 15 years ago. I wanted to empower those families who had been cut out of the modern banking economy. We helped pioneer the space. Prepaid cards are now a valuable, convenient financial tool for working-class, middle-class and affluent families who want an alternative to a checking account. I'm also the chairman of the Foundation of Ethnic Understanding, fighting anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, even though I'm not a Jew or a Muslim. It's because no one else is doing it. This is why I started my yoga studio, Tantris. It's a practice, not just exercise. I wanted to teach yoga and deliver those ancient scriptures in a way that's not esoteric, and make sure I give a full experience to promote ideas and a state of happiness and presence. Q: With your own portfolio, do you tend to prefer a particular asset class - stocks, bonds, real estate? A: I don't invest in any of those. I invest in triple-A convertible bonds. I don't really invest in any companies I don't have control over or support in some way. I'm only an investor in my own businesses. Q: How would you define success? A: Stable, lasting happiness. We get there through operating from a comfortable seat and having a quiet mind - the state of needing nothing. It is a practice, and you get there by being more compassionate, more giving and less anxious. It's about being more present - the more present we are, the happier we are. Q: Does your interest in yoga and spirituality help inform your decision-making in other aspects of your life? A: Every aspect of my life should be informed by yoga. I promote to anyone wanting to do business to sit still and meditate for 20 minutes one or two times a day. This is the key to creativity and good choices. Q: What lessons about life and money do you try to pass down to your kids? A: Don't waste any of God's resources. Money is small, but the idea to not be wasteful is big. Not to waste is a much, much greater lesson overall. Having a frugal attitude is what I'd like them to take away.

The 30-year-old psychologist from Boynton Beach, Florida dropped from paying 6.8 percent to 3.75 with lender SoFi, and also scored free trips to New York and Jamaica.  “When I got the email for refinancing directly from JetBlue, I figured they must be legit if a major airline is working with them,” said Friend.  SoFi and CommonBond, two startup private student loan refinancing companies, are getting increasingly aggressive with their signup bonuses to get new borrowers to refinance with them. Both companies offer cash referral programs – SoFi’s offer is $300 and Commonbond’s is $200. In addition, Credible.com, a student loan comparison site, offers between $250 and $1,000 per referral.  CommonBond and SoFi also both offer social programs, like happy hours and lectures, and career services. Unemployed borrowers who ask for help generally average three months to find a new job, said Phil DeGisi, a CommonBond spokesperson. CommonBond also has a social impact program where for every person who borrows a new student loan, one child’s education is paid for in Ghana.   JetBlue is SoFi’s first outside partner, but over the next 15 months, the company plans on adding new opportunities, said Catesby Perrin, SoFi’s partnership manager. “A lower payment isn’t enough anymore to encourage refinancing. Borrowers want to know the private lender cares about them,” said Perrin.  But no matter how low the interest rate is or services or bonuses, there are tradeoffs, said Thomas Harnisch, director of state relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. “These plans generally do not have a strong safety net like federal student loans for borrowers that cannot make their payments.”  It is important to first check eligibility for income-driven repayment plans and public service loan forgiveness, programs where remaining balances can be forgiven after 10 years of payments and work deemed by the U.S. Department of Education to be of public service, said Harnisch.  Going private also means giving up guaranteed breaks from repayment that came with your federal student loan when you have an economic shortfall. CommonBond offers up to 24 months of forbearance, while SoFi offers a program of up to 12 months when unemployed. The repayment break timeframes should be in each lender’s contract. Friend found refinancing through a private company well worth it. Cutting her interest rate in half means with the same payment, she will pay off her balance in 5 years rather than 10.

Oil edged up for the third straight session but gains were capped by the relentless rise in U.S. supply and bloated global inventories. The recent drop in oil prices has spurred concerns about low inflation, which stubbornly remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target rate. The central bank raised rates this month for the second time this year and is expected to raise it again. Futures imply only a 50 percent chance of another rate hike by December. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is set to speak in London on Tuesday and investors will look for clues on the rate outlook, after other Fed officials shared mixed views in recent days. On Monday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said the Fed needs to raise rates gradually or the economy runs the risk of overheating. New York Fed chief William Dudley said recent narrowing of credit spreads, record stock prices and falling bond yields could encourage the Fed to continue tightening U.S. policy.  The Fed policymakers had been broadly hawkish last week, and most of them anticipate another rate hike in 2017 (most likely in December),  said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.  However, fixed-income markets are saying it's over for this year as they don't see inflationary pressures coming anytime soon. It's still too far from December, but oil prices will play a significant role on how interest rates go from here.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 0.3 percent.

Wall Street looked set to open higher, according to index futures  . The-pan-European STOXX 600 share index rose 0.8 percent, led higher by banks after the agreement under which Italy's largest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, will take on the remaining good assets of collapsed Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. Intesa shares rose 4.7 percent. The Italian government will pay it 5.2 billion euros and give it guarantees of up to a further 12 billion euros.  The announcement of definitive steps to resolve the two Veneto banks should be seen as a positive for Italian banks and the broader sector (albeit at a high cost),  said Jefferies analyst Benjie Creelan-Sandford. Investors have long viewed the Italian banking sector as a major cause of fragility within the euro zone. An index of Italian banks was up 2.7 percent and the broader Milan market rose 1.5 percent. Italian 10-year government bond yields fell 4 basis points to 1.88 percent, narrowing the gap over benchmark German equivalents to 164 bps.  Negative consequences for the Italian state will be offset by the positive consequences for Italian government bonds in terms of reducing the already high uncertainty surrounding this issue,  said BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche. Greece's 10-year yields fell to their lowest since 2009 after Moody's upgraded its credit rating on Friday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.6 percent as tech stocks led gains. Trading was slow with many markets in the region closed for holidays to celebrate the end of Ramadan. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.1 percent. Mainland Chinese shares rallied, with the CSI300 index rising 1.2 percent to its highest in almost 18 months, after MSCI said the index provider could raise its weighting of China's mainland-listed 'A' shares. The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.1185, with the dollar edging up 0.1 percent as the gap between short- and longer-dated U.S. government bond yields held close to recent 10-year lows hit on signs inflation is likely to remain subdued. Investors greeted the election last year of U.S. Donald Trump as likely to lift inflation, and with it U.S. interest rates. But price pressures have remained subdued. The Federal Reserve raised rates this month for the second time this year and has said it expects to raise again later this year. Futures imply only a 50 percent chance of a further hike by December. Central Bankers Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks on London in Tuesday and investors will be on alert for any clues to the rate outlook, after mixed views from other Fed officials in recent days.  The market continues to call the Fed's bluff on its intentions to change rates. I don't think anything (Fed chair) Janet Yellen can say this week will change that,  said Stephen Gallo, head of European FX strategy with Bank of Montreal. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi speaks on Monday, before a meeting of central bankers in Portugal later in the week. The yen fell 0.4 percent to 111.69 per dollar while sterling, on the up since more Bank of England policymakers have either called or said they are likely to call for higher interest rates, rose 0.3 percent to $1.2733. A major cause of lower inflation globally has been a fall in oil prices in recent weeks on signs an agreement by producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is failing to curb a global glut of crude. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 12 cents, giving back most early gains as the dollar firmed, to $45.66. Oil prices are down around 13 percent since late May. Dollar weakness also initially lifted copper. However, the industrial metal pulled back from an 11-week high as the greenback gained strength and stood at $5,802 a tonne, flat on the day. Gold fell to its lowest in almost six weeks. Dealers cited the stronger dollar and a large sell order.

Addressing a rally in Tanzania's coast region last week, President John Magufuli said female students who become mothers would  never  be allowed back in school - reaffirming a ban dating back to the 1960s.  As long as I am president ... no pregnant student will be allowed to return to school,  he said.  We cannot allow this immoral behavior to permeate our primary and secondary schools.  Denying pregnant girls and new mothers access to education is a violation of their rights, said Equality Now, an international charity defending girls' rights.   Pregnant girls, especially those who have been subject to sexual violence or exploitation must not be discriminated against,  Christa Stewart of Equality Now said in an email. The east African nation has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy and birth rates in the world and 21 percent of girls aged 15 to 19 have given birth, according to a 2015/16 survey conducted by the Tanzania Bureau of Statistics. More than 55,000 Tanzanian schoolgirls have been expelled from school over the last decade for being pregnant, the Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR) said in a report in 2013. Some wealthier families are able to send their daughters to private schools but the majority end up looking for casual work. On Twitter, the hashtag #StopMagufuli, promoted by Equality Now and other women's rights groups, has been trending for days. Irene Masawe, 21, who was kicked out of school in Dar es Salaam after falling pregnant three years ago, said the ban sigmatized pregnant girls and could push them into unsafe abortions.  Some girls with simple minds might be forced to have risky abortions to avoid shame - or even think about committing suicide,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. According to President Magufuli, teen mothers would set a bad example to other students if allowed back in school. But critics said the focus on punishing girls was counterproductive.  It's unfair to punish the girl alone, as that is tantamount to punishing the victim,  Tanzanian columnist Jenerali Ulimwengu wrote in The East African newspaper. While sex with underage girls is criminalized in Tanzania, parents may marry off their daughters using a special privilege granted by a 1971 marriage law, which allows a girl as young as 15 to marry with parental or the court's consent. Emily Nyoni was expelled from school in Dar es Salaam after getting pregnant in 2012, ending her dreams of becoming a doctor. She said the president's statement would victimize girls.  Some people will hate you because you are pregnant or have given birth, they will despise you as if you have committed an unforgivable sin,  she said.

The Grenfell Tower blaze, which trapped dozens of people in their beds, has become a focus of public anger at the Conservative government's austerity cuts and the perceived slow response in trying to look after those who escaped. The government said the number of high-rise tower blocks in England found to have  cladding  - panels placed on the facades of buildings, mainly for insulation or to improve their appearance - that have failed fire safety tests had risen to 75 from 60. Communities minister Sajid Javid said that all samples submitted had failed the tests, which May's spokesman had earlier said was  concerning .

Clearly it's concerning, concerning for residents who are living in these blocks,  the spokesman told reporters at a regular government briefing. Cladding is removed from the side of Whitebean Court in Salford, Manchester, Britain June 26, 2017.Andrew Yates That's why we have put in place a system where testing can be carried out very quickly and whereby local authorities are informed immediately when a positive test comes back and that appropriate measures are put in place,  he said. Responding to criticism that the testing program was not running quickly enough, he said landlords must get potentially flammable building materials tested as soon as possible. Slideshow (3 Images)Material should also be tested in schools and hospitals if there were safety concerns there too. Some 600 buildings are being tested, showing how widely combustible cladding may have been used across Britain.  It is clearly of huge concern that this is the case,  the spokesman said.  What is apparent is that this is on buildings across the country ... Obviously the job for the public inquiry will be to find out how and why this happened,  he said, hoping there would be an earlier interim report to cast some light on why such materials were used and whether they met safety requirements.     U.S. firm Arconic Inc said it was stopping global sales of its Reynobond PE cladding, which was used in Grenfell Tower, for use in high-rise buildings following the fire. Shares in Arconic fell around 5 percent. Reporting by Elizabeth Piper and Alistair Smout; editing by Mark Heinrich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-fire-concern-idUSL8N1JN25Y"},

The government will pay 5.2 billion euros to Intesa, and give it guarantees of up 12 billion euros, so that it will take over the remains of Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, which collapsed after years of mismanagement and poor lending. However, Bank of Italy officials said the final bill for the state would be small and some money could be recovered from the management and sale of the two banks' bad loans.  The state could even end up not losing a penny, and even if it did it would be for a limited amount,  Bank of Italy's Chief Supervisor Carmelo Barbagallo told a press briefing on Monday. He said that under the deal the state would take on 11.7 billion euros in assets to be liquidated, consisting of 10 billion euros in net soured debts and around 2 billion euros in financial assets. Confirming a Reuters report, Bank of Italy's Deputy Governor Fabio Panetta said at the same briefing that a group of investment funds had expressed an interest for the two banks in recent weeks but their offer was rejected by the EU Commission. Panetta said the solution found removed significant elements of  systemic tensions  for Italian banks.

My in-laws gave us two piglets, which brought us manure to farm a plot of leased land, crops we could sell at the market, and ultimately enough money to buy our own piece of land,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, keeping an eye on her constantly buzzing phone. Today she owns a dozen acres of land, where she has trained hundreds of students and farmers – among others – on organic farming practices as a means of adapting to Uganda's increasingly erratic climate. Although most farmers in Uganda own or rent a plot of land, however small, many lack the knowledge and skills to cope with increasingly extreme weather events like longer dry spells and erratic rainfall, agricultural experts in the area say.  In times of extreme weather many [farmers] carry on farming the same way they've always known, and see their yields decline as a result,  explained Deziderius Irumba, a learning coordinator at charity Care International.   If the rains don't come, for example, they just wait, and by the time the rains do come many of their crops will have already failed due to pests,  he said. Efforts to change that are underway, however, by training farmers - but also entrepreneurs, students and journalists - on climate change and efforts to adapt to it, and encouraging them to share that knowledge among their networks. Since 2015 the campaign has trained over 1,000 people in partnership with Uganda's Makerere University. The most promising have been elected 'climate champions' by their peers, and are then responsible for training others. The initiative, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, is called Uganda Education and Research to Improve Climate Change Adaptation Activity.  The idea is to show people that climate change affects every one of us, but also to explain how they can do something about it, so they hopefully become inspired to take action and become a go-to person in their area,  said Sarah Fortunate, a climate adaptation specialist who coordinates the project. Smart Farming Kiiza, who became a climate champion in 2015 and whose five children are also champions, showcases a range of farming practices at her farm. Those include building underground water tanks to harvest rainwater while limiting evaporation, and planting herbs in jerrycans tied to wood boards to maximize farming space.  I try to make the most of the resources I have, whether it's building a drip irrigator out of a plastic bottle or putting dirt in a used tire to grow vegetables,  she said, bending to examine a patch of spinach. Geoffrey Mabirizi, another farmer and champion from a nearby village, teaches his neighbors to do intercropping – growing two or more crops together so they have a crop to fall back on if one harvest fails. He said it doesn't matter whether those he trains are farmers or others who can help spread the news about new ideas.  Journalists or traders, for example can be just as influential as farmers by spreading the climate and farming advice they've received to their readers or clients,  he said. Although training sessions are open to people of all ages, the project has in particular set up week-long  bootcamps  for university students to help them learn about climate change and brainstorm ideas on how to adapt to it. Fortunate said students at a recent bootcamp decided to design teaching materials on climate change and smart farming for primary school students. Women at work on the farm of Geoffrey Mabirizi, who is adopting climate-smart farming techniques, in Masaka, Uganda, June 24, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Zoe TabaryShe hopes to get those educational aids approved by the government  so they are everywhere . Show, Don't Tell Key to the trainings, said Mabirizi, is teaching practice rather than theory.   In my first training I talked about carbon dioxide, about adaptation, and I completely lost them,  he admitted.  They would ask questions like 'How do you know this is carbon dioxide'? Even I started to get confused!  he laughed.  So I decided to go back to basics – that is, demonstrating smart farming practices to trainees rather than just telling them what to do.  Vegetables growing in jerrycans tied to wood boards are seen at climate champion Josephine Kiiza’s farm in Masaka, Uganda, June 23, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Zoe TabaryEven then, less than half go on to implement the techniques based just on the training, he said.  So if you can, the best thing is to go to their farm or home and show them what to do.   Efforts to work with farmers need to start with women, who are more financially vulnerable than men, Kiiza said.  Many women I met throughout the country, especially widows whose husbands had died of AIDS, could only afford to eat one meal per day and were severely malnourished,  she said. But women can be excellent messengers for the new ideas, she said.   When you talk to a woman, you effectively get access to her whole family, as women know everything that's going on,  she said.  So if you're trying to reach farmers, women can be a powerful communication tool.  Scaling Up Although many champions stay in touch with each other after meeting at in-person trainings, there is no formal platform yet for them all to do so, Fortunate said.  So we'd like to set up an online forum or a WhatsApp group where they can share experiences,  she said. Some champions are already doing this themselves. Mabirizi said he has  over 20 WhatsApp groups with farmers and trainees, where I try to take a few minutes every evening to answer questions . The next step for the project, said Fortunate, is to help 40 university students secure three-month internships with farmers who are also climate champions in their area.  That will grow our pool of trainers, but also make the students more employable,  she said. Reporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, editing by Laurie Goering.

Hedge funds and other money managers appear to have entered their own special version of hell and abandoned all hope that OPEC will rebalance the oil market, slashing formerly bullish bets on crude futures and options. Hedge fund managers cut their net long position in the three main futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 109 million barrels in the week to June 20 (tmsnrt.rs/2sI1qoh). Funds have cut their net long position by a total of 161 million barrels over the last three weeks, taking it down to just 389 million barrels, the lowest since Aug. 9, 2016 (tmsnrt.rs/2sIaTMH). Fund managers now hold just two long positions for every one short position, which ranks among the most bearish positions since oil prices started to tumble in the middle of 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/2tcPA76). Extreme bearishness extends to refined fuels, where hedge funds have a net short position of 27 million barrels in U.S. heating oil and a near-record net short position in U.S. gasoline of 21 million barrels. The hedge fund community placed enormous faith in OPEC’s ability to accelerate oil market rebalancing through cuts announced late in 2016 in association with key non-OPEC producers. Fund managers accumulated a record net long position of almost 1 billion barrels by the middle of February only to suffer a sharp reversal in prices starting early the next month. The accumulation of long positions for a second time in April was similarly rewarded with a brutal sell off in oil prices, leaving many fund managers struggling with large losses for the year. OPEC’s decision to leave production unchanged last month, rather than cut more deeply, has sparked a third sell off, and extinguished any remaining bullishness and emboldened short sellers. Hedge funds have embarked on a new cycle of short-selling in Brent and WTI, the eighth since the start of 2015, which has added to the downward pressure on prices. Fund managers have added 77 million barrels of extra short positions in WTI and 59 million barrels in Brent since June 6, according to data from regulators and exchanges. Hedge funds have added short positions faster and more aggressively than during any previous short-selling cycle in the last three years (tmsnrt.rs/2tcWJoa). Short positions across the three major Brent and WTI contracts are now running at the highest level since August 2016 and close to the record short position established in January 2016, just as oil prices reached their lowest point in this cycle. But the extreme pessimism across the entire petroleum complex is raising the risk of a reversal and future rise in prices (just as it did in January 2016). The concentration of short positioning in Brent and WTI is becoming a crowded trade and threatens to spark a rise in prices if and when fund managers try to lock in profits and cover some of those positions. The fundamental outlook appears weak, with U.S. shale drillers continuing to add extra rigs, despite the downturn in prices, but positioning data shows the risk of a short-covering rally is increasing.

The Datafolha poll asked voters about eight combinations of 12 potential candidates in a first-round vote. Lula, a member of the leftist Workers' Party, takes all scenarios where he runs, with around 30 percent of support, despite facing several corruption trials.  Slideshow (2 Images)Lula, who was Brazil's president from 2003 to 2010, and Silva, a former senator who came in third in the past two presidential elections, each polled at 40 percent in a runoff scenario. Lula was in a statistical tie with anti-corruption federal judge Sergio Moro, who has vowed never to enter politics. If Lula is found guilty of corruption by Moro, who is expected to issue a decision as soon as this month, and the ruling is upheld by an appeals court, he will be barred from running for public office. Silva easily wins all first-round vote scenarios in which Lula does not run. The poll showed 46 percent of voters would not vote for the former president, the highest rejection rate among all candidates considered in the survey.  Many analysts see voter anger over corruption opening the door for a candidate from outside Brazil's political establishment, along with the fact nearly all expected candidates are ensnared in a corruption investigation involving kickbacks from some of Brazil's biggest companies. That has reflected in increasing support for right wing, law-and-order congressman Jair Bolsonaro, who polled as high as 18 percent in some of the scenarios in the Datafolha poll. Still, he fails to win any potential runoffs. The most recent poll interviewed 2,771 people across Brazil from June 21-23. The margin of error was 2 percent.

Shares of the U.S. drug developer fell as much as 11 percent to $57.40 in early trading on Monday, but recouped some losses to be down about 3.7 percent. The drug, vadastuximab talirine, was being evaluated in the late-stage study, Cascade, to treat a form of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Seattle Genetics declined to disclose the number of deaths, but said they were not related to liver toxicity, based on available data. In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had imposed a clinical hold on several early stage studies testing vadastuximab talirine after six AML patients were identified with liver toxicity and four died. The hold was lifted in March. The discontinuation of Cascade is not related to the clinical hold from December, the company said in an email.  Seattle Genetics also said it would suspend patient enrollment and treatment in all trials involving vadastuximab talirine, including an early-stage study in patients with another form of blood cancer. The company, which is developing various cancer drugs, said it would consult the FDA regarding future plans for vadastuximab talirine. At least three analysts cut their revenue estimates for Seattle Genetics following the discontinuation of the trial. Oppenheimer analyst Leah Rush Cann slashed her estimated 2021 total revenue by 12.5 percent.  But some analysts turned their focus to the company's Adcetris drug ahead of a late-stage study readout expected by the end of the year.  Adcetris is already approved in the United States to treat patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have not realized enough benefits from prior therapies. The drug, which generated about $266 million in North America sales last year, is also being developed in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's immunotherapy, Opdivo, to treat relapsed hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The trial, involving previously untreated HL patients, could help expand the Adcetris label.

Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has been feuding bitterly with its Japanese partner over the sale of the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips and has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent. The tensions come amid uncertainty over whether Toshiba can sign as planned a definitive agreement with its preferred bidder - a group led by the Japanese government and including U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital - by Wednesday, the day of its annual shareholders meeting. The conglomerate is rushing to sell the unit to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit and to dig itself out of negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. The preferred bidder consortium's 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) offer calls for a state-backed fund, INCJ, to pay 300 billion yen for a majority stake in terms of voting rights while Bain will put up more but not hold a majority, sources have said - an unusual arrangement that satisfies the Japanese government's desire to keep the firm under domestic control. Bain will invest 850 billion yen, which will include some equity with voting rights as well as some preferred shares, while South Korea's SK Hynix will provide half the amount Bain plans to put up in the form of financing, the sources said. The Development Bank of Japan and the core unit of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group are also part of the consortium. Western Digital said in a June 25 letter to Toshiba's board that SK Hynix's participation in the consortium increased the likelihood of technology leakage to the rival chipmaker, adding that the winning bid did not appear to be bigger than its own offer.  I must make it clear that Western Digital will not consent to a transaction with the proposed consortium,  CEO Stephen Milligan said in a letter, which was seen by Reuters.  This potential course of action would make further litigation inevitable,  the letter said. The letter comes after Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa said on Friday it was open to talks with Western Digital, although it was not planning to make the first move.  Tsunakawa also argued that SK Hynix would not be holding any equity and would not be involved in management - an arrangement that was unlikely to raise regulatory red flags and would prevent leaks of key technology information. SK Hynix declined to comment on the matter on Monday. The chipmaker, which is relatively weak in NAND chip technology, has said previously that it had decided to join the consortium as it sees business opportunities. Representatives for Bain could not be reached for comment outside regular office hours. Concerns about SK Hynix's participation have also been  voiced by some members of Toshiba's board, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday, declining to be identified as discussions were confidential. Toshiba has previously sued its South Korean rival over the suspected theft of data related to flash memory technology - a claim that was settled by SK Hynix for $278 million in December 2014. Tsunakawa said on Friday he did not expect any changes to the make-up of the consortium before June 28, adding that Western Digital' s offer had not found favor on price and because the U.S. firm wanted to take control of the unit. Western Digital expects a U.S. court ruling on its request for an injunction on July 14.

Shares of the U.S. drug developer fell as much as 11 percent to $57.40 in early trading on Monday, but recouped some losses to be down about 3.7 percent. The drug, vadastuximab talirine, was being evaluated in the late-stage study, Cascade, to treat a form of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Seattle Genetics declined to disclose the number of deaths, but said they were not related to liver toxicity, based on available data. In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had imposed a clinical hold on several early stage studies testing vadastuximab talirine after six AML patients were identified with liver toxicity and four died. The hold was lifted in March. The discontinuation of Cascade is not related to the clinical hold from December, the company said in an email.  Seattle Genetics also said it would suspend patient enrollment and treatment in all trials involving vadastuximab talirine, including an early-stage study in patients with another form of blood cancer. The company, which is developing various cancer drugs, said it would consult the FDA regarding future plans for vadastuximab talirine. At least three analysts cut their revenue estimates for Seattle Genetics following the discontinuation of the trial. Oppenheimer analyst Leah Rush Cann slashed her estimated 2021 total revenue by 12.5 percent.  But some analysts turned their focus to the company's Adcetris drug ahead of a late-stage study readout expected by the end of the year.  Adcetris is already approved in the United States to treat patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have not realized enough benefits from prior therapies. The drug, which generated about $266 million in North America sales last year, is also being developed in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's immunotherapy, Opdivo, to treat relapsed hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The trial, involving previously untreated HL patients, could help expand the Adcetris label.

The study tested Adcetris in combination with a three-drug chemotherapy regimen, AVD, compared with standard of care, to treat advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1,334 patients who have had no prior treatments. Adcetris is already approved in the United States to treat patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, who have already received a stem cell transplant or two chemotherapy treatments. The drug is also approved to treat patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma that have gone through one chemotherapy treatment. The study, which tested the combination as an initial treatment, showed 82.1 percent lower risk of cancer progression in the combination therapy, compared with 77.2 percent in the control arm. The standard-of-care chemotherapy, ABVD, combines adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine. Doctors for long have been trying to get rid of bleomycin from the chemotherapy regimen to increase the long-term durable response rate and decrease toxicity, Seattle Genetics Chief Executive Clay Siegall told Reuters. Seattle Genetics, which partnered with Takeda to co-develop and commercialize Adcetris outside the United States, retains marketing rights for the drug in the United States and Canada. Adcetris, known chemically as brentuximab vedotin, links a tumor-targeting antibody to a cancer-killing chemotherapy drug with the goal of limiting side effects. It is designed to home in on an antigen, or a foreign substance, in Hodgkin's lymphoma and in several types of T-cell lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in white blood cells. It typically begins in the lymph nodes in one region of the body and then spreads throughout the lymph system. According to the American Cancer Society, about 8,260 Americans were diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma so far in 2017, out of which about 1,070 died. The U.S. drug developer said it would file for an expanded label as soon as possible. The drug, which generated about $266 million in North America sales last year, is also being developed in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's immunotherapy, Opdivo, to treat relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma.

That's not going to happen, well placed sources in Beijing and Hong Kong say, as Hong Kong marks the 20th anniversary of that handover. China did offer a contentious electoral reform package in 2014, which allowed Hong Kong a direct vote, but only of candidates pre-screened by Beijing. The city's pro-democracy lawmakers vetoed the package, which critics called  fake democracy . And so Hong Kong's next leader was again chosen this year by a small electoral college stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists.    There will be no second chance,  said a source in Beijing with ties to the Chinese leadership, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the matter.  We can't afford to do it all over again. It's too painful and a waste of time and resources.  A senior Hong Kong official said even if China changed its mind, Beijing wouldn't back down on its requirement that candidates be vetted, effectively shutting out pro-democracy contenders for the top job.  A (democratically-elected) chief executive who does not get along with the central (government) will be a disaster for Hong Kong,  said the source with ties to the Chinese leadership.  It would lead to gridlock ... Hong Kong people will suffer.  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of China's State Council did not respond to faxed questions. But Chinese authorities have long stated they respect Hong Kong's  high degree of autonomy  and are supportive of lawful and gradual democratic development until universal suffrage is realized. In comments reported by state media on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said  one country, two systems  remained the best way to ensure Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability and vowed to stand by it  unswervingly . Sown Distrust The battle for full democracy in Hong Kong has been a defining issue for the city of 7.3 million. It has sown distrust between China and Hong Kong, polarized politics, hampered governance and stoked mass street protests, including the 79-day pro-democracy Occupy movement of 2014 that tried but failed to wrest democratic concessions from Hong Kong and Chinese authorities. In the process, a young generation has become radicalized, with some agitating for greater autonomy and even independence from China. Authorities have tried to snuff that out. In March, Hong Kong police arrested nine activists including a few leaders of the Occupy movement. That came after two pro-independence, democratically elected legislators were kicked out of Hong Kong's assembly late last year.  Beijing's harder line on Hong Kong has been mirrored on the mainland with Xi's crackdown on dissent since coming to power five years ago.  Hong Kong's democratic experiment is seen as a litmus test of Beijing's tolerance for eventual political reforms in mainland China, where calls for greater civil liberties and grassroots democracy have been growing, experts say.

Colonial Hong Kong's governor was appointed and Britain did little to promote democracy until near the end of its rule. International Push The pro-democracy movement has lost considerable steam  following the crackdown on activists, as well as infighting between various democratic groups.  But the movement has recently stepped up its longstanding international engagement, particularly with Washington. Last month, Joshua Wong, a skinny, 20-year-old who helped lead the Occupy protests, and veteran democrat Martin Lee told the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China the  high degree of autonomy  promised to Hong Kong had eroded over two decades of Chinese rule. Slideshow (4 Images)U.S. Republican Senator Marco Rubio is pushing a  Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act , a bipartisan bill to punish Chinese officials who suppress basic freedoms in Hong Kong. The campaign by Wong, who was featured in a recent Netflix documentary, also took him to Taiwan in recent weeks, where 18 pro-independence lawmakers launched a new congressional caucus on Hong Kong, modeled in part on the U.S. initiative. He also traveled to Japan for a lobbying trip this month.  I'm really optimistic that in the future, we can take this as a reference and just get bipartisan support around the world,  said Wong, who is facing a possible five-year jail term on  unlawful assembly  charges. Protests Ahead of Xi Visit Just days before Xi visits for the 20th anniversary of the handover on July 1, Wong and around a dozen activists, all dressed in black, covered a statue of a golden Bauhinia flower considered a symbol of Chinese sovereignty, in black cloth to symbolize what they called the brutality of the Chinese regime.  One country, two systems a lie for 20 years,  Wong and his fellow activists shouted, pumping fists. Tens of thousands of others are expected to attend various protests when Xi is in town including a July 1 rally with the theme  retake Hong Kong for a democratic government .  It's time to let Hong Kong people have democracy and universal suffrage,  said Wong. Martin Lee, the 79-year-old barrister widely known as one of the fathers of the democratic movement in Hong Kong said Beijing is trying to  extinguish the fire of democracy that is burning in the hearts of young people .  But if I were to die today, Hong Kong would be fine with young leaders like that.

If coal is dying, how come there is an increasingly heated bidding war going on for Rio Tinto's coal mines in Australia? Here's another question, this time for the pro-coal lobby. If coal still has a viable long-term future as an energy source, how come the world's biggest planned new mine is now hostage to whether the Australian government decides to loan it money? Reconciling these two questions may seem like a challenge but both the battle for Rio Tinto's existing mines and the struggles of India's Adani to build its Carmichael project neatly show where coal currently finds itself. Rio's mines in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney are attractive to both Glencore and China's Yancoal because they are likely to be profitable for the remaining life of the pits, which is expected to be around 20 years. The Rio mines already have all the necessary infrastructure, being connected by rail to the major export harbor of Newcastle, the world's largest coal export port. They also have existing customers for the high quality thermal coal used to generate electricity, including utilities in Japan, which have preferred long-term supply agreements over the more volatile spot shipments that are more characteristic of deals to sell to major importers China and India. In some ways the Rio mines up for sale are insulated from the downturn in global coal demand expected over the next 30 years, because they supply fuel to customers who are likely to be among the last to switch off coal-fired generators, assuming renewables do eventually succeed in killing off the polluting fuel. Acquiring an existing asset is likely far more attractive to a company such as Glencore than developing new mines, with the associated capital costs and inevitable opposition from environmental groups. Glencore raised its offer for Rio's Hunter Valley mines to $2.675 billion in cash on June 23, making its bid some $225 million more than Yancoal's proposal. Rio said it would study the revised Glencore offer, having previously accepted the lower Yancoal bid on the grounds that it could be completed more quickly as it had regulatory approvals. Coal May Be Dying, but It's Going to Linger It may seem incongruous to environmentalists that there is a bidding war for something that has been declared a dying industry, but there is still a medium-term future for coal, and Glencore and Yancoal are trying to profit from that. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its medium-term coal market report in December that it still expects growth in coal demand up to 2021, albeit at a considerably slower rate. The rise in coal demand is likely to be driven by India and Southeast Asia, according to the IEA, with top consumer China actually using less by 2021 than in 2015. The IEA expects global coal demand to be 5.636 billion tonnes of coal equivalent in 2021, up from 5.4 billion in 2015, equating to an average annual growth rate of 0.6 percent, down from 2.5 percent over the decade to 2015. Like all forecasts, the IEA's estimates can be undone by changing circumstances, and it does appear to be the case that renewable energy sources like solar and wind are making faster than initially expected inroads, especially in India. It's this mounting uncertainty that is making it hard for Adani to get its planned 25-million tonne a year Carmichael mine in Queensland state to a stage where it can actually start construction. While the Indian conglomerate has taken what it termed a final investment decision on the $4 billion mine, it's also likely that it won't go ahead unless support from Australia's federal government is forthcoming. Specifically Adani wants close to $1 billion in loans from the government in order to build some 400 kms (240 miles) of new rail track to link the mine to the planned export port. Adani has already secured an undisclosed agreement with the Queensland state government that is believed to lower the burden of royalty payments, especially in the mine's early years of operation. Even if the federal government does lend the money, the Adani mine appears to be on somewhat shaky ground, given that its intended export market of India has a government with a stated policy goal of cutting coal imports to zero. While Australian governments have in the past assisted with infrastructure projects, the Adani mine was supposed to be proof that the private sector could pull off a major project with only supportive government regulation and not cash. There is still a good chance that the federal government will pony up the cash for Adani, given the ruling Liberal/National coalition has several pro-coal lawmakers and would like the credit from the jobs that will come with building the mine. But Carmichael may also be the last of its kind, given how prolonged and difficult its birth has been, with a well-funded environmental campaign against the mine and ongoing questions about its viability. It's hard to see any commercial bank being willing to fund a massively costly coal project in the future, given both the uncertainty over long-term demand and the negative publicity that is sure to be generated. But oddly enough, the travails of getting a new coal project off the ground probably makes the jostling over existing mines more likely, as companies seek to extract the last dollars available from coal's twilight.

The utility-scale solar industry, which accounts for more than half of U.S. installations, would be hit hardest if Washington adopts the hefty remedies sought by bankrupt solar panel maker Suniva. That is because large projects depend on being cost-competitive with natural gas-fired plants to spur buying, research firm GTM Research said in their analysis.  This is arguably one of the biggest downside risks to the future of U.S. solar,  GTM's associate director of U.S. solar, Cory Honeyman, said in an interview. In April, Suniva filed a rare Section 201 petition with the U.S. International Trade Commission nine days after seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In the petition, the company asked for new duties on imported solar products to combat a global glut of panels that has depressed prices and made it difficult for American producers to compete. FILE PHOTO: Solar installers from Baker Electric place solar panels on the roof of a residential home in Scripps Ranch, San Diego, California, U.S. on October 14, 2016.Mike Blake/File PhotoSuniva was founded in Georgia but as of 2015 is majority owned by Hong Kong-based Shunfeng International Clean Energy. It was joined in the petition by another domestic manufacturer, the U.S. division of Germany's SolarWorld. The German company filed for insolvency last month. Suniva is seeking a duty rate of 40 cents per watt on solar cells and a minimum price on modules of 78 cents a watt for the first year, levels unseen since 2012, according to GTM. Between 2018 and 2022, U.S. solar installations would fall from 72.5 gigawatts to 36.4 GW with a minimum module price of 78 cents a watt, GTM said. If a 40 cent cell tariff were implemented as well, installations would drop to 25 GW during the period. The U.S. ITC will decide by September whether imports are causing harm to domestic producers. If it does find serious injury to the industry, by November the commission will recommend remedies to President Trump, who then makes a final decision. Trump could accept the ITC's recommendation or do something else entirely. The final outcome could vary greatly from Suniva's suggested remedies. The Solar Energy Industries Trade Association, the U.S. solar trade group, is opposed to Suniva's petition. The group said last week that an estimated 88,000 jobs would be lost if the trade protections Suniva is seeking are imposed.

Refugee claims are taking longer to be completed than at any time in the past five years, according to previously unpublished Immigration and Refugee Board data provided to Reuters. Those wait times are set to grow longer after the IRB in April allocated “up to half” of its 127 tribunal members to focus on old cases. The number of delayed hearings more than doubled from 2015 to 2016 and is on track to increase again this year. Hearings are crucial to establishing a claimant’s legal status in Canada. Without that status, they struggle to convince employers to hire them or landlords to rent to them. Claimants cannot access loans or student financial aid, or update academic or professional credentials to meet Canadian standards.  Canada's refugee system was struggling to process thousands of applications even before 3,500 asylum seekers began crossing the U.S. border on foot in January. It lacks the manpower to complete security screenings for claimants and hear cases in a timely manner. Often there are not enough tribunal members to decide cases or interpreters to attend hearings, the IRB said.  More than 4,500 hearings scheduled in the first four months of 2017 were canceled, according to the IRB data. The government is now focused on clearing a backlog of about 24,000 claimants, including people who filed claims in 2012 or earlier. That means more than 15,000 people who have filed claims so far this year, including the new arrivals from the United States, will have to wait even longer for their cases to be heard.  ​Asylum cases are already taking longer to finalize, on average, than at any time since Canada introduced a statutory two-month time limit in 2012. This year, it has been taking 5.6 months on average, compared to ​3.6 months in 2013. Mohamed Daud, 36, left his family and a pending refugee claim in the United States and walked into Canada in February after hearing rumors of U.S. immigration raids. Daud, originally from Somalia, had been living and working legally in Nebraska but feared he would be detained and then deported at an upcoming check-in with immigration officials.  His May 8 hearing with a Canadian refugee tribunal was canceled three days beforehand. He has not been given a new date.  I don’t know when they will call me. I can’t work. It isn’t easy,  said Daud. While waiting for a work permit, he gets approximately C$600 ($453) a month in government social assistance and shares a room in an apartment with six other asylum seekers. Still, Daud doesn't regret abandoning his life in the United States.

To try to speed cases through, Canada’s refugee tribunal  has put people from certain war-torn countries such as Syria and Yemen on an expedited track that requires no hearings.  ​Border agents are working overtime to address the backlog in security screenings, said Scott Bardsley, spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who oversees the Canada Border Services Agency.​ Slideshow (12 Images)Indefinite Wait Asylum claimants are eligible for work permits while awaiting hearings, but employers are often reluctant to employ people with temporary social insurance numbers whose future is uncertain, refugee lawyers told Reuters.  How do you establish yourself when your status is unknown?  said Toronto-based lawyer Aadil Mangalji. This year is on track to be the highest year for refugee claims since at least 2011, according to government statistics. The stresses on the Canadian system mirror those of other countries with an open door policy. In Sweden, rising financial strains involved in resettlement ​were partly behind a move to introduce tough asylum laws. Honduran Raul Contreras, 19, who walked across the Quebec border in March and whose hearing has been postponed indefinitely, is staying in a government-subsidized Toronto hotel with his mother, step-father and uncle. Contreras, who spends his days at a local library or working out in the hotel gym, says he has been repeatedly rejected by landlords.  They just said that they didn't rent places to refugee claimants,  he said.  (They) said that refugees don't have jobs and probably wouldn't pay.

Barry Cadden, the co-founder and former president of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center, was convicted in March of those crimes by a federal jury in Boston but cleared of the harshest charges he faced, second-degree murder. Prosecutors are seeking at least 35 years in prison for Cadden, whose conduct they said led to 778 patients nationwide being harmed after receiving contaminated steroids injections. That includes 76 people who died, they said. His lawyers counter that prosecutors are seeking to demonize Cadden, who they said was not convicted of knowing the drugs were contaminated, just of misrepresenting how they were made. They say Cadden, 50, deserves around only three years in prison.

Monetary policymakers need to take the evolution of financial conditions into consideration,  New York Fed President William Dudley, a permanent voter on U.S. interest rates and a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said on a closed-to-the-press panel on Sunday.   When financial conditions ease, as has been the case recently, this can provide additional impetus for the decision to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation,  he said according to prepared remarks published by the New York Fed. The Fed has raised rates three times since December and aims to begin shedding some of its $4.5 trillion in bond holdings later this year. Yet financial markets have not tightened as much as some expected, with equity indexes regularly logging new records and the 10-year Treasury bond rate declining since March. Dudley has repeatedly warned that the Fed would raise rates more aggressively if financial conditions did not tighten as desired, and vice versa.  Turning to the Fed's plan to shed bonds, Dudley noted that Treasury and mortgage-backed bond markets have reacted little.  To me, this suggests that these communications have generally been effective in fostering an orderly adjustment in expectations about how we are likely to normalize our balance sheet,  he said on the panel in Basel.

Refugee claims are taking longer to be completed than at any time in the past five years, according to previously unpublished Immigration and Refugee Board data provided to Reuters. Those wait times are set to grow longer after the IRB in April allocated “up to half” of its 127 tribunal members to focus on old cases. The number of delayed hearings more than doubled from 2015 to 2016 and is on track to increase again this year. Hearings are crucial to establishing a claimant’s legal status in Canada. Without that status, they struggle to convince employers to hire them or landlords to rent to them. Claimants cannot access loans or student financial aid, or update academic or professional credentials to meet Canadian standards. Canada's refugee system was struggling to process thousands of applications even before 3,500 asylum seekers began crossing the U.S. border on foot in January. It lacks the manpower to complete security screenings for claimants and hear cases in a timely manner. Often there are not enough tribunal members to decide cases or interpreters to attend hearings, the IRB said. More than 4,500 hearings scheduled in the first four months of 2017 were cancelled, according to the IRB data. The government is now focused on clearing a backlog of about 24,000 claimants, including people who filed claims in 2012 or earlier. That means more than 15,000 people who have filed claims so far this year, including the new arrivals from the United States, will have to wait even longer for their cases to be heard. ​Asylum cases are already taking longer to finalize, on average, than at any time since Canada introduced a statutory two-month time limit in 2012. This year, it has been taking 5.6 months on average, compared to ​3.6 months in 2013. Mohamed Daud, 36, left his family and a pending refugee claim in the United States and walked into Canada in February after hearing rumors of U.S. immigration raids. Daud, originally from Somalia, had been living and working legally in Nebraska but feared he would be detained and then deported at an upcoming check-in with immigration officials. His May 8 hearing with a Canadian refugee tribunal was cancelled three days beforehand. He has not been given a new date.  I don’t know when they will call me. I can’t work. It isn’t easy,  said Daud. While waiting for a work permit, he gets approximately C$600 ($453) a month in government social assistance and shares a room in an apartment with six other asylum seekers. Still, Daud doesn't regret abandoning his life in the United States.  The worry, the fear is the same,  he said. To try to speed cases through, Canada’s refugee tribunal has put people from certain war-torn countries such as Syria and Yemen on an expedited track that requires no hearings. ​    Border agents are working overtime to address the backlog in security screenings, said Scott Bardsley, spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who oversees the Canada Border Services Agency.​ Indefinite Wait Asylum claimants are eligible for work permits while awaiting hearings, but employers are often reluctant to employ people with temporary social insurance numbers whose future is uncertain, refugee lawyers told Reuters.  How do you establish yourself when your status is unknown?  said Toronto-based lawyer Aadil Mangalji. This year is on track to be the highest year for refugee claims since at least 2011, according to government statistics. The stresses on the Canadian system mirror those of other countries with an open door policy. In Sweden, rising financial strains involved in resettlement ​were partly behind a move to introduce tough asylum laws. Honduran Raul Contreras, 19, who walked across the Quebec border in March and whose hearing has been postponed indefinitely, is staying in a government-subsidized Toronto hotel with his mother, step-father and uncle. Contreras, who spends his days at a local library or working out in the hotel gym, says he has been repeatedly rejected by landlords.  They just said that they didn't rent places to refugee claimants,  he said.  (They) said that refugees don't have jobs and probably wouldn't pay.

A company spokesman also said the company needed to wrap up an appeals process for around 1,500 miners who face possible dismissal for taking part in a violent wildcat strike that started almost three weeks ago in protest against a company drive to root out illegal miners. Illegal gold mining has plagued South Africa for decades, with bullion pilfered from both disused and operating mines, and Sibanye has vowed it will clear all illegal miners from its shafts by January 2018.  We hope to have the appeals process done by the middle of the week and then we can resume production later this week,  company spokesman James Wellsted said. Workers at the mine downed tools over resentment at the company crackdown against illegal miners, which has included the arrest of employees for collusion and a ban on taking food underground. Underscoring the scale of the problem, 461 illegal miners have been arrested at Cooke since the stoppage began. They have been forced to come to the surface because of the strike, which has emptied the shafts of employees, thereby starving them of their sources of food and water underground - an unintended consequence of the strike.  Located about 60 kms (35 miles) south-west of Johannesburg, the Cooke mine produces about 181,700 ounces of gold a year and brings in around 377 million rand ($29 million) in operating profit, or just over 6 percent of the group's total.

Trump,Kiyo Matsumoto,Lil Wayne,Martin Shkreli,Seth Rich,Wu,Tang Clan,USA,CRIME/SHKRELI,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical entrepreneur vilified as the  pharma bro  for raising the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 percent, will go on trial on Monday for what U.S. prosecutors called a Ponzi-like scheme at his former hedge fund and a drug company he once ran. Prosecutors have accused Shkreli of lying to investors in the hedge fund and siphoning millions of dollars in assets from biopharmaceutical company Retrophin Inc to repay them. He has pleaded not guilty. The trial, which will be heard by U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn, is expected to last four to six weeks. Shkreli, a boyish-looking 34, outraged patients and U.S. lawmakers by raising the price of anti-parisitic drug Daraprim to $750 a pill, from $13.50, in 2015, when he was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals. The charges that led to his arrest in December 2015 are not related to Turing but focus on Shkreli's management at Retrophin and the hedge fund MSMB Capital Management between 2009 and 2012. Prosecutors said Shkreli lied about MSMB's finances to lure investors and concealed devastating trading losses from them. They said he paid the investors back with money stolen from Retrophin, which he founded in 2011. The criminal case has drawn attention in part because of Shkreli's refusal to lay low. He has continued to court the public eye, especially through social media, sometimes complicating his defense. At a hearing last Monday, prosecutors refused to agree to Shkreli's request to reduce his bail by $3 million, which he said he needs to pay taxes and legal bills, pointing to his own public boasts about his wealth. Since his arrest, Shkreli has flaunted purchases including a World War II-era Enigma code breaking machine, a Picasso painting and unreleased albums by Wu-Tang Clan and Lil Wayne. In April, he offered $40,000 to a Princeton University student who solved a mathematical proof. In May, he pledged on Facebook to pay $100,000 for tips leading to the arrest of the person who killed former Democratic National Committee employee Seth Rich. Shkreli was banned from Twitter in January for harassing a female journalist who wrote an op-ed piece for Teen Vogue criticizing President Donald Trump, whom Shkreli has supported. Shkreli's attention-seeking has at times exasperated his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, who urged Matsumoto last week not to give much weight to his client's  preposterous statements.

Djokovic, who split with his coaching team in a bid to resdiscover his form earlier this year, announced that he would start working with Agassi shortly before the French Open. The 47-year-old American, however, only stayed in Paris for the opening week, and it is not clear whether he will be in Djokovic's corner at next month's Wimbledon.  It looks great on paper when you bring in Andre Agassi, and it is great for tennis,  McEnroe told the British media.   He did have this career renaissance so there are reasons why it makes sense, but it is hard to think that it could make sense so fast.  I can't see it lasting if he is only coming around for very brief moments. But if they got a window of a month, obviously it is a totally different situation entirely.  Djokovic, who has struggled this year and suffered a quarter-final exit at the French Open, fell out of the top two spots in the world rankings this month for the first time since March 2011. He continues to work with a spiritual adviser, Pepe Imaz, a Spanish former player. But McEnroe believes that could be draining Djokovic of his killer instinct.  From an emotional standpoint, Djokovic perhaps felt he wanted to bring in somebody who wants to give people a lot of hugs,  McEnroe added.   That does not necessarily translate to killer instinct. It does not automatically lose it. But you don't want to get into a situation where it is all peace and love, and then you have to go out and stomp on somebody's head in competition.  In a bid to rediscover his form, Djokovic has taken a wildcard into this week's Aegon International at Eastbourne, his first grasscourt warm-up tournament appearance ahead of Wimbledon since 2010. The Serb as the tournament's top seed received a first-round bye and will face Czech Jiri Vesely or Vasek Pospisil of Canada in the second round.

The European Commission hit Intel with the record penalty seven years ago, accusing it of trying to stifle rival Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to PC makers Dell , Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from Intel. The U.S. chipmaker subsequently challenged the decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second highest. Judges rejected its arguments in 2014, saying the Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel's 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent. The company then appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ).  I expect a judgment sometime next year,  Marc van der Woude, vice-president at the General Court, told a competition conference organised by Concurrence.

The Japanese group has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Japan, citing more than $10 billion of liabilities related to lethal airbags. This is a big opportunity for smaller rival Key Safety Systems, a Chinese-owned American brand which agreed in principle to buy most of the business for $1.6 billion. There was no way the Japanese parts supplier could afford the industry’s biggest-ever recall. So while some proceeds will go into an $850 million restitution fund, as agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice, that will hardly cover the total costs incurred by its customers, including Honda, Toyota and others. Still, the outcome should minimise disruption for the manufacturers. A residual business will keep supplying replacement airbag inflators before being wound down. Everything else Takata sold can now be bought from KSS. And partnering with KSS, rather than a big competitor like Autoliv, means carmakers retain more choice in suppliers. This is a blot on corporate Japan to rival the stain from Toshiba, which is being demoted from the first section of the bourse and frantically selling its best business. Huge cost overruns in its U.S. nuclear subsidiary showed up Toshiba’s project-management failings; Takata’s failure has dented Japan’s reputation for technical excellence. In both cases, weak governance allowed problems to fester. Investors look foolish too. As recently as January, Takata’s market value exceeded $750 million despite looming liabilities. This is a huge boost for KSS. It implies a dramatic increase in scale – the firm was bought by Ningbo Joyson for just $920 million last year. That a Chinese-owned entity would gain a foothold in Japan’s vaunted auto industry thanks to poor quality control was once hard to imagine. But crisis can spark change. It helps that KSS is American and run independently, and Takata has few friends left among carmakers. The price looks reasonable. Suppose KSS only salvages half the revenues Takata made last year, as customers go elsewhere. At an 8 percent margin that would yield 26.5 billion yen of EBITDA, a Breakingviews calculation suggests. That implies a price of 6.6 times EBITDA, while Autoliv trades on 7.5 times forward EBITDA. Still, no one can blame KSS for wanting to drive safely. The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Hartford is the latest U.S. firm to transfer its pension obligations as rising interest rates and all-time high stock-market values give companies the perfect excuse to offload them. On Friday, Accenture Plc said it would transfer $1.6 billion in pension obligations to insurers American International Group Inc and MassMutual.

The figure is the second highest annual total ever recorded, LIMRA said. Hartford said on Monday it would transfer pension benefits of about 16,000 former employees. The company said it expected to recognize an after-tax pension settlement charge of about $485 million in the second quarter ending June 30.

A third day running of higher oil prices had investors buying a number of major currencies including the dollar against the yen in morning trade in Europe  in the hope that crude will hold inflation down less. Sterling recovered more ground as Prime Minister Theresa May sealed the support she needs to win a vote this week on her minority government's programme, helped by a shift by some at the Bank of England towards raising interest rates. But markets so far are loathe to buy the Fed's own line that it will raise U.S. rates once more before the end of 2017 and another three times next year. Even with a blip higher in morning trade, 5- and 10-year Treasury yields are up to 45 basis points below highs hit in March. The dollar traded 0.15 percent stronger at $1.1176 per euro and a third of a percent higher at 111.72 yen by 1115 GMT.  Market expectations are for a lot less (on rates) than what the Fed say they are going to deliver ... so oil's forming a base this morning has supported Treasury yields and the dollar,  said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.  (But) for any rise in U.S. yields and the dollar to be sustained we are likely to have to see a more convincing pickup in U.S. economic data.  Fed chair Janet Yellen makes a hotly awaited speech in Europe on Tuesday but most analysts were skeptical of the chances of her driving the greenback sharply higher.  The market continues to call the Fed's bluff on its intentions to change rates. I don't think anything Yellen can say this week will change that,  said Stephen Gallo, head of European FX strategy with Bank of Montreal.  We were saying buy dips in cable and euro (against the dollar) last week. We still look for the same this week.  Yellen is preceded by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Monday, watched for signs he is ready to let the ECB move more forcibly towards a reduction in emergency stimulus for the economy this year that should support the euro. Some say steadier oil prices would help Draghi sign up behind the move towards normalising policy being advocated by Germany's Bundesbank, but so far he has been reticent, worried that, not for the first time since 2008, the euro zone's recent pickup may prove less durable than hoped.

Trump,Kellyanne Conway,Neil Gorsuch,USA,COURT/RULINGS (UPDATE 1,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Adds that Justice Kennedy might be considering resigning) By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is set to issue the final rulings of its current term on Monday, including one on religious rights, amid talk that swing voter Justice Anthony Kennedy is considering retirement. The court in the coming days is also expected to act on President Donald Trump's emergency request seeking to revive his travel ban on people entering the United States from six Muslim-majority countries, which was blocked by lower courts. Although there are no firm indications that Kennedy, 81 in July, will step down, some of his former law clerks have said he is considering it. Any announcement could come after the court has finished issuing its rulings on Monday morning. Kennedy has repeatedly declined to respond to media requests seeking comment on his plans. He joined his former law clerks at a reunion event on Saturday night, with several attendees saying he did not address the rumors. If Kennedy were to retire, President Donald Trump, a Republican, would have a historic opportunity to recast the court in a more conservative posture, possibly for decades to come. He has already appointed one conservative justice, Neil Gorsuch. But Gorsuch replaced a conservative in a similar mold, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Replacing Kennedy, the swing vote for the last decade on the closely divided court, would be more significant. Kennedy has sided with the court's four liberals on some major issues, most notably gay rights. Speaking on ABC's  This Week  program on Sunday, Kellyanne Conway, a Trump adviser, declined to say if there has been any communication between the White House and Kennedy. The nine justices are due to rule in six cases, not including their decision expected in the coming days on the travel ban. Of the remaining cases argued during the court's current term, which began in October, the most eagerly awaited one concerns a Missouri church backed by a conservative Christian legal group. The ruling potentially could narrow the separation of church and state. The church sued after being denied state taxpayer funds for a playground improvement project because of a Missouri constitutional provision barring state funding for religious entities. Trinity Lutheran could be headed for a lopsided win, with two liberal justices joining their conservative colleagues in signaling support during the April oral argument. It was one of the first in which Trump's conservative appointee to the court, Neil Gorsuch, participated. The most notable of three immigration-related cases in which rulings are due on Monday is a dispute over whether immigrants detained by the U.S. government for more than six months while deportation proceedings unfold should be able to request their release. The case takes on additional significance with Trump ratcheting up immigration enforcement, placing more people in detention awaiting deportation. The court also is set to decide a case that could clarify the criminal acts for which legal immigrants may be deported. Another involves whether the family of a Mexican teenager shot dead while standing on Mexican soil by a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Texas can sue for civil rights violations. As the justices look to finish work before their summer break, they must decide what to do with Trump's travel ban, which was blocked by lower courts. The administration wants the ban to go into effect while the litigation continues. The March 6 executive order called for a 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the United States to let the government implement stronger vetting. Trump has said the order is needed for national security. (Additional reporting by Andrew Chung)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-rulings-idUSL1N1JN08A"},

Monetary policymakers need to take the evolution of financial conditions into consideration,  New York Fed President William Dudley, a permanent voter on U.S. interest rates and a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said on a closed-to-the-press panel on Sunday.   When financial conditions ease, as has been the case recently, this can provide additional impetus for the decision to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation,  he said according to prepared remarks published by the New York Fed. The Fed has raised rates three times since December and aims to begin shedding some of its $4.5 trillion in bond holdings later this year. Yet financial markets have not tightened as much as some expected, with equity indexes regularly logging new records and the 10-year Treasury bond rate declining since March. Dudley has repeatedly warned that the Fed would raise rates more aggressively if financial conditions did not tighten as desired, and vice versa.  Turning to the Fed's plan to shed bonds, Dudley noted that Treasury and mortgage-backed bond markets have reacted little.  To me, this suggests that these communications have generally been effective in fostering an orderly adjustment in expectations about how we are likely to normalize our balance sheet,  he said on the panel in Basel.

At issue is a law banning widely used neonicotinoids after research pointed to risks that they could harm bees, which play a crucial role pollinating crops. The full ban goes beyond EU restrictions that only apply to a few neonicotinoid chemicals, produced by companies including Bayer CropScience and Syngenta.  The government has decided not to reverse the provisions of the 2016 law,  Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a statement, adding that the question had been discussed but the ban was reconfirmed on June 21. Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert had earlier told RMC radio and BFM TV that he was in favour of softening the ban.  I want to address ... the possibility of a number of exemptions until we find substitution products,  Travert said. Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot replied on Twitter and in comments to journalists, saying there was no question of going back on the ban.  Whenever health is at stake, I will not make any concession,  he told reporters. Crop chemical makers say the research blaming neonicotinoid pesticides is not backed up by field evidence and a global plunge in bee numbers in recent years is a complex phenomenon due to multiple factors. Farmers' groups, meanwhile, say they need the pesticides to grow their crops, that no viable alternatives exist and that a full ban would put France at a disadvantage to other crop producers in the EU. The French law does envisage certain exemptions before the ban becomes a blanket prohibition from 2020.

The oil industry faces a bottleneck holding back resurgent domestic oil production - an outmoded U.S. distribution system. Pipeline construction often lags production booms by years - if proposed lines are built at all - because of opposition from environmentalists and landowners, topographic obstacles, and permitting and construction challenges. That forces drillers to limit output or ship oil domestically, usually by rail - which is more costly and arguably less safe.

Trump,Gillian Christensen,Mark Goldsmith,USA,IMMIGRATION/IRAQIS (UPDATE 1),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union asked a U.S. judge on Saturday to expand an order that temporarily blocks the deportation of 114 Iraqis in Michigan, to cover Iraqis nationwide, according to a court filing. The advocacy group filed an amended complaint seeking to keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting Iraqis from anywhere in the United States while a federal judge weighs the case of the Iraqis in Michigan. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith on Thursday ordered a stay in the Michigan Iraqis' deportation for at least two weeks while he decides whether he has jurisdiction. The ACLU, which had sued to block the Michigan deportations, asked Goldsmith to rule by Monday on expanding his order to cover the more than 1,400 Iraqis facing expulsion across the United States. The immigration agency has indicated it might start those deportations as soon as Tuesday, the ACLU said. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said the agency was reviewing the judge's order.  The agency intends to comply with the terms of the order, while determining the appropriate next steps,  she said in an email. The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. The ACLU said in its filing that those being deported could face persecution or torture because many were Chaldean Catholics or Iraqi Kurds and that both groups were recognized as targets of ill-treatment in Iraq. The ACLU also filed a motion asking the judge to extend his order nationwide to ensure that people who could face persecution, torture or death in Iraq are not deported. The arrests of the Iraqis in Michigan were part of a sweep by immigration authorities who detained about 199 Iraqi immigrants around the country. They had final deportation orders and convictions for serious crimes. The roundup followed Iraq's agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from President Donald Trump's revised temporary travel ban. The U.S. government has argued that the district court does not have jurisdiction over the case since only immigration courts can decide deportation issues.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-iraqis-idUSL1N1JN089"},

The market had broadly expected terms for the LME to emerge in June. Designed to generate at least €500m of capital, it is a crucial part of the package agreed with private equity firm Lone Star, which has agreed to buy a 75% stake in the  good bank  carved out of failed Banco Espirito Santo. Recent media reports said the LME terms have been set and are pending approval by regulators. However, a consortium of bondholders threw a potential spanner in the works in late May, offering to buy the bank themselves.  I wouldn't underestimate what the bondholders could do to make this situation significantly more complicated,  a market source told IFR. The LME was never going to be straightforward. Billed as voluntary, the issuer must entice bondholders to sign up to an exercise that will impose sufficient losses on them to raise the requisite capital. The source reckoned 50%-60% of the bonds are in the hands of sophisticated investors, with the remainder held by retail.  I think it's going to be very difficult to generate €500m of new capital with the current position of the bondholders,  he said.  It's going to be difficult for anyone to agree the execution of an LME with only the participation of retail.  The delay in the LME's implementation saw Moody's last Monday extend the review for downgrade on Novo Banco's Caa1 long-term deposit and Caa2 senior debt ratings.  If the LME fails to succeed, there is an increased risk of a resolution or liquidation for the bank with consequent losses for creditors,  the ratings agency said. Too Late? Details of the bondholders' offer have not been made public, but the source reckoned the terms could represent a better outcome for Novo Banco.  The bondholders' proposals to own the bank is phenomenally interesting,  he said.  It capitalises the bank in a much stronger way and becomes politically almost like a privatisation. I'm sure there are people moving into the camp of no LME. It's a really interesting chess game, and one that could set precedent for decision making and for future resolutions across Europe.  An investor, however, pointed out that Lone Star may be able to commit more capital down the line if needed. And though the August deadline is fast approaching, there is still time to attempt the LME.  The issue we have seen with Co-op Bank is that it's maybe better to have only one shareholder with deep pockets and tight management control, compared to a group of distressed bond investors who become part of an equity consortium and don't really put pressure on management in implementing reforms,  the investor told IFR. The Co-operative Group handed control of its banking arm to creditors in 2013 in order to seal a £1.5bn rescue, but has since struggled to return to health. The lender said on Monday that it was close to agreeing a financial rescue package with leading investors that would shore up its capital base. The European Central Bank declined to comment on developments at Novo Banco. Lone Star and the Resolution Fund did not respond to requests for comment.

A decade-long study, the first global review since 2005 and based on work by 300 experts, said the rate of discards was still high despite a decline from a peak in the late 1980s. Discarded fish are usually dead or dying. Almost 10 million tonnes of about 100 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the past decade were thrown back into the sea, according to the  Sea Around Us  review by the University of British Columbia and the University of Western Australia. Industrial fleets often throw back fish that are damaged, diseased, too small or of an unwanted species. A trawler with a quota only to catch North Atlantic cod, for instance, may throw back hake caught in the same net. Discards are an  enormous waste ... especially at a time when wild capture fisheries are under global strain amidst growing demands for food security and human nutritional health,  they wrote in the journal Fish & Fisheries. The report welcomed the decline in discards from a peak of about 19 million tonnes in 1989, roughly 15 percent of a total catch of 130 million tonnes. The fall may be linked to restrictions in some nations on discards and improved fishing gear. Also, a rise in the price of fishmeal for aquaculture made it profitable to keep formerly low-value species, it said. But it might just reflect a lack of fish.  We suspect that (the decline) is because overfishing ... has already depleted the species being discarded,  lead author Dirk Zeller of the University of Western Australia told Reuters. Few fish survive getting thrown back although some species such as sharks, rays or crustaceans are more resilient. The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization last estimated, in 2005, that eight percent of fish were discarded from 1992-2001. Those numbers, using different methods, are not directly comparable with the Sea Around Us data. The scientists said discards were now highest in the Pacific, a shift from the Atlantic. Russian fleets, for instance, discarded large amounts of Alaska pollock in the North West Pacific because they only wanted the roe. Fleets from South Korea, Taiwan and China were also among those dumping Pacific fish. Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-fish-idUSKBN19H1A8"},

Rangsiman Rome, 25, who was arrested on Sunday, was charged by a military prosecutor in Bangkok. He faces four charges including taking part in an illegal gathering in 2015 and defying a junta order by distributing leaflets against a constitutional referendum in 2016. The military overthrew an elected government in May 2014, saying it had to restore order after months of at time violent protests against the ruling populist party. Since then, the junta has issued edicts aimed at censoring the media and preventing public gatherings of more than five people, among others, in an attempt to impose order in the politically divided country following years of unrest. Rangsiman, a former student at Bangkok's Thammasat University, told reporters as he entered a military court that he believed he was arrested over questions he had raised over a $5 billion Thai-Chinese railway project rather than his political activity. The rail project has been promoted by the junta as an ambitious infrastructure project that will revamp Thailand's aging rail network and boost regional trade but it has been mired in delays.[nL3N1JA4BD]  I think this is about my plan to go to the Government House to ask for details on the Thai-Chinese project,  said Rangsiman. Some people have criticized the rail project saying China should shoulder more of the costs. The government is sensitive  about such criticism. Yaowalak Anupan, a lawyer for Rangsiman, said her client had been granted bail on condition that he did not leave the country or participate in political activities. Authorities on Saturday detained an activist attempting to mark a 1932 revolution that ended absolute monarchy, a development celebrated by pro-democracy activists but which has become increasingly taboo under the junta, which has taken a tough stand against critics of the monarchy. The activist was later released. Voters overwhelmingly approved a military-backed constitution in August 2016. Rights groups say the military government used repressive tactics to undermine critics of the new constitution. Some say the charter will consolidate military rule by ensuring the generals have a say in political life, even after  a general election tentatively set for 2018.

A decade-long study, the first global review since 2005 and based on work by 300 experts, said the rate of discards was still high despite a decline from a peak in the late 1980s. Discarded fish are usually dead or dying. Almost 10 million tonnes of about 100 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the past decade were thrown back into the sea, according to the  Sea Around Us  review by the University of British Columbia and the University of Western Australia. Industrial fleets often throw back fish that are damaged, diseased, too small or of an unwanted species. A trawler with a quota only to catch North Atlantic cod, for instance, may throw back hake caught in the same net. Discards are an  enormous waste ... especially at a time when wild capture fisheries are under global strain amidst growing demands for food security and human nutritional health,  they wrote in the journal Fish & Fisheries. The report welcomed the decline in discards from a peak of about 19 million tonnes in 1989, roughly 15 percent of a total catch of 130 million tonnes. The fall may be linked to restrictions in some nations on discards and improved fishing gear. Also, a rise in the price of fishmeal for aquaculture made it profitable to keep formerly low-value species, it said. But it might just reflect a lack of fish.  We suspect that (the decline) is because overfishing ... has already depleted the species being discarded,  lead author Dirk Zeller of the University of Western Australia told Reuters. Few fish survive getting thrown back although some species such as sharks, rays or crustaceans are more resilient. The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization last estimated, in 2005, that eight percent of fish were discarded from 1992-2001. Those numbers, using different methods, are not directly comparable with the Sea Around Us data. The scientists said discards were now highest in the Pacific, a shift from the Atlantic. Russian fleets, for instance, discarded large amounts of Alaska pollock in the North West Pacific because they only wanted the roe. Fleets from South Korea, Taiwan and China were also among those dumping Pacific fish. Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/environment-fish-idUSL8N1JN1G2"},

Sources with knowledge of COFCO's expansion strategy say the state-run conglomerate is struggling to integrate businesses it bought three years ago, deals which made it a significant global agricultural trader but are now hindering its ability to swoop on rivals. Illustrating the problems, the sources said that at times different arms of the agribusiness had tried to compete against each other in commodity deals. On top of this, several senior staff had recently left its trading operations while a heavy group debt burden presented another impediment to further mergers and acquisitions.  For now, the focus is on reorganization and digesting the acquisitions,  said a COFCO official, who declined to be identified.  Thoughts of further aggressive M&A; or building assets are on the backburner for at least a couple of years,  the official told Reuters. Spokespeople for COFCO Group and its newly-formed COFCO International trading arm did not respond to requests for comment. One of about 100 conglomerates controlled by China's central government, COFCO Group has interests that include hotels, real estate and some of China's leading food and drink brands including GreatWall wine. It trades more than 78 million tonnes of grain a year, according to state media, and in 2014 agreed to buy Dutch grain trader Nidera and the agribusiness of Singapore-listed Noble Group for more than $3 billion.  The deals gave COFCO assets in some of the top grain, vegetable oil, sugar and coffee producing regions. They also allowed it to start challenging the  ABCD  quartet of agricultural commodity traders - Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Bunge, Cargill [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus Company [AKIRAU.UL] - which have long dominated the global business. These firms were once highly profitable but in recent years record stocks of commodities such as corn, soybeans and wheat have sliced margins and dampened trading opportunities. A first sign of sweeping change for the industry emerged last month when Swiss mining and commodities group Glencore Plc made an informal approach to Bunge to discuss  a possible consensual business combination . While Bunge said it was not engaging in such talks, some kind of industry consolidation seems unavoidable and some people had said Glencore's move might spur COFCO into M&A; action.  For the past year I've expected that it would be COFCO that would go after Bunge. This may motivate them further,  Jay O'Neil, an agricultural economist at Kansas State University, said last month. Sources familiar with COFCO's thinking, however, also played down this possibility.  The company has suffered a lot because of the lengthy process of going toward one group,  one of the sources said.  It will take some time to repair the damage of the last couple of years.  As COFCO Group is a state-owned enterprise, any acquisition would also need Chinese government approval, which could be a lengthy process. Cofco International COFCO unveiled its new division, COFCO International, on April 24, bringing together Nidera and its Swiss-based grain arm COFCO Agri under new chief executive Johnny Chi.  According to its website, the company aims to expand its business globally and  strengthen worldwide origination, logistics and trading capabilities  supported by COFCO's unique position in China.   The company has increased staff numbers in Geneva, home to  COFCO International's headquarters and the center of its grains and oilseeds business. Its Rotterdam office separately plays a core role in trading activities. Since the start of the year, COFCO has tried to replace two top officials at COFCO Agri, who sources said left due to disagreements over the direction of the group.  FILE PHOTO: The company logo of China Oil and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) is seen at its headquarters in Beijing, China, November 3, 2016.Thomas Peter/File PhotoCompany memos seen by Reuters showed that there has also been a string of departures in recent weeks, including head trader Wolfgang Stiehler, who had joined Nidera only in January this year to provide strategy also. Stiehler did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Other officials who have left included traders, back office staff and local country managers, the memos showed.      A second source said Nidera and COFCO Agri had recently tried to compete for the same grain deal. While the duplication was eventually prevented, there were other similar instances and it was unclear whether those were stopped.  How is this supposed to happen if it's one company?  the source added.  The transition into a merger is looking more difficult than people thought. The merger is complex and will not be quick,  a third source said.  Two of the sources said separately that COFCO Agri was still buying grains from bigger rivals such as ADM, even though COFCO International was operational. This was due to the need to hedge deals, or to ensure they are completed promptly, one of the sources said. Debt and Cash FILE PHOTO: Grain is loaded onto ships for export at a port on the Parana river near Rosario, Argentina January 31, 2017.Marcos Brindicci/File PhotoAnother obstacle to more acquisitions is COFCO's debt and cash position. Data from its results showed the group's total debt had risen to 51.88 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) in 2016 from 50.63 billion yuan the previous year.  Separately, the parent group's cash and cash equivalent position dropped to 1.28 billion yuan in 2016 from 4.13 billion yuan in the previous year. COFCO group's operating profit fell to 0.85 billion yuan in 2016 from 1.96 billion in 2015.   COFCO International's shareholders also include Singapore state investor Temasek, China-based private equity firm HOPU Investments, Standard Chartered and the World Bank's private sector investment arm IFC, according to regulatory statements. Temasek, HOPU and Standard Chartered all declined to comment, while COFCO's investor relations department declined to provide details about the size of shareholdings in COFCO International. An IFC spokesman confirmed it had invested in the company but gave no details of the stake.   South American Growth Since first investing in Nidera, COFCO has reported several major problems, including a $150 million financial hole in its Latin American operations and $200 million in unauthorized trading losses on its biofuels desk in the region. However, it has also made progress there. Data seen by Reuters showed COFCO, through Nidera's and Noble Agri's existing operations, has become the second biggest grain exporter from Argentina, behind Cargill.  In Brazil, data showed that COFCO had moved up to the no. 4 grain exporter slot in 2016, ahead of Louis Dreyfus.  It's a new company with a lot of people coming from other firms,  said Joseph Reiner, COFCO International's Brazil-based global head of coffee.  Growth has to be sustainable, considering resources and results,  he told Reuters. COFCO is already gaining prominence in the sugar market. Last month it sold the bulk of sugar - primarily sourced from Brazil - against the May ICE futures raw sugar contract. This was the second-largest delivery against the contract.  COFCO is estimated to rank as Brazil's no. 6 sugar player. Marcelo de Andrade, Sao Paulo-based president of global sugar at COFCO International, said the firm had looked at possible purchases of sugar mills in Brazil  but decided to abort any deals .   At the moment we are not looking (at buying) any more and we are keen to fill as much as possible our current crushing capacity,  he told Reuters.

Rome on Sunday approved an emergency decree that leaves the best assets of Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca in the hands of Intesa Sanpaolo, which is taking them on at the symbolic price of just one euro. The government will pay 5.2 billion euros to Intesa, Italy's top retail bank, to ensure its capital ratios and dividend policy will not be affected by the deal, and give it guarantees of up 12 billion euros to shield it from any unexpected loss. The total exposure for the state is for up to 17 billion euros, although the Italian treasury estimates the final bill will be much lower than that. After drawn-out negotiations with Brussels, Italy won permission to liquidate the two banks under national insolvency procedures rather than have European regulators pull the plug on their own, potentially harsher, terms. The Veneto deal comes after Rome was also allowed to bail out the country's fourth biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena for up to 6.6 billion euros, removing another systemic threat and helping restore confidence in Italy's fragile financial industry. To do that, however, the government has potentially used up the whole 20 billion euros it had set aside to help ailing banks.  This is a major step in the direction of a cleaner Italian banking sector. Monte dei Paschi, Veneto and Vicenza were the three main concerns and they are now dealt with - one way or another,  fund manager Axiom Alternative Investments said in a note. Shares in Intesa, which is essentially cherry-picking the two banks' best parts for free and is expected by some analysts to start making money on them in 2018, were up 4.3 percent at 1028 GMT. The Italian bank index was up 3.5 percent. On Monday, Intesa said it would close 600 branches and lay off 3,900 people as a result of the Veneto deal, but those restructuring costs are covered by public money. The whole banking system breathed a sigh of relief, as a wind-down of the two Veneto banks under EU rules meant to stop state bailouts would have cost other Italian lenders 12.5 billion euros to guarantee deposits below 100,000 euros - spreading losses across an already battered sector. The Monte dei Paschi and Veneto deals will take some 45 billion euros in bad loans off the banking sector's balance sheet. But even so, the Italian banking industry, Europe's fourth largest, remains saddled with some 300 billion euros of gross soured debts, the legacy of a deep recession and poor lending practices. Banks are under pressure to sell those debts, but are reluctant to do so as they would have to book further writedowns that could force them to tap the market for cash.

Senior officials from the U.S. Treasury and other government departments have turned to these otherwise confidential accounts several times a year to analyze the asset holdings of the central banks of Russia, China, Iraq, Turkey, Yemen, Libya and others, according to more than a dozen current and former senior Fed and Treasury officials. The U.S. central bank keeps a tight lid on information contained in these accounts. But according to the officials interviewed by Reuters, U.S. authorities regularly use a  need to know  confidentiality exception in the Fed's service contracts with foreign central banks. The exception has allowed Treasury, State and Fed officials without regular access to glean information about the movement of funds in and out of the accounts, those people said. Such information has helped Washington monitor economic sanctions, fight terror financing and money laundering, or get a fuller picture of market hot spots around the world. Some 250 foreign central banks and governments keep $3.3 trillion of their assets at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, about half of the world's official dollar reserves, using a service advertised in a 2015 slide presentation as  safe and confidential.  The Bank for International Settlements, other major central banks and some commercial banks offer similar services, and clients usually have more than just one account. But only the Fed offers direct access to U.S. debt markets and to the world's reserve currency, the dollar, making the U.S. central bank the top provider of this so-called custodial banking business. In all, the people interviewed by Reuters identified seven instances in the last 15 years in which the accounts gave U.S. authorities insights into the actions of foreign counterparts or market movements, at times leading to a specific U.S. response. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2tDxp7V) In one relatively recent case, data from these foreign accounts offered U.S. authorities a sense of the mood in Moscow in March 2014, after Russia's invasion of Crimea prompted the United States to respond with economic sanctions. When foreign holdings at the New York Fed plunged about $115 billion, U.S. officials confirmed what others could only suspect, according to two former Fed officials: Russia's central bank had pulled its funds. While the Kremlin's public response was defiant, Fed and Treasury officials concluded Moscow feared the United States would freeze Russia's assets even though the account was not included in the narrow scope of the sanctions, according to one former official. After about two weeks, Russia's central bank returned most of the money to its Fed account, but the incident made officials monitor the account more closely for signs the sanctions had forced Moscow to draw down its reserves, the same source said. It was unclear what effect the sanctions had. The Bank of Russia said it would not comment on  details of its operations and interaction with partners.  The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to an emailed query. No Promise The Fed acknowledged the practice of disclosing account intelligence, but declined to comment on individual clients.  While our account agreement does provide for the sharing of information with the U.S. government in limited circumstances, we require a clearly demonstrated need for the information and a commitment that the information will be treated confidentially,  said a New York Fed spokeswoman.  This exception has been used on rare occasions and on a limited basis for such issues as compliance with sanctions requirements and anti-money laundering principles.  The insights into the Fed operation come at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump threatens new economic sanctions on countries that could again be monitored through the foreign accounts. It also comes as U.S. intelligence-gathering has come under intense public scrutiny, with agencies investigating Russian meddling in last year's election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign. The Senate this month backed new sanctions on Russia in part to punish it for the meddling, while the Treasury added individuals and entities to those sanctioned over Moscow's actions in Ukraine. According to a draft account agreement the New York Fed published online last year, the Treasury or any other U.S. government agency or Fed bank must have  a need to know such information  to access it. Seven people with direct knowledge of instances in which this exception was used told Reuters there was no working definition of the  need to know,  and that New York Fed lawyers would usually decide case by case. The level of scrutiny by U.S. authorities and lack of clarity over what would constitute a  need to know  surprised some former foreign central bankers who spoke to Reuters. The Bank of France, which also maintains foreign accounts, guarantees  full confidentiality  for its clients unless information is needed in a criminal investigation, said Christian Noyer, who was governor from 2003 to 2015.  It's only in that case,  he said in an interview.  It's not just to look at them and to know that.  Less surprising was the fact that the United States leveraged the Fed's position at the center of global finance, they said.  The kinds of powerful central banks that can offer these services ... will want to use that power in ways that benefit their public remit,  Patrick Honohan, governor of the Central Bank of Ireland from 2009 to 2015, told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: The seal for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is displayed in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 14, 2017.Joshua Roberts/File PhotoEdwin Truman, who headed the Fed Board of Governors' international finance division for more than two decades before joining the Treasury in 1998, said the Fed's clients should not expect absolute secrecy.  There is no promise to clients that the information in their accounts will not be shared with U.S. official circles,  Truman, now a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview.  A Treasury spokesman said the department monitors transactions and collects data from all financial firms  both routinely and in the course of investigations (and) has the ability to request information from banks beyond the 'need to know' provision.  He declined to comment on interactions with the New York Fed. Treasury Calling The U.S. officials interviewed by Reuters included executives and division heads, and people directly involved in discussions in which the confidentiality exception was used to analyze accounts that otherwise only a select group of Fed officials monitors. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity. Day to day, a team of about a dozen New York Fed analysts oversees the accounts. This low-profile unit, called Central Bank and International Account Services (CBIAS), came under the spotlight last year when it transferred $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account into the hands of hackers in one of the largest cyber heists ever. The unit manages mostly Treasury and agency debt. It also oversees more than 500,000 gold bars that have accumulated in underground vaults since the New York Fed first opened accounts for Britain and France a century ago. Slideshow (5 Images)The requests for information became more frequent after the passage of the 2001 U.S. Patriot Act, mostly from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a Treasury division enforcing sanctions and targeting terrorist financing, money laundering, and weapons and drugs trafficking. The Department can also subpoena confidential information. Among the requests since then have been inquiries about the accounts belonging to Turkey, Iraq, Russia and others, often to help determine whether official funds were being used to finance sanctioned groups or individuals, according to three of the sources. A few countries of keen interest to the U.S. government have little or no funds at the New York Fed - such as Iran, which is sanctioned, and Saudi Arabia, which is not. An official at Turkey's central bank said  operations are routinely carried out according to a correspondent banking agreement with the New York Fed, which is the standard operational procedure in correspondent banking.  Iraq's central bank stands out among those subject to U.S. scrutiny because of the extent of cooperation between Baghdad and New York. Earlier this month, based on information and instructions from the Fed's foreign accounts team, the Central Bank of Iraq blacklisted a money exchange firm suspected of ties with Islamic State and Al Qaeda. The Al-Kawthar money exchange firm, from the town of Qaim near the Syrian border, had its assets frozen in the action. Fed officials rely on meetings and conference calls to advise the Iraqi central bank on how to track and freeze out local firms suspected of terrorist connections or of helping Iran bypass sanctions, an Iraq central bank official told Reuters.  We have direct contact with the foreign assets monitoring office in the Fed,  the official said. In freezing the assets of Al-Kawthar, Iraq's central bank followed Fed  verification procedures,  added the official, who declined to be named. The U.S. Treasury announced the sanctions against Al-Kawthar on June 15, citing $2.5 million in money transfers it allegedly made to a firm linked to Islamic State facilitators. The owner of the money exchange firm was not available to comment.  Sometimes, a peek into the Fed accounts has provided the Treasury insight into market upheaval. At the height of the global financial crisis in 2008, Treasury officials asked the New York Fed whether one of its clients was behind plummeting demand for short-term debt of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to a former CBIAS official. An analysis of the accounts showed that China's central bank had curbed purchases, and that intelligence factored into the U.S. government's decision to seize the agencies in September 2008, the person said. The People's Bank of China declined to comment. In some cases, the Fed team handling the foreign accounts would activate the  need to know  clause if it spotted something unusual, two former Fed officials said. Since the 2010 Arab Spring uprisings, for example, the New York Fed has made several inquiries with the State Department about Yemeni and Libyan assets, according to one of these officials. The Fed team, which ranks accounts by levels of risk, sought clarity on whether the governments or insurgents were in control of those countries' central banks, the official said. A State Department official said it  maintains contact with counterparts in the Federal Reserve system to share information on political and security developments  so they can  better evaluate and understand foreign governmental structures, leadership, and financial risk.  Representatives of Libya's and Yemen's central banks, as well as Yemen's embassy in Washington, did not respond to requests for comment.

Fans of table tennis, China's unofficial national sport, flocked online to vent their anger over the removal of the national team's popular head coach, Liu Guoliang, who stepped down from his position last week. The country's three top players also boycotted a tournament on Friday and posted statements online:  We don't feel like playing any more right now, because we miss you Liu Guoliang.  In response, mentions of Liu, ping pong and Gou Zhongwen, the director of China's powerful General Administration of Sport, became the top censored words online on Monday, according to Free Weibo, a censorship-tracking site. The uproar, and the rush to quell it, underscores growing unrest with China's Soviet-style management of sports, where Beijing still often plays a controlling role, even as it looks to foster a multi-billion dollar sporting market. In sports like soccer, the government has promised more autonomy for sporting bodies, but heavy-handed regulation has pointed to continued involvement of the state behind the scenes.  After Liu's removal he was reassigned as one of a large number of vice presidents of the China Table Tennis Association.

By Jamie McGeever LONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - If central banks have learned anything from the Great Financial Crisis, the worst since the 1930s, it is that you don't need runaway inflation to raise interest rates. Financial market bubbles should be enough. The Bank for International Settlements, often considered the central bank to the world's central banks, warned on Sunday that policymakers should press ahead with the  great unwinding  of post-crisis stimulus, even if  some short-term bumps in the road  are inevitable. Inflation shouldn't be the  be all and end all  of monetary policy, according to BIS head of research Hyun Shin. Instead,  a bit more emphasis  should be put on financial developments such as the rise in credit growth and the potential economic costs of bubbles bursting. Shin and his colleagues should be listened to. The BIS was one of the few institutions warning that the credit bubble being inflated by the Alan Greenspan Fed's super-lax policy in the mid-2000s would burst with disastrous consequences. But even after the financial crisis plunged the world into recession and scarily close to another Great Depression, inflation is still the  be all and end all  for central banks across the developed world. Parallels between now and then are emerging. Inflation in the industrialised world is now broadly where it was a decade ago: extremely well contained and below most central banks' 2 percent target. Against a backdrop of anemic wage growth and oil slumping 20 percent in the last two months, there's little sign of it accelerating any time soon. In that light, the subtle but notable shift among major central banks recently towards policy  normalisation  is unwarranted. But while inflation poses no threat, the same cannot be said with any surety about financial markets. The warning signs are there: world stocks are the highest on record, volatility is the lowest in decades, and in credit, emerging market and high yield spreads are the narrowest in years. Despite the Fed raising rates, U.S. financial conditions are the easiest in over two years, according to Goldman Sachs. Credit growth and global debt are now higher than they were before the crisis. Bubbles are forming in equity and other markets, inflated by global central bank stimulus which is still running at nearly $200 billion a month. Reflecting investors' hunt for yield, Argentina last week issued a 100-year bond at a yield of less than 8 percent. Argentina has defaulted at least eight times since gaining independence in 1816 and has been in a state of default more than half of all days since 1980. Yet investors snapped it up. As Citi's Matt King notes, markets remain  in thrall to central banks . Grin and Bear It This is why tighter policy globally could be potentially seismic for markets. Investors have grown fat and happy on more than two decades of policymakers targeting inflation at 2 percent and offering the implicit insurance policy of the central bank  put . That's the belief that central banks will do whatever it takes to avoid the financial and economic damage a crash would unleash. Essentially that means maintaining a loose monetary policy and the flow of liquidity into financial assets. Last week Bill Dudley, president of the New York Fed, and Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, jolted markets by signaling their readiness to raise rates. The Fed has already raised rates four times and is about to reduce its balance sheet, and the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada to varying degrees have made it clear that the post-crisis stimulus should soon be gradually withdrawn. The arguments against using monetary policy to curb financial market excesses are well-known, powerful, and held by most of the world's central banking elite over the past quarter century. It's too blunt a tool, the concept of financial stability is too vague, it's impossible to accurately identify asset bubbles, the economic and financial fallout from pricking these bubbles is unknowable at best and catastrophic at worst. Ultimately it's not the business of central banks to be micro-managing markets. It's not their remit. Central bankers including Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Mervyn King, Lars Svensson and Jens Weidmann have argued that monetary authorities should resist leaning against the wind and trying to control or even prevent incipient financial booms. But in recent years the Fed has acknowledged the risks posed by ultra-low volatility and increased risk-taking. In 2014 Janet Yellen said high yield, or  junk  bonds were on the Fed's radar, warning that a sharp unwind of risk-taking behaviour in general would be something to avoid. A major shakeout in U.S. high yield bonds followed and yields jumped to 10 percent in early 2016. But they're now back to historic lows around 5.5 percent, the recovery coinciding almost exactly with the most gradual Fed tightening cycle in history. This shows that higher rates are failing to quell animal spirits. On this issue, Shin at the BIS and perma-bear Albert Edwards at Societe Generale agree that the longer bubbles are left to inflate, the greater the disaster when they pop. Edwards points out the irony in trying to reflate the economy through ultra-loose policy because bursting bubbles will take down the economy and probably deliver the very deflation policymakers were seeking to avoid in the first place.  Even after the (Great Financial Crisis) they simply have not learnt that loose money polices to blow asset price bubbles is a catastrophic policy destined to end in failure,  Edwards warns.

Around 450 people were still waiting to return to their homes on Monday while more than 400 firefighters and soldiers worked to extinguish the flames using dozens of vehicles and 14 aircraft, officials said.  Slideshow (7 Images)A heatwave has gripped the Iberian peninsular over the past few days, bringing water reservoir levels to record lows and pushing temperatures to over 40 Celsius (104F) in the southern region of Andalusia.  Forest fires in Portugal last week killed more than 60 people. Many of the dead were villagers who perished in their cars while trying to escape the flames. No deaths have been reported in the Spanish fires. Donana National Park is an area around the size of Chicago containing marshes, streams and sand dunes and is home to rare species such as the Spanish imperial eagle and the Iberian lynx, the world's most endangered feline. Prospects of containing the fire by the end of Monday were good, said Jose Fiscal, head of the Andalusian government's environmental unit in an interview on Onda Cera radio.     On Sunday, workers at the El Acebuche breeding center caught nine lynx adults and five kittens for evacuation when fire threatened the establishment, a spokesman for the environmental ministry said. One animal died in the process, possibly due to stress. However, 13 animals could not be caught and the doors of the center were left open for the lynx to escape should the fire engulf the facility, the ministry said. On Monday, workers were told they could return to the center with the displaced animals. Editing by Paul Day and Robin Pomeroy","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-fires-idUSKBN19H166"},

The Bank of Italy's Deputy Governor Fabio Panetta told a press briefing on Monday that Monte dei Paschi's bailout was a  a done deal.  At the same briefing, Chief Supervisor Carmelo Barbagallo said the EU Commission had only to formalize its approval but there were no doubts that, unlike regional rival Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, Monte dei Paschi would be able to tap state aid to remain in business. Barbagallo said Monte dei Paschi would close a bad loan sale, a key plank of its rescue plan, thanks to the fact that banking industry bailout fund Atlante could now divert cash  previously earmarked for the Veneto banks' soured debts to buy Monte dei Paschi's bad loans.

L1 Retail, part of Fridman's empire that spans investments in ride-hailing firm Uber to North Sea assets, said it expected to complete the purchase from The Nature's Bounty Co. and The Carlyle Group by September, subject to regulatory approvals. Britain's retailers face an uncertain future, with consumer spending slowing and online competition picking up. Luxury clothing chain Jaeger fell into administration in April, while dealmaking has also been on the rise, with Brazil's Natura set to buy The Body Shop from L'Oreal.  However, some industry experts think healthier foods could prove a resilient part of the market, with online giant Amazon.com (AMZN.O) agreeing to buy U.S. chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion earlier this month. Researchers Euromonitor reckon the health and wellness market grew 4.8 percent a year between 2011 and 2016, reaching a total value of $704 billion last year. Holland & Barrett, whose products range from vitamins and homeopathic remedies to  free from  foods for allergy sufferers, says it has grown same-store sales for 32 consecutive quarters, with revenues topping 610 million pounds in 2016.  While focused mainly in Britain, the 1,000-plus store chain has been expanding abroad as well as online, helping to catch L1 Retail's eye.   We believe that the company is well positioned to benefit from structural growth in the ... health and wellness market and has multiple levers for long term growth and value creation,  said L1 Retail managing partner Stephen DuCharme. Holland & Barrett was founded in 1870, but traces its roots in health and wellness back to 1920 when Samuel Ryder - who went on to sponsor the international golf tournament that bears his name - set up a company specializing in herbs. 'Push Back' Jonathan Buxton, partner and head of retail at Cavendish Corporate Finance, said the takeover by L1 Retail could help Holland & Barrett fend off growing competition.   With this kind of investment, we would expect that the retailer will continue to invest in its stores but more importantly, seek to increase its online presence to push back against the likes of Amazon following its acquisition of Whole Foods,  he said.  According to Forbes, Fridman reached the seventh spot in Russia's 2017 rich list, with wealth of $14.4 billion. Though he has moved his base to London from Moscow, the 53-year-old and his partners still own major assets in several industries in Russia, including a majority stake in Russia's biggest food retailer by sales X5 Retail, top-10 lender Alfa Bank and Russia's third-biggest mobile operator Vimpelcom. However, since selling out of oil company TNK-BP to Russia's state-owned energy group Rosneft (ROSN.MM) in 2013, they have largely sought to invest outside Russia. L1 Retail's advisers include Karl-Heinz Holland, former CEO of German discount retailer Lidl Group, and Clive Humby, a founder of retail data pioneer dunnhumby. A spokesman for L1 told Reuters the company would create a board for Holland & Barrett that would include L1 Retail's advisory board and investment team, possibly some outside non-executive directors and the chief executive and chief financial officer of the chain. Private equity firm Carlyle acquired Nature's Bounty, including Holland & Barrett, in 2010 for $3.8 billion.

It did not give a reason for the failure. However, the Israeli government has expressed concerns over the purchase of key financial assets such as insurers by Chinese investors, fretting over pension cash. Delek, which holds significant stakes in Israel's largest natural gas fields and other energy assets, is required to sell some of its financial assets under a new Israeli regulation that prohibits large domestic conglomerates from holding both financial and non-financial businesses. Delek signed a binding agreement last August to sell its 52.3 percent stake in Phoenix to Yango for 1.97 billion shekels ($557 million). That price was raised to 2.15 billion shekels in April.  Due to the prolonged process of obtaining the approval for the sale of control in Phoenix to Yango Group, the two sides agreed today, June 26, to cancel the agreement,  Delek said in a statement.  The company has been approached by other entities in Israel and abroad regarding the sale of its holdings in Phoenix and will continue to act to sell its holdings as required by law.  In March last year a non-binding agreement by Delek to sell Phoenix to a U.S. insurer, which industry sources identified as AmTrust FinancialServices, was cancelled by both sides. Delek had previously agreed to sell its Phoenix stake to China's Fosun International for 1.8 billion shekels but the deal collapsed when conditions were not met. The IDB Development group, another Israeli conglomerate, has also faced regulatory difficulties in its attempts to sell control of Clal Insurance to Chinese investors.

Wall was previously chairman of corporate banking and vice-chairman of investment banking, and his appointment is seen as a sign the Dublin operations could become more significant. Barclays said on Monday he will be responsible for the ongoing growth and development of the bank in Ireland. Barclays has a licence in Dublin and could shift staff and business there if needed, people familiar with the situation have said. That could involve 100-150 staff moving. The bank has not made any announcement on any relocation plans to cope with Brexit, though several other banks have outlined some of their plans. JP Morgan last month agreed to buy a Dublin building with room for 1,000 staff in the first sign of a financial services company expanding significantly in Ireland in the wake of the Brexit vote. Wall will take up his position immediately. He joined Barclays in 1981 and has held roles in project finance, foreign exchange and investment banking in the UK, the US and Asia, and had London-based management roles in strategic planning and human resources. He succeeds Sasha Wiggins as CEO in Ireland. Wiggins will take up a new role as head of east and southeast in UK corporate banking.

Chicago first baseman Anthony Rizzo, one of the team’s hottest hitters of late, is 2-for-20 with six strikeouts against Gonzalez.

The 26-year-old allowed only one run and five hits Wednesday against San Diego, but he ran up a high pitch count and left without recording an out in the fifth.

Gonzalez is well on his way to an eighth straight season with double-digit wins, and he has won four straight decisions with his last loss coming May 8 at Baltimore.

Kendrick has become a valuable trade chip for the Phillies while hitting .361 with two home runs and 13 RBIs in 32 games, but he’s been limited to pinch-hit duties since Thursday with tightness in his left hamstring.

Parker Bridwell pitched into the seventh inning and Ben Revere contributed three hits in Sunday’s 4-2 win over Boston as the Angels improved to 14-12 without injured star Mike Trout, who hopes to return before the All-Star game on July 11. “We’re right in the mix,” Revere told reporters. “We have a good ball club. With all the injuries we’ve had this year, we’re right there. We can compete against these good ball clubs here.” The Angels will be hard-pressed to slow down a powerful Dodgers offense led by rookie slugger Cody Bellinger, who homered twice and drove in four runs in Sunday’s 12-6 win over Colorado and has hit the most homers in the history of baseball (24) through 57 career games.

Colorado extended its season-high losing streak to five games with an ugly 12-6 loss to the Dodgers in Los Angeles on Sunday while San Francisco attempts to halt three five-game slides -- overall, at home and against the Rockies. The Giants are coming off an 8-2 home loss to the New York Mets on Sunday that dropped them to 5-21 since back-to-back triumphs over Atlanta on May 27 and 28. Colorado, which led the National League West by one-half game Tuesday, suddenly finds itself 4 1/2 games behind Los Angeles, but still owns a comfortable advantage in the wild-card race. The Rockies were extremely generous Sunday as they squandered a 6-4 lead by allowing the final eight runs of the game - including five in a row on four wild pitches over two innings by reliever Adam Ottavino. DJ LeMahieu has been swinging a hot bat of late, going 4-for-9 in his last two games while hitting safely in 19 of his last 22 contests - recording 11 multi-hit performances in that span. TV: 10:08 p.m. ET, ESPN, ROOT Rocky Mountain (Colorado), NBCSN Bay Area (San Francisco) PITCHING MATCHUP: Rockies RH German Marquez (5-3, 3.92 ERA) vs. Giants RH Jeff Samardzija (2-9, 4.74) Marquez has allowed only one earned run in each of his last three turns, including a brief three-inning stint against the Cubs in Chicago, but has recorded only one victory in that span. The 22-year-old Venezuelan has won five of his last six decisions, giving up fewer than two earned runs in four of the triumphs - and two in the other. Marquez lost his only career start versus the Giants as he yielded six runs and 12 hits over 4 1/3 frames at San Francisco on Sept. 27. Samardzija has won only one of his last seven outings despite allowing fewer than four runs six times in that stretch. The lone turn in which he surrendered more was a loss at Colorado on June 16, when he was tagged for eight runs and 11 hits over six innings. That setback dropped Samardzija to 0-3 with a 9.33 ERA versus the Rockies this season and 3-5 with a 3.91 ERA in 14 career appearances (10 starts). Walk-Offs 1. Rockies OF Carlos Gonzalez missed the three-game series against the Dodgers because of a sore right shoulder and is hoping to avoid a stint on the disabled list. 2.

The Cardinals ended a five-game slide at home with Sunday's 8-4 victory over Pittsburgh and look to reach the .500 mark at Busch Stadium, where they are 19-20. St. Louis' Randal Grichuk was one of three players brought up from Triple-A Memphis on Sunday and paid immediate dividends, going 2-for-5 with a solo home run estimated at 478 feet - the longest by a Cardinal in the 12-year history of the third version of Busch. Cincinnati halted a four-game losing streak Sunday, improving to 2-4 on its seven-game road trip with a 6-2 victory at Washington. Scooter Gennett was the offensive star for the Reds as he went 4-for-5 with two RBIs and his fourth home run in seven contests. The 27-year-old Gennett has gone deep eight times this month and is three blasts away from tying his career high of 14, which he set with Milwaukee last season.

Wacha worked fewer than five innings for the fifth time in six turns on Wednesday but came away with his seventh no-decision in 10 outings after yielding five runs - two earned - and nine hits over four frames at Philadelphia. The 25-year-old native of Iowa has recorded only one triumph since winning two of his first three starts of the season and has surrendered four or more runs in five of his last six outings. Wacha improved to 7-1 lifetime against the Reds after allowing one run and three hits over six innings en route to victory in his season debut on April 8. Walk-Offs 1.

My in-laws gave us two piglets, which brought us manure to farm a plot of leased land, crops we could sell at the market, and ultimately enough money to buy our own piece of land,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, keeping an eye on her constantly buzzing phone. Today she owns a dozen acres of land, where she has trained hundreds of students and farmers – among others – on organic farming practices as a means of adapting to Uganda's increasingly erratic climate. Although most farmers in Uganda own or rent a plot of land, however small, many lack the knowledge and skills to cope with increasingly extreme weather events like longer dry spells and erratic rainfall, agricultural experts in the area say.  In times of extreme weather many [farmers] carry on farming the same way they've always known, and see their yields decline as a result,  explained Deziderius Irumba, a learning coordinator at charity Care International.   If the rains don't come, for example, they just wait, and by the time the rains do come many of their crops will have already failed due to pests,  he said. Efforts to change that are underway, however, by training farmers - but also entrepreneurs, students and journalists - on climate change and efforts to adapt to it, and encouraging them to share that knowledge among their networks. Since 2015 the campaign has trained over 1,000 people in partnership with Uganda's Makerere University. The most promising have been elected 'climate champions' by their peers, and are then responsible for training others. The initiative, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, is called Uganda Education and Research to Improve Climate Change Adaptation Activity.  The idea is to show people that climate change affects every one of us, but also to explain how they can do something about it, so they hopefully become inspired to take action and become a go-to person in their area,  said Sarah Fortunate, a climate adaptation specialist who coordinates the project. Smart Farming Kiiza, who became a climate champion in 2015 and whose five children are also champions, showcases a range of farming practices at her farm. Those include building underground water tanks to harvest rainwater while limiting evaporation, and planting herbs in jerrycans tied to wood boards to maximize farming space.  I try to make the most of the resources I have, whether it's building a drip irrigator out of a plastic bottle or putting dirt in a used tire to grow vegetables,  she said, bending to examine a patch of spinach. Geoffrey Mabirizi, another farmer and champion from a nearby village, teaches his neighbors to do intercropping – growing two or more crops together so they have a crop to fall back on if one harvest fails. He said it doesn't matter whether those he trains are farmers or others who can help spread the news about new ideas.  Journalists or traders, for example can be just as influential as farmers by spreading the climate and farming advice they've received to their readers or clients,  he said. Although training sessions are open to people of all ages, the project has in particular set up week-long  bootcamps  for university students to help them learn about climate change and brainstorm ideas on how to adapt to it. Fortunate said students at a recent bootcamp decided to design teaching materials on climate change and smart farming for primary school students. Women at work on the farm of Geoffrey Mabirizi, who is adopting climate-smart farming techniques, in Masaka, Uganda, June 24, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Zoe TabaryShe hopes to get those educational aids approved by the government  so they are everywhere . Show, Don't Tell Key to the trainings, said Mabirizi, is teaching practice rather than theory.   In my first training I talked about carbon dioxide, about adaptation, and I completely lost them,  he admitted.  They would ask questions like 'How do you know this is carbon dioxide'? Even I started to get confused!  he laughed.  So I decided to go back to basics – that is, demonstrating smart farming practices to trainees rather than just telling them what to do.  Vegetables growing in jerrycans tied to wood boards are seen at climate champion Josephine Kiiza’s farm in Masaka, Uganda, June 23, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Zoe TabaryEven then, less than half go on to implement the techniques based just on the training, he said.  So if you can, the best thing is to go to their farm or home and show them what to do.   Efforts to work with farmers need to start with women, who are more financially vulnerable than men, Kiiza said.  Many women I met throughout the country, especially widows whose husbands had died of AIDS, could only afford to eat one meal per day and were severely malnourished,  she said. But women can be excellent messengers for the new ideas, she said.   When you talk to a woman, you effectively get access to her whole family, as women know everything that's going on,  she said.  So if you're trying to reach farmers, women can be a powerful communication tool.  Scaling Up Although many champions stay in touch with each other after meeting at in-person trainings, there is no formal platform yet for them all to do so, Fortunate said.  So we'd like to set up an online forum or a WhatsApp group where they can share experiences,  she said. Some champions are already doing this themselves. Mabirizi said he has  over 20 WhatsApp groups with farmers and trainees, where I try to take a few minutes every evening to answer questions . The next step for the project, said Fortunate, is to help 40 university students secure three-month internships with farmers who are also climate champions in their area.  That will grow our pool of trainers, but also make the students more employable,  she said. Reporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, editing by Laurie Goering.

L1 Retail, part of Fridman's empire that spans investments in ride-hailing firm Uber to North Sea assets, said it expected to complete the purchase from The Nature's Bounty Co. and The Carlyle Group by September, subject to regulatory approvals. Britain's retailers face an uncertain future, with consumer spending slowing and online competition picking up. Luxury clothing chain Jaeger fell into administration in April, while dealmaking has also been on the rise, with Brazil's Natura set to buy The Body Shop from L'Oreal.  However, some industry experts think healthier foods could prove a resilient part of the market, with online giant Amazon.com (AMZN.O) agreeing to buy U.S. chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion earlier this month. Researchers Euromonitor reckon the health and wellness market grew 4.8 percent a year between 2011 and 2016, reaching a total value of $704 billion last year. Holland & Barrett, whose products range from vitamins and homeopathic remedies to  free from  foods for allergy sufferers, says it has grown same-store sales for 32 consecutive quarters, with revenues topping 610 million pounds in 2016.  While focused mainly in Britain, the 1,000-plus store chain has been expanding abroad as well as online, helping to catch L1 Retail's eye.   We believe that the company is well positioned to benefit from structural growth in the ... health and wellness market and has multiple levers for long term growth and value creation,  said L1 Retail managing partner Stephen DuCharme. Holland & Barrett was founded in 1870, but traces its roots in health and wellness back to 1920 when Samuel Ryder - who went on to sponsor the international golf tournament that bears his name - set up a company specializing in herbs. 'Push Back' Jonathan Buxton, partner and head of retail at Cavendish Corporate Finance, said the takeover by L1 Retail could help Holland & Barrett fend off growing competition.   With this kind of investment, we would expect that the retailer will continue to invest in its stores but more importantly, seek to increase its online presence to push back against the likes of Amazon following its acquisition of Whole Foods,  he said.  According to Forbes, Fridman reached the seventh spot in Russia's 2017 rich list, with wealth of $14.4 billion. Though he has moved his base to London from Moscow, the 53-year-old and his partners still own major assets in several industries in Russia, including a majority stake in Russia's biggest food retailer by sales X5 Retail, top-10 lender Alfa Bank and Russia's third-biggest mobile operator Vimpelcom. However, since selling out of oil company TNK-BP to Russia's state-owned energy group Rosneft (ROSN.MM) in 2013, they have largely sought to invest outside Russia. L1 Retail's advisers include Karl-Heinz Holland, former CEO of German discount retailer Lidl Group, and Clive Humby, a founder of retail data pioneer dunnhumby. A spokesman for L1 told Reuters the company would create a board for Holland & Barrett that would include L1 Retail's advisory board and investment team, possibly some outside non-executive directors and the chief executive and chief financial officer of the chain. Private equity firm Carlyle acquired Nature's Bounty, including Holland & Barrett, in 2010 for $3.8 billion.  Reuters reported in January that Carlyle had hired Goldman Sachs to help it sell Nature's Bounty, but that it might opt to sell Holland & Barrett separately. Carlyle was advised by Goldman Sachs, Houlihan Lokey, UBS, PwC, Latham Watkins and OC&C.; Additional reporting by Maria Kiselyova in Moscow; Editing by Simon Jessop and Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/hollandbarrett-ma-l1retail-idUSL8N1JN0U6"},

Barry Cadden, the co-founder and former president of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center, was convicted in March of those crimes by a federal jury in Boston but cleared of the harshest charges he faced, second-degree murder. Prosecutors are seeking at least 35 years in prison for Cadden, whose conduct they said led to 778 patients nationwide being harmed after receiving contaminated steroids injections. That includes 76 people who died, they said. His lawyers counter that prosecutors are seeking to demonize Cadden, who they said was not convicted of knowing the drugs were contaminated, just of misrepresenting how they were made. They say Cadden, 50, deserves around only three years in prison. Cadden was one of 14 people tied to Framingham, Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center (NECC) indicted in 2014 following the outbreak. He was one of only two people to face second-degree murder charges. Prosecutors said Cadden, NECC's head pharmacist, ran the company as a criminal enterprise that sold substandard and non-sterile drugs produced in filthy conditions and shipped to medical facilities nationally for use on unsuspecting patients. They said Cadden directed the shipment of 17,600 vials of contaminated steroids often prescribed for back pain despite knowing they were made in unsafe conditions, leading to the outbreak.

The Barclays Fortune 500 Equal Weighted Index will launch in July, tracking about 450 publicly traded companies with a combined revenue of more than $11 trillion, Dupe Adeyemo, a director at Barclays, told Reuters. The index will exclude private companies, master limited partnerships and companies that do not meet liquidity requirements among the Fortune 500, Adeyemo said. Time, which like many of its publishing peers has been struggling as print circulation shrinks and advertisers shift to digital platforms, will aim to broaden its revenue with the partnership as index-based investing is increasing in popularity.  We're trying to be more creative about ways to expand our brand,  said Brian O'Keefe, deputy editor of Fortune magazine.  Frankly, this index should have been done a long time ago.  In addition to the magazine, the brand hosts conferences such as the  Most Powerful Women Summit  and is expanding online. Time declined to discuss the financial terms of the partnership. Revenue-weighted and profit-weighted indexes are planned for the fourth quarter this year, Adeyemo said. “We think a name like Fortune that resonates with the public … will distinguish ourselves among other ETFs that come out in the market,” Adeyemo said. The Fortune 500 is an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks 500 of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue. It is unclear if Time Inc will be able to generate meaningful revenue by getting into the index business.  The licensing of indices is not a phenomenally lucrative business,  said Dave Nadig, chief executive officer of ETF.com, based in New York. Time evaluated a sale earlier this year, but talks with Meredith Corp failed when the two could not agree on price . Earlier this month, Time eliminated 300 positions or 4 percent of its workforce. Over the past 12 months, index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds pulled in $718 billion, while active funds bled $152 billion, according to the Thomson Reuters research service Lipper.

Pensioner Fotini Papadaki held her nose as she added her own small bag to the mounds.  It's deplorable, I understand job worries but taking it out on society ... is going too far,  she said. Around her, early morning commuters dodged past the reeking sacks as trash collectors and other municipal workers entered the second week of their walkout. The strikers fear job losses as Greece wrestles with its seventh year of austerity demanded by international creditors.  More specifically, the workers want better terms for short-term staff threatened, they say, by a court order banning extensions to their contracts. Many residents, battered by the same spending cuts, were sympathetic at the start. But that support has come under strain as the rubbish bags pile up in the baking summer sun.

Slideshow (3 Images)Authorities have asked people to keep their trash at home, though for flat-dwellers like Fotini Papadaki, there is only so much room on their balconies.  Some municipalities, including Thessaloniki in the north, have turned to the private sector to alleviate the situation, outsourcing rubbish removal. It remains to be seen how long their strained budgets can take the extra cost. And the strikers are showing no signs of backing down.

If banks are unprofitable, it is better to let them exit the market than keep them artificially alive with precautionary recapitalisation. The use of state aid should be avoided as much as possible in bankruptcy cases,  she said. It was up to the European Commission, which approved the Italian deal, to keep state aid to a minimum, she said, adding compensation for small private investors could, in exceptional cases, be compatible with European rules. $1 = 0.8946 euros Reporting by Madeline Chambers and Paul Carrel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-banks-italy-germany-idUSB4N1IQ010"},

Melbourne-based Crown, 49 percent owned by billionaire James Packer, said in a statement the employees were jailed for between nine to ten months and handed a total fine of 8.62 million yuan ($1.26 million), which Crown would pay. The sentences will run from the date the employees were first detained on Oct. 14 last year, meaning they would only have a couple of months left to serve. A lawyer for the defendants said they were  satisfied with the result . The case prompted Crown, the world's biggest listed casino company outside of China, to retreat from global expansion plans and sell off assets in China's gambling hub Macau, and instead shift its focus back home. The Australian consul general in Shanghai, Graeme Meehan, earlier told reporters outside the Baoshan District Court that Crown's head of international VIP gambling Jason O'Connor was given a ten month sentence. The two other Australians, Jane Pan and Jerry Xuan, were handed nine month sentences. A total of 19 defendants, also including one Malaysian citizen, were formally charged earlier this month, having been first detained late last year. Zhai Jian, a defence lawyer, said the defendants had pled guilty. Related CoverageAustralia's Crown says fined by Chinese court over gaming offencesThree of the defendants, who were granted bail in November, were not fined or given a jail sentence, Crown said.  Crown remains respectful of the sovereign jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China,  the firm added. Gambling Crackdown The logo of Australian casino giant Crown Resorts Ltd adorns the hotel and casino complex in Melbourne, Australia, June 13, 2017.Jason ReedAt the end of the swift trial that only began on Monday morning, relatives and lawyers were whisked away. Journalists had been barred from attending the proceedings. The husband of one defendant told Reuters after the trial the outcome was better than he had hoped. Requesting anonymity, he said his wife was given a nine month sentence and would be released on July 14. Donald Rothwell, a professor of international law at the Australian National University, said the guilty pleas had helped the employees avoid longer sentences, though added the case did underline legal risks of doing business in the country.  The case was part of a wider crackdown on gambling in China. Crown does not directly run casinos in China, but last month it sold its remaining stake in Macau-focused Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd for $1.16 billion. The company had also been engaged in a big push to lure Chinese gamblers to its Australian operations. Aside from pulling out of the Macau, Crown has quit an agreement to develop a casino in Las Vegas and cancelled an ambitious plan, which it floated before the arrests, to split into three separate companies - one of which would have included its offshore assets. China has been cracking down on attempts by casinos to woo high-spending Chinese gamblers within China. In 2015 thirteen South Korean casino managers were arrested in China for offering Chinese gamblers free tours, free hotels and sexual services. The trial is the latest in a series of high-profile cases in China involving foreign firms. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline PLC was fined nearly $500 million in 2014 and food maker OSI saw employees jailed last year.

The field, some 125 km (80 miles) east of the Shetland Islands, delivered its first oil on June 23 and is expected to produce 50,000 barrels per day at its peak, the company said in a statement on Monday. Shares in London-listed EnQuest were trading 9.3 percent higher at 0957 GMT following the announcement. The decision to develop the field to produce heavy oil was taken in 2013 when oil prices were above $100 a barrel and it was expected to have a life of more than 25 years with an average forecast for crude of $90 a barrel. The initial budget was about $2.8 billion but following a more than halving of oil prices since 2014, the company has sought to reduce Kraken's construction costs and its budget is now estimated at $2.5 billion, according to the EnQuest. The start of production is welcome news for EnQuest which is undergoing financial restructuring under Chief Executive Officer Amjad Bseisu in the face of the oil market downturn. EnQuest had $1.8 billion of debt at the end of last year and has a market value of $433.7 million (341 million pounds).  With production from Kraken, EnQuest is moving from a period of heavy capital investment, to a focus on cash generation and deleveraging the balance sheet,  Bseisu said. EnQuest has a 70.5 percent interest in Kraken and Cairn Energy owns the remaining 29.5 percent. EnQuest, which specialises in squeezing the remaining oil from ageing fields, was producing nearly 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) at the end of April and expects 2017 production to average between 45,000 boepd and 51,000 boepd. Analysts at Barclays said the first oil from Kraken was,  clearly a positive milestone for both EnQuest and Cairn; however, past experience tells us development risks remain through the production ramp-up phase.  New North Sea projects over the next two years will add a combined 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), offsetting a drop in output from other fields in the oldest deepwater basin which produces the world's benchmark crude Brent.

Lebanon's parliament approved the new law on 16 June 2017, following cabinet approval of a cross-party agreement to adopt proportional representation and reduce the number of electoral districts. Elections had been due by 20 June, but parliament will now be extended again while preparations are made for a vote under the new system in May 2018. Changing the electoral law to facilitate elections is another step towards improving political effectiveness, following the election of Michel Aoun as president last October after more than two years without a president, and the formation of a new government, drawn from across the political spectrum, in December. It has averted an impending political crisis, as Aoun had effectively set a 20 June deadline, and illustrates the ability of the main political factions in Lebanon to achieve compromises, albeit slowly and at the last minute. Maintaining this modest political momentum could further improve the prospects for policy making. The current government has largely been occupied with electoral law discussions, but it has also reinvigorated the oil and gas licensing process and agreed on a 2017 Budget, although this has not yet been approved by parliament. But repeated delays in the political process - the 2018 elections will be the first since 2009 and the new budget is the first state budget approved by a cabinet for 12 years - illustrate the constraints of Lebanon's sectarian political system, which have been made worse by the Syrian civil war. The new electoral law is unlikely to significantly change this system. Government formation after next year's election may once again be a drawn-out process. High and persistent political and security risks are reflected in Lebanon's low sovereign rating, affirmed at 'B-'/Stable in February 2017, alongside high public debt and anaemic economic growth. Political progress since November appears to have boosted the Lebanese diaspora's confidence in the country's economy. Deposit growth was 8.2% yoy in April 2017, sufficient to fund government borrowing, which depends on the channelling of deposits and remittances via the financial system, and ensure moderate credit growth to the private sector. Foreign-exchange deposits were 11% higher than a year earlier, and gross foreign-exchange reserves were 7.6% higher, although they had declined from February and March levels. Deposit growth may have been boosted by Aoun's election and the formation of a government, having dropped to less than 5% yoy for much of 1H16. However, reserves and deposits had also been boosted by a financial engineering operation by Banque du Liban (BdL), which sold eurobond holdings and foreign exchange-denominated certificates of deposit (CD), worth around USD13 billion to banks over several months last year. At the same time, BdL offered to discount at a premium equivalent amounts of Lebanese pound T-bills and CDs held by banks. The operation buoyed growth in non-resident deposits, as banks offered attractive conditions for foreign-exchange deposits to participate in BdL's operation. The risk is that as the effect of this operation wanes, deposit growth will again come under pressure. Recent political developments can help sustain positive sentiment, but rising public debt, up 8.6% yoy in March 2017, means that Lebanon remains vulnerable to a recurrence of political paralysis that dents confidence and deposit and remittance flows. Tougher US sanctions against Hizbollah could also directly or indirectly affect foreign flows into Lebanon and its banking sector, although these have not yet been formally proposed as a bill.

Muir, who had planned to compete in both the 1,500 meters and 5,000m, is set to concentrate on the shorter distance after withdrawing from next weekend's British trials in Birmingham. British Athletics performance director Neil Black said that 24-year-old Scot had  a one percent  chance of doubling up in London.  Her plan was to run at trials next weekend and with that not happening, that has changed things,  Black told the Times newspaper.  Laura had to have a period of time where she didn't run, that's over and she has now progressed her training up to almost normal level, so she has had to adapt.  Muir is one of Britain's leading medal prospects in London and was aiming to run in two events as she had at the European indoor championship in Belgrade earlier this year, where she won gold in the 1,500m and 3,000m. She is not expected to make her next competitive appearance until the Anniversary Games in London on July 9.

As the 22-year-old law student -- a member of a cultural club set up by secularists -- lay dying, the gunman waved his pistol threateningly before retreating outside. He then walked away without a word.  No group has claimed responsibility for the May 14 killing in broad daylight in the Sheikh Othman neighborhood, a brazen attack even for a city gripped by lawlessness more than two years into a civil war.  Friends suspect Abdulrahman was shot dead by Islamist militants who they say are waging a campaign of persecution against secularists accused of promoting an anti-Islam message or being atheists. Some residents fear the killing has taken the persecution to a new level, nearly two years after local fighters backed by a Saudi-led coalition drove Iran-aligned Houthi forces out of the southern city. Aden's governor, Abdulaziz al-Muflehi, chief of the local security forces and the city's police spokesman did not answer calls from Reuters to comment on the case.   But soldiers from a local security force comprising Salafist Islamists prevented the body being buried in the city cemetery.  They said he was not a Muslim,  said a friend of Abdulrahman who requested anonymity for fear of being targeted.  His family had to take him to another cemetery far away from the city,  she told Reuters. Cultural Club Yemen has been torn apart by the civil war pitting the Houthis against the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by the Saudi-led alliance.  Although secularists have complained of harassment elsewhere in the country, they have not previously reported that anyone has been killed over their secularist beliefs. Abdulrahman was a member a cultural club that was set up by secular students and intellectuals in 2016 and quickly came under pressure for broaching taboo subjects in public debates such as religion, women's rights and literature. A few weeks before he was killed in Sheikh Othman, a    lower middle-class residential area where low concrete buildings and houses flank dusty roads, Abdulrahman had helped moderate a debate hosted by the club known as al-Nassiya, on  the conditions of Adeni woman  in recent generations. The debates proved divisive in Aden, once the cosmopolitan capital of the Marxist People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, a country that merged with more traditional north Yemen in 1990.  The identity of the club's opponents are not obscure, but hardline anti-Western groups al Qaeda and Islamic State have taken advantage of the civil war to press their own agenda in southern Yemen.  Abdulrahman had been detained at a military base by a military commander and accused of being an atheist last December. He was freed days later, but friends say the incident convinced the family to suppress their grievances.  The family cannot even think about going to some kind of authority or seek justice for him,  Abdulrahman's friend said. Another member of the club, Mohammed Ali, said someone had also attempted to kill him on Dec. 29 last year. He now lives abroad.  It started when imams in Aden mosques talked about us publicly, called us infidels and accused us of spreading atheism,  said Ali. Others were jailed, according to a statement issued by the club after Abdulrahman's killing, and some residents fear  religious extremists have infiltrated the southern security forces to destabilize Aden. Ali said he had received threats via social media and phone calls after publishing a book on Islam and science, in which he sought to argue that some assertions in the Koran, the Muslim holy book, were  scientifically wrong .  In a dark street, a man came out of a car and shot at me twice,  said Ali.  I still don't know how he missed me.

Roche is counting on emicizumab to wrest a share of the $11 billion-a-year haemophilia drug market now dominated by traditional treatments from Novo Nordisk and Shire.  Nearly 63 percent of patients receiving emicizumab experienced zero treated bleeds, compared with 5.6 percent of those getting so-called bypassing agents, according to data released ahead of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) industry meeting in Berlin in July. Some analysts called Monday's data release convincing, with Jefferies saying it underpinned its $5 billion peak sales estimate for the medicine.  If full presentation of the data at the ISTH reassures on safety, our mid-term EPS estimates and valuation could increase by 2 percent to 4 percent,  Jefferies' Jeffrey Holford wrote in a note to investors. Haemophilia patients' blood does not clot properly, requiring life-saving infusions of clotting factors. Development of resistance, or inhibitors, in some patients can interfere with efforts to control bleeding, so Roche is hoping its drug, also known as ACE910, will offer a new avenue of treatment. Still, analysts continue to cite adverse events in Roche's studies including thrombotic microangiopathy -- damage to blood vessels in vital organs -- that accompanied repeated high doses of bypassing agents given to counter bleeds that occurred despite emicizumab treatment. Although Roche has played down emicizumab's role in the complications -- one death came after a patient refused a blood transfusion for religious reasons, it has said -- analysts' concerns linger. Roche shares rose 0.4 percent by 0930 GMT, while the Stoxx European health care sector index firmed 0.1 percent. Safety Perspective  From a safety perspective, treatment with this drug will require physicians to carefully manage the use of bypassing agents,  Bank Vontobel's Stefan Schneider wrote. That  could limit uptake , he said. Roche plans to file emicizumab with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year for approval for patients with inhibitors, with follow-on submissions in 2018 including for patients without resistance. Deutsche Bank analysts said Monday's data suggested it would be tough for emicizumab to make headway among those patients, however, since clotting factors appeared to be more effective for them.  Current therapy in the non-inhibitor setting provides a very high hurdle to new entrants and we believe emicizumab's less than perfect efficacy and observed thrombotic events will temper enthusiasm for the drug,  Deutsche Bank's Tim Race said.

Prosecutors have accused Shkreli of lying to investors in the hedge fund and siphoning millions of dollars in assets from biopharmaceutical company Retrophin Inc to repay them. He has pleaded not guilty. The trial, which will be heard by U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn, is expected to last four to six weeks. Shkreli, a boyish-looking 34, outraged patients and U.S. lawmakers by raising the price of anti-parisitic drug Daraprim to $750 a pill, from $13.50, in 2015, when he was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals. The charges that led to his arrest in December 2015 are not related to Turing but focus on Shkreli's management at Retrophin and the hedge fund MSMB Capital Management between 2009 and 2012. Prosecutors said Shkreli lied about MSMB's finances to lure investors and concealed devastating trading losses from them. They said he paid the investors back with money stolen from Retrophin, which he founded in 2011.

He has continued to court the public eye, especially through social media, sometimes complicating his defense. At a hearing last Monday, prosecutors refused to agree to Shkreli's request to reduce his bail by $3 million, which he said he needs to pay taxes and legal bills, pointing to his own public boasts about his wealth. Slideshow (2 Images)Since his arrest, Shkreli has flaunted purchases including a World War II-era Enigma code breaking machine, a Picasso painting and unreleased albums by Wu-Tang Clan and Lil Wayne. In April, he offered $40,000 to a Princeton University student who solved a mathematical proof. In May, he pledged on Facebook to pay $100,000 for tips leading to the arrest of the person who killed former Democratic National Committee employee Seth Rich. Shkreli was banned from Twitter in January for harassing a female journalist who wrote an op-ed piece for Teen Vogue criticizing President Donald Trump, whom Shkreli has supported. Shkreli's attention-seeking has at times exasperated his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, who urged Matsumoto last week not to give much weight to his client's  preposterous statements.

At the opening of the World Taekwondo Championships in Muju on Saturday, Moon said he wanted the Koreas to compete as one team next year and highlighted the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships as an example of a previous merger. However, North Korean International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Chang Ung ruled out the idea of a North-South team, telling the Dong-a Ilbo newspaper that it was an unrealistic aim in the present political climate.   It took us 22 rounds of talks to set up that joint (table tennis) team for the 1991 games. It took us five months,  Chang, who is leading the North Korea delegation at the Taekwondo event in a city two hours south of Seoul, told the paper.   That's the reality we face.  Chang also ruled out the possibility of using venues in the North to co-host the Feb. 9-25 Winter Games and dismissed the notion that a unified team would help improve ties by saying:  The Olympics should not be used for a political aim.

It's easy to talk about co-hosting, but it is never easy to solve practical problems for that. It's the same for forming a joint team for ice hockey,  Chang added. Moon, who was a senior official in the liberal former South Korean government of Roh Moo-hyun in the 2000s, took office on May 10, winning an election on a more moderate approach to North Korea and a promise to engage Pyongyang in dialogue. He believes engagement must be used as well as pressure to ease tensions between the rival states and convince the North to abandon its defiant nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. South Korea's sports officials said they remained receptive to the idea of competing together, however.  We are still open to possibilities about forming a joint team,  said Chun Byong-keuk, director general of Sports Corporation of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.

Fitch has assigned a rating of 'BB(EXP)'/'RR2' to Banijay's senior secured debt. Banijay has an experienced management team that has maintained cost discipline during the expansion of non-scripted content. Non-scripted content is exposed to shifts in consumer sentiment, but Banijay has demonstrated ability to adapt to these trends, including through customer diversification, with success in renewing shows for multiple seasons and in syndicating them to multiple countries. The expected rating is constrained by the company's high leverage, more limited size than its peers, and the low monetisation of its back catalogue through Banijay Rights. If Banijay continues to attract talented producers that understand the local market and to expand its geographic reach, its rating will benefit. The final ratings are contingent on the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS Leading Independent TV Producer: Banijay is the fourth-largest producer of TV content and the largest independent producer globally. The success of scripted dramas such as  Versailles  and the rapid growth of over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix is leading to additional content demand across the industry. However, the cost of production and the length of development mean there is limited ability to produce new scripted content. Banijay's focus on non-scripted content, which can be produced and delivered quickly. Greater Scale and Diversification: The recent acquisition of Zodiak has expanded the production of scripted shows.  Including the pending Castaway transaction, scale has improved significantly, with revenue and EBITDA more than doubling. The mergers have also enhanced Banijay's library in scripted and non-scripted content and added greater geographical diversification.  Banijay plans to increase scripted content to up to 20% of sales over the medium term.  This has the potential to increase the need for working capital as a scripted show can take up to two years to produce and some offsets, such as tax credits, are only received at the end of production. Consistent FCF Generation Despite Earn-Outs: Banijay's business is free cash flow (FCF) positive; capex is low due to its asset-light operating model. Fitch expects funds from operations (FFO) margins to fall to around 7% through the rating horizon from above 9% in 2016 due to higher interest expense following the refinancing. We forecast consistently positive FCF, which will be needed to finance over EUR100 million in earn-out payments in 2017 and 2018, but we expect cash balances to grow thereafter. Renewals Mitigate Business Cycle Risk: The risk of shows not being renewed and the potential for decreased demand among broadcast networks or OTTs due to the business cycle is mitigated by the success Banijay has had in renewing its existing shows and distributing them in additional geographies. The development of Banijay Rights after the Zodiak acquisition should improve the company's ability to monetise its back catalogue and further enhance revenue visibility. Above-Average Recoveries: Fitch uses a bespoke recovery approach for credits whose IDR is 'B+' or below. For Banijay, Fitch uses a going-concern approach where it assumes post-restructuring EBITDA is 25% below its 2017 forecast EBITDA, a 5.5x distressed multiple, and 10% of going-concern enterprise value is deducted for administrative claims.  Fitch also assumes that the revolving credit facility (RCF), term loan and senior secured note are pari passu and that the RCF would be fully drawn upon default.  Fitch therefore assigns a Recovery Rating of 'RR2' to the senior secured debt with recoveries between 70% and 90%. DERIVATION SUMMARY Banijay is the leading independent TV production studio and the fourth largest globally. Its primary competitors are EndemolShine Group, ITV Studios, FremantleMedia and All3Media.  It has a greater proportion of unscripted content than its peers, although the acquisition of Zodiak increases its exposure to scripted content. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - revenue growth trending towards 6% in 2019; - EBITDA margin stable at 11.5%; - increased demand for working capital due to the shift towards producing scripted content; - over EUR100 million in payments for earn-outs and put options between 2017 and 2019. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -FFO net adjusted leverage trending below 4x -FFO fixed charge coverage above 3.5x -Increased scale with sales above EUR1 billion, improved mix between non-scripted and scripted content and further development of the digital strategy -Successful development of the Banijay Rights business and expansion into additional geographies Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -FFO net adjusted leverage trending above 5x -FFO fixed charge coverage below 3x -Inability to turn around the businesses in Spain and Germany -Failure to renew leading shows and delays in the development of the digital strategy LIQUIDITY Satisfactory Liquidity: Banijay has comfortable liquidity, with EUR73 million in cash on balance sheet for 2016, consistently positive FCF, a EUR35 million RCF once the transaction is completed and modest working-capital swings.  Fitch believes that the transition to a greater proportion of scripted content will increase the need for working capital, but Banijay's liquidity is sufficient to meet those needs.

The listing is expected to take place in mid July and will follow those of pizza chain Vapiano and online takeaway food delivery group Delivery Hero. The private placement will comprise new shares from a capital increase worth around 130 million euros ($145.5 million), as well as stock held by existing shareholders including buyout group Cinven. The listing is expected to value the company at about 700 million euros ($783 million) including its 260 million euros in net debt, and more than 100 million of the proceeds will be used to pay down debt, people close to the matter said. Sources had told Reuters last month that Cinven was reviving plans to list Jost, having previously shelved plans for a flotation due to wobbly capital markets. A listing would prove a positive turn for Cinven, which acquired a majority stake in Jost just weeks before the Lehman insolvency in 2008 and had to agree to a restructuring of the group's finances in 2010 to avert looming insolvency. Cinven saw its stake in the company cut to 64 percent, while Jost's management retained a holding of more than 23 percent. Junior debt holders converted their claims into preferred shares, giving them a 13 percent stake. Since then, Jost has acquired the Mercedes-Benz TrailerAxleSystems business from Daimler and boosted its profitable after market business. In 2016, Jost posted adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of 78 million euros on sales of 634 million. Listed truck parts maker SAF Holland trades at about 7.7 times its expected core earnings, a valuation Jost is hoping to top given its strong margins. In the first quarter of 2017, its best ever, Jost posted an EBIT margin of 12.4 percent compared to 8.7 at SAF Holland. Founded in 1952, Jost is the market leader for automotive landing gears and fifth wheels sold under brands such as Jost, Rockinger, Edbro and Tridec.

This sharp depreciation, which lacks any fundamental drivers on a relatively quiet trading day has left investors bewildered,  said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst, FXTM.       With the fundamentals out of the picture, price action may be the key culprit behind the decline,  he added.             Spot gold        was down 1.2 percent at $1,241.89 per ounce, as of 0912 GMT, touching its lowest since May 17.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery slipped 1.1 percent to $1,243.10 per ounce.      The market remains clueless about this trigger. The sweep went through CME, 18,500 lots gold and 5,500 lots silver,  said  Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS in Switzerland.       A few centres in the Middle East and Far East are closed for the Eid festivities, so the market is thin.         Investors are settling into a cautious mode while they await the U.S. data, including June consumer confidence, pending home sales, crude oil inventories and revised first-quarter GDP for signs of softness that could push back rate hike expectations.      There's certainly some expectations of disappointing data and also a more dovish Fed, that could keep gold prices elevated,  ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said.  Anything on the inflation front will be constantly watched.          Shares rose in Europe on Monday, with Italian banks gaining after a deal to wind up two failed regional lenders, while the dollar and U.S. bond yields held close to recent lows as subdued inflation raised questions over the outlook for monetary policy.                      I think there's a chance for a potential delay in rate hikes, which would support gold prices further,  Hynes said.     Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.      Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dipped 0.35 percent to 851.02 tonnes on Friday.               Hedge funds and money managers slashed their net long position in COMEX gold for the second straight week in the week to June 20, and cut it slightly in silver, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.                  Among other precious metals, silver        dropped as much as 1.4 percent to $16.46 per ounce. Platinum        slipped up to 0.6 percent to $920.40 per ounce.      Palladium        gained 0.3 percent to $854.25 per ounce. In the previous session, it registered its biggest intraday percentage decline since Jan. 25.

At the opening of the World Taekwondo Championships in Muju on Saturday, Moon said he wanted the Koreas to compete as one team next year and highlighted the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships as an example of a previous merger. However, North Korean International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Chang Ung ruled out the idea of a North-South team, telling the Dong-a Ilbo newspaper that it was an unrealistic aim in the present political climate.   It took us 22 rounds of talks to set up that joint (table tennis) team for the 1991 games. It took us five months,  Chang, who is leading the North Korea delegation at the Taekwondo event in a city two hours south of Seoul, told the paper.   That's the reality we face.  Chang also ruled out the possibility of using venues in the North to co-host the Feb. 9-25 Winter Games and dismissed the notion that a unified team would help improve ties by saying:  The Olympics should not be used for a political aim.

It's easy to talk about co-hosting, but it is never easy to solve practical problems for that. It's the same for forming a joint team for ice hockey,  Chang added. Moon, who was a senior official in the liberal former South Korean government of Roh Moo-hyun in the 2000s, took office on May 10, winning an election on a more moderate approach to North Korea and a promise to engage Pyongyang in dialogue. He believes engagement must be used as well as pressure to ease tensions between the rival states and convince the North to abandon its defiant nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. South Korea's sports officials said they remained receptive to the idea of competing together, however.  We are still open to possibilities about forming a joint team,  said Chun Byong-keuk, director general of Sports Corporation of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. South Korean Sports Minister Do Jong-hwan said last week that he would hold talks with the IOC about forming a joint female ice hockey team for the 2018 Olympics.

The agency raised Greece's long-term issuer rating to 'Caa2' from 'Caa3' after euro zone governments extended a credit lifeline. It also changed the outlook to positive from stable.  There was some speculation about a rating upgrade, but what was really a surprise was that positive outlook, giving a chance for another upgrade,  said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz. The benchmark 10-year yield fell 8 basis points to 5.42 percent, its lowest since December 2009. Sources told Reuters earlier this month that Greece would return to the bond market if the level dropped below 5 percent. Two-year Greek yields were at their lowest since 2010. Moody's cited the successful conclusion of bailout talks between Greece and the European Union, an improved fiscal performance and tentative signs of the economy stabilising as reasons for the upgrade. The decision to assign a positive outlook was made on better prospects for a successful conclusion of Greece's third bailout, which in turn raised the likelihood of debt relief.  Later repayment to official creditors would improve Greece's capacity to service debt held by private sector investors, to which Moody's ratings speak,  the agency said in a note.

Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has been feuding bitterly with its Japanese partner over the $18 billion sale and has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent.  I must make it clear that Western Digital will not consent to a transaction with the proposed consortium,  CEO Stephen Milligan said in a letter sent to Toshiba's board. The June 25 letter, seen by Reuters on Monday, said that SK Hynix's participation in a consortium purchasing Toshiba's interests in their joint ventures  increases the likelihood of technology leakage and harm to the JVs going forward.  Toshiba last week chose a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors as preferred bidder for the unit, the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash chips. The South Korean chipmaker, which is relatively weak in NAND flash memory chips, will provide half of the 850 billion yen ($7.6 billion) that Bain plans to put up in the form of financing, sources have said. Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference on Friday that SK Hynix would not be holding any equity and would not be involved in management - an arrangement that was unlikely to raise regulatory red flags and would prevent leaks of key technology information.

L'indice du moral des entrepreneurs de l'institut munichois Ifo, publié lundi et calculé à partir d'un échantillon de quelque 7.000 entreprises, a monté à 115,1 en juin contre 114,6, un chiffre confirmé, en mai. Les économistes interrogés par Reuters l'attendaient à 114,4.  Le sentiment au sein des entreprises allemandes est jubilatoire , a dit l'économiste en chef de l'Ifo, Clemens Füst, dans un communiqué.  Les entreprises sont significativement plus satisfaites de leur situation actuelle ce mois-ci. Elles s'attendent aussi à une amélioration de leur activité. L'économie allemande enregistre d'excellents résultats.  La demande privée est un moteur déterminant pour l'économie et il y encore des marges de progression à l'export, a dit Klaus Wohlrabe, économiste de l'Ifo, à Reuters. La croissance de l'économie allemande a accéléré à 0,6% au premier trimestre par rapport au trimestre précédent et Wohlrabe a dit s'attendre à une nouvelle amélioration à +0,7% au deuxième trimestre. Ni la perspective de la sortie de la Grande-Bretagne de l'Union européenne, ni l'approche des élections législatives allemandes du mois de septembre n'ont affecté l'optimisme des chefs d'entreprise, a-t-il dit, tout en prévenant que le scrutin pourrait avoir un impact au mois d'août. Pour Andreas Scheuerle, économiste de DekaBank, les chefs d'entreprise allemands deviennent peut-être un peu trop euphoriques.  Même au premier trimestre, le climat des affaires (...) est bien trop optimiste par rapport aux évolutions de l'économie réelle. Au deuxième trimestre, cette tendance s'est encore renforcée , a-t-il dit.  Cela se corrigera à un certain moment, mais alors il ne faudra pas faire l'erreur d'interpréter cela comme l'annonce de la prochaine récession . Les évaluations que les chefs d'entreprises font de leur situation actuelle et de leurs perspectives à six mois ont progressé en juin. Les sous-indices les mesurant sont ressortis respectivement à 124,1 (consensus: 123,3) et à 106,8 (consensus: 106,4). La Bundesbank et les principaux instituts de conjoncture allemands ont relevé leurs prévisions de croissance de l'économie allemande pour cette année et pour 2018, soulignant un mouvement de reprise auto-entretenu et alimenté par une demande intérieure dynamique. Le gouvernement s'en tient toutefois à sa prévision prudente d'une croissance de 1,5% cette année et de 1,6% l'année prochaine, que la ministre de l'Economie Brigitte Zypries, a encore confirmée le 16 juin dans un entretien à Reuters.

More than 118 people were injured in the explosion in the eastern province of Punjab, which came as people gathered to collect leaking fuel after the tanker overturned on Sunday, government officials and rescue workers said. The disaster was one of several deadly events to mar the run-up to Monday's Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. At least 65 people were killed in bombings in two cities on Friday claimed by Islamist militants including the Pakistani Taliban and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. A burst tyre apparently caused the speeding fuel tanker to overturn on a sharp bend on a highway on the outskirts of the city of Bahawalpur, provincial spokesman Malik Muhammed Ahmed Khan said. It was not clear what triggered the fireball but on Sunday, a spokesman for rescue services said someone was believed to have lit a cigarette.  Rehabilitation and treatment of the victims is our top priority,  Khan said. Hospitals are also arranging DNA testing to identify the many bodies that were charred beyond recognition. At least 20 children are among the dead.

Governments hospital are often-underequipped and the ones in Bahawalpur and nearby Multan were set up only to handle small numbers, Khan said. The oil tanker driver, who survived, has been detained to assist in an investigation, but early reports do not indicate human error, Khan said.

Police did try but we are looking into what went wrong,  he said. Prime Minister Sharif visited the injured in Bahawalpur's Victoria Hospital on Sunday after flying home from a trip to London, his office said. Television footage showed the prime minister standing by the bedsides of victims. Sharif had been in London to attend his grandson's graduation ceremony, his daughter Maryam said in a tweet.

Poland's index led gains, trading 1.2 percent higher at 0809 GMT. The country's second-largest lender Bank Pekao SA jumped 3 percent, while mBank surged 2.4 percent.      Traders said this was due to JP Morgan raising the target price for Pekao, and putting it to  overweight  from  underweight .     The ruling party in Romania is expected to propose a new prime minister to President Klaus Iohannis, a centrist, on Monday to replace Grindeanu who was ousted last week in a no-confidence vote initiated by his own party.     Once Iohannis endorses the candidate, a new government could be formed within days. The political uncertainty follows jitters over the government's loose fiscal policies, but it was not expected to have a major impact on policy.      In our view, changing a prime minister will not entangle any major shifts in the current government policies except from the possibility of deviating further away from the anti-corruption path than under Grindeanu's leadership,  analysts at Nordea bank said in a note.      Regardless of who will be the new Romanian PM, the political and fiscal risks will remain in place with the government policies continuing to be quite hasty and sometimes unpredictable ... we are not too optimistic about the RON in the medium-term,  they added.     The leu was steady at around 4.57 to the euro but was still hovering around its weakest levels since 2012 of 4.599 hit last week.      A possibly fast implementation of a new government... and the resolving of the political uncertainty could in our view induce a quick return of EUR/RON into the 4.50-4.55 range,  Raiffeisen analysts said.     The Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty  were both 0.1 percent firmer in early, slow trade.

The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 115.1 from 114.6 in May. The reading compared with a Reuters consensus forecast of 114.4.  Sentiment among German businesses is jubilant,  Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said in a statement.  Companies were significantly more satisfied with their current business situation this month. They also expect business to improve. Germany's economy is performing very strongly.  Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said neither the prospect of Britain's departure from the European Union nor the countdown to federal elections in September had affected business morale, though the election could have an impact in August. Private consumption was a key growth driver and there was still room for expansion in exports, he told Reuters. Growth in the economy, Europe's largest, accelerated to 0.6 percent quarter on quarter in the first three months of 2017. Wohlrabe expected 0.7 percent in the second quarter. Andreas Scheuerle, economist at DekaBank, said some German business executives were at risk of getting carried away.  Even in the first quarter, business sentiment ... was much too optimistic compared to actual developments. In the second quarter, this trend was further strengthened,  he said.  This will correct at some point, but then we should not make the mistake of interpreting this as the way to the next recession.  Germany's central bank and leading economic institutes have raised their estimates for German gross domestic product (GDP)growth for this year and next, pointing to a broad-based and self-reinforcing upswing propelled by vibrant domestic demand. The Bundesbank raised its growth forecasts this month. But the government is sticking to its cautious outlook for GDP growth of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018, Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries told Reuters after the Bundesbank's revision.

The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 115.1 from 114.6 in May. The reading compared with a Reuters consensus forecast of 114.4.  Sentiment among German businesses is jubilant,  Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said in a statement.  Companies were significantly more satisfied with their current business situation this month. They also expect business to improve. Germany's economy is performing very strongly.  Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said neither the prospect of Britain's departure from the European Union nor the countdown to federal elections in September had affected business morale, though the election could have an impact in August. Private consumption was a key growth driver and there was still room for expansion in exports, he told Reuters. Growth in the economy, Europe's largest, accelerated to 0.6 percent quarter on quarter in the first three months of 2017. Wohlrabe expected 0.7 percent in the second quarter. Andreas Scheuerle, economist at DekaBank, said some German business executives were at risk of getting carried away.  Even in the first quarter, business sentiment ... was much too optimistic compared to actual developments. In the second quarter, this trend was further strengthened,  he said.  This will correct at some point, but then we should not make the mistake of interpreting this as the way to the next recession.  Germany's central bank and leading economic institutes have raised their estimates for German gross domestic product (GDP)growth for this year and next, pointing to a broad-based and self-reinforcing upswing propelled by vibrant domestic demand. The Bundesbank raised its growth forecasts this month. But the government is sticking to its cautious outlook for GDP growth of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018, Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries told Reuters after the Bundesbank's revision.

MSCI's emerging markets benchmark rose 0.6 percent, lifted by Asia where Taiwan closed at 27-year highs and Hong Kong-listed Chinese shares rose 0.75 percent. Chinese Shanghai- and Shenzen-listed shares were at 18-month highs  after MSCI said it could add another 195 firms to its emerging markets index having this month given the green light to 222 stocks to join in a year's time. On currency markets, the dollar remained pinned flat as markets have been pricing out another U.S. rate rise this year, given the run of soft economic data while the U.S. bond curve is at the flattest in a decade, with 10-year yields just off seven-month lows.  People are still happy to buy EM assets and high yielders. We have well digested the Fed. Maybe there could be a question about inflation this week - we expect a decline in both Europe and the United States,  said Guillaume Tresca, a strategist at Credit Agricole in Paris.  We are trying to find a trigger for a sell off – such as bad inflation, the ECB, political risk - but all these factors are okay for now.  That backdrop has allowed emerging currencies to rally, with currencies ranging from the Korean won to the South African rand and the Turkish lira rising around 0.4 percent to the dollar . The rouble jumped 0.8 percent, rising off four-month lows hit during last week's oil price fall. Gulf markets were shut for Eid but Qatari credit default swaps rose 4 basis points to the highest in a year after neighbouring states, which have imposed sanctions on the country, gave it 10 days to comply with an ultimatum. Although world markets have remained sanguine, Morgan Stanley pointed out the possible fallout on oil prices.  The Saudi Arabia-led group seems to have adopted an increasingly critical position against Iran which may soon lead to uncertainty about the size of regional energy exports should the conflict escalate further from here,  the bank wrote. Political risk may also flare in South Africa where investors are concerned about the threat to central bank independence.  In the very short-term we are still positive on the rand, due to the carry. But we see a long-term depreciation due to the high political risk,  Tresca said.  The central bank has always been a positive factor for ratings agencies and investors.

Some lenders are worried about a squeeze on their profit margin, but the number of them has fallen since the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the 184 mortgage executives who responded to the survey. In a response to a tougher climate, more lenders said they plan to relax their lending standards, which could attract more borrowers, survey data showed. “Expectations to ease credit standards climbed to survey highpoints in the second quarter as more lenders reported slowing mortgage demand and increasing concerns about competition from other lenders,” Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae's chief economist at Washington-based mortgage finance agency, said in a statement. The margin on the share of lenders who saw a drop in consumer demand for a loan to buy a home in the past three months over the share of lenders who saw a rise in purchase loan demand fell to about 30 percent, the lowest in two years on a year-over-year basis, Fannie Mae said. The net percentage of lenders which anticipate lower profit margin in the next three months stood at 6 points, down from 12 points in the first quarter and from 31 points in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net share of lenders which expect to ease credit standards rose to 15 points in the second quarter, up from about 3.5 points a year earlier. Fannie Mae's quarterly lender sentiment survey was launched in March 2014.

The U.S. chipmaker subsequently challenged the decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second highest. Judges rejected its arguments in 2014, saying the Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel's 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent.

While China's large and state-backed entities maintain access to cash, smaller firms say they are finding it tougher to get loans from state-owned banks, forcing them to think twice about investments and, for some, seek costlier alternatives. In January 2016, short-term bank loans - usually up to one-year - to corporate customers made up China's fastest growing lending segment to non-financial borrowers at 4.8 percent year-on-year, data from Moody's Investors Service and the People's Bank of China showed. That segment is now registering the slowest growth in the same category of lending, at less than one percent in March this year, the data showed. For managers like Davis Cai in China's manufacturing heartland along the Pearl River, the squeeze not only means his masonry company Shenzhen Leeste Industry has to be careful managing its cash, but more and more of its customers are struggling, threatening a vicious cycle of non-payment.  We are afraid to do big projects because of this, we are only doing some small projects instead,  Cai, the firm's export manager, told Reuters.  If there aren’t any changes, it will be really difficult for us.  The company, whose product line includes statues of angels, Catholic saints and Buddhas for high-end developments, counts the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver, Canada, and the Doha Metro in Qatar as past projects, as well as Harbin Pharmaceutical's Renaissance-style offices in northern China. The company has had to resort to borrowing from private lenders, often through middlemen introduced through friends and contacts, paying rates at least  twice or three times higher  than regular banks, he said.  The pressure is very great ... We need to borrow from these people,  he said. Stephen Chow, a sales manager at Guangzhou Provision Electronics Co. Ltd, which designs and manufactures electronic displays, said that while his company has been able to borrow, the bar at state-run banks has been raised in recent years.  It usually takes a longer timeframe to borrow money from state-owned banks, around 60 days to 90 days. They have to get approval from people with higher authority, so it takes a longer time,  Chow said.  We are being more careful with our investment.  Old Pain Borrowing pain is not new to corporate China. Policymakers last year focused on  supply-side reform , aiming to cut debt in sectors with excess capacity, such as iron and coal production, leading to a spate of bond defaults. But while tighter credit may help bolster corporate China's overall creditworthiness and remove surplus capacity, it also drives financing activity elsewhere, to non-traditional lenders and other parts of the capital markets. Meanwhile, investors are increasingly demanding greater yield for riskier debt assets. Bond yields for top-rated issuers are up about 75 percent from their 2016 trough in October. The additional yield that investors demand on lower-rated borrowers has more than doubled since the end of last year to about 36 basis points late last week. Syndicated offshore loan volumes to Chinese companies have also fallen in the first four months of this year to less than a third of what they were in same period last year. Issuance of perpetual bonds, which do not have a maturity date, has soared this year. The increase has raised concerns that the true debt position of some corporations is being concealed because perpetual bonds are considered equity, not debt, for accounting purposes. For policymakers, tighter credit conditions are exactly what the doctor ordered.  In China it is the availability of credit rather than its cost that matters more ... at the end of the day, they have to pass it on (to customers),  said Sean Darby, strategist with Jefferies. At the same time, Darby said,  they allow a lot of companies to service their debt pretty much without pushing them into insolvency.  Analysts and even many business leaders agree regulators' efforts to limit the availability of credit to riskier borrowers will improve China's corporate health and remove questionable investment practices.  As long as you have collateral and good standing, I don't think it is difficult to get corporate financing,  said Huang Yongpeng, president of the Dalang Federation of Industry and Commerce in the Pearl River Delta region of Dongguan. But for Foshan Junjing Industrial, a tile and ceramics manufacturer in Guangdong, the squeeze and softer economic conditions more generally mean a slower pace of expansion.  We are trying to focus on providing services instead of investment,  said Foshan's sales department manager, Johnny Lee.

Sunday's explosive Azerbaijan Grand Prix more than made up for last year's dull race in Baku, bursting the budding 'bromance' and replacing it with something much more heavyweight. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said as much after a crazy  afternoon that saw mutual respect and camaraderie tossed aside amid angry accusations.  Nobody wanted to see the schmoozing anyway, so now the gloves are off,  the Austrian told Sky Sports television after Hamilton had dubbed the Ferrari driver a  disgrace  and suggested they sort things out  face to face .  The sport needs the rivalry. What we have seen today is the ingredient of a great championship,  said Wolff. The most memorable seasons have been fueled by controversy, passion and a fierce rivalry sometimes spilling into outright enmity. Baku, with the championship favorites colliding and a podium of drivers who could scarcely believe their luck, provided enough drama to keep the championship bubbling away for months to come. In Spain last May, Hamilton had spoken about how enjoyable it was to be battling a rival who was not a team mate -- his main opponent for the past three seasons -- and the admiration he felt for Vettel's speed and consistency. The Briton had warned then, however, that it might not last and on Sunday he was proven right. Battle Lines The battle lines were drawn the moment Vettel went into the back of Hamilton's Mercedes during the second of three safety car periods, the German shaking his fists and pulling alongside to bang wheels in a gesture that looked a lot like 'road rage'. The frustrated and angry man of 2016, who raged at rivals and had to apologize to race director Charlie Whiting in Mexico last November after an expletive-laden radio rant, was back. The stewards were clear in apportioning blame, imposing a 10 second stop-and-go penalty on the German for steering into Hamilton. The championship leader, now 14 points clear of Hamilton after finishing fourth to the Briton's fifth, was also given  three penalty points which could prove significant. They bring Vettel's tally in the last 12 months to nine and means another such sanction in Austria in two weeks' time would trigger an automatic race ban for the following round at Silverstone. There were some who felt such a penalty should have been applied already, even if the moment of madness ultimately cost Vettel a victory that would have fallen into his lap after Hamilton had to pit to fix a loose head rest.  Deliberately driving into another driver and getting away pretty much scot-free as he still came fourth, I think that's a disgrace. I think he disgraced himself today,  said triple champion Hamilton.  Imagine all the young kids that are watching Formula One today and see that kind of behavior from a four-time world champion. I think that says it all.  Vettel's assertion that Hamilton had 'brake-tested' him, by  slowing so suddenly that the Ferrari ran into the back of the Mercedes, was also undermined by the evidence. The governing FIA confirmed that Hamilton's car data showed he  maintained a consistent speed and behaved in the same manner on that occasion as in all the other re-starts during the race . Mercedes non-executive director and retired triple champion Niki Lauda said he had never seen anything like it.  Vettel is a decent guy normally. This I don't understand. He is crazy. Lewis will hit him one day. Not with the car but with his fist,  he said. Editing by John O'Brien","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-f1-azerbaijan-idUSKBN19H0UI"},

Potential buyers included offshore entities, administrator Mark Korda of KordaMentha told reporters after a creditors meeting on Monday, although he declined to name interested parties. News Corp NSWA.O Co-Chairman Lachlan Murdoch, regional TV boss Bruce Gordon and Crown Resorts' (CWN.AX) James Packer own a combined 29.7 percent of the struggling free-to-air broadcaster and their support is essential if it is to survive a savage audience downturn which has hammered advertising sales. While administrators were called in this month after Murdoch and Gordon declined to extend support for a A$200 million ($152 million) debt facility past 2017, the move was widely seen as a necessary step to help it re-negotiate costly content licensing fees with U.S. production studios. The three tycoons now plan to put a financing facility in place to ensure that Ten has sufficient cash to continue to operate, Korda said.  It will be all three at the present time, and the limit is just being worked on at the moment,  he added. Mark Korda, lead administrator for Australia's third-largest free-to-air television network, Network 10, speaks during a press conference after administrators held the first meeting for creditors of the media company in Sydney, Australia, June 26, 2017.Jason ReedMurdoch and Gordon also said earlier this month that they had formed an agreement to restructure Ten. Australia's broadcasters, and perpetual ratings laggard Ten in particular, have suffered large losses as advertisers follow viewers onto streaming services like Netflix (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Amazon Prime. Slideshow (5 Images)Ten shares have been suspended from trading since the company called in administrators on June 14. The company had a market capitalization of A$58 million at its last traded price, a fraction of its value a few years earlier. The Australian Senate will debate a government bill later this year aimed at making it easier for media companies to buy each other. Under current laws, Murdoch and Gordon would likely face regulatory hurdles if they tried to buy Ten because they own other media assets.  On Monday, Korda said Ten can continue as a viable company regardless of how the country's parliament votes on relaxing media ownership laws.

The Co-op Bank, which provides banking services to almost 4 million retail and small and medium sized enterprises, said it was in advanced talks with a group of existing investors over a deal which includes a recapitalization. A deal would allow the bank to meet the longer term capital requirements demanded by the regulator and to continue as a stand-alone entity, while safeguarding its values and ethics, it said in a statement. The bank, which put itself up for sale in February, nearly collapsed in 2013 after losses from problem real estate loans and has been struggling to rebuild its financial health. Co-op said it was discussing its capital raising options with the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority. A majority of the key commercial aspects of the deal had been  substantially agreed , it said, and it was in advanced talks over how to manage the group's pension liabilities, it said in response to media reports of an impending deal.  Discussions are continuing between the parties, including on other key matters, with a view to agreeing the final aspects of the Proposal and a further announcement will be made in due course,  it said. As a result, the Co-op said it had decided to discontinue a formal sale process.

Potential buyers included offshore entities, administrator Mark Korda of KordaMentha told reporters after a creditors meeting on Monday, although he declined to name interested parties. News Corp NSWA.O Co-Chairman Lachlan Murdoch, regional TV boss Bruce Gordon and Crown Resorts' (CWN.AX) James Packer own a combined 29.7 percent of the struggling free-to-air broadcaster and their support is essential if it is to survive a savage audience downturn which has hammered advertising sales. While administrators were called in this month after Murdoch and Gordon declined to extend support for a A$200 million ($152 million) debt facility past 2017, the move was widely seen as a necessary step to help it re-negotiate costly content licensing fees with U.S. production studios. The three tycoons now plan to put a financing facility in place to ensure that Ten has sufficient cash to continue to operate, Korda said.  It will be all three at the present time, and the limit is just being worked on at the moment,  he added. Mark Korda, lead administrator for Australia's third-largest free-to-air television network, Network 10, speaks during a press conference after administrators held the first meeting for creditors of the media company in Sydney, Australia, June 26, 2017.Jason ReedMurdoch and Gordon also said earlier this month that they had formed an agreement to restructure Ten. Australia's broadcasters, and perpetual ratings laggard Ten in particular, have suffered large losses as advertisers follow viewers onto streaming services like Netflix (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Amazon Prime. Slideshow (5 Images)Ten shares have been suspended from trading since the company called in administrators on June 14. The company had a market capitalization of A$58 million at its last traded price, a fraction of its value a few years earlier. The Australian Senate will debate a government bill later this year aimed at making it easier for media companies to buy each other. Under current laws, Murdoch and Gordon would likely face regulatory hurdles if they tried to buy Ten because they own other media assets.  On Monday, Korda said Ten can continue as a viable company regardless of how the country's parliament votes on relaxing media ownership laws.

A deal would allow the bank to meet the longer term capital requirements demanded by the regulator and to continue as a stand-alone entity, while safeguarding its values and ethics, it said in a statement. The bank, which put itself up for sale in February, nearly collapsed in 2013 after losses from problem real estate loans and has been struggling to rebuild its financial health. Co-op said it was discussing its capital raising options with the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority. A majority of the key commercial aspects of the deal had been  substantially agreed , it said, and it was in advanced talks over how to manage the group's pension liabilities, it said in response to media reports of an impending deal.  Discussions are continuing between the parties, including on other key matters, with a view to agreeing the final aspects of the Proposal and a further announcement will be made in due course,  it said. As a result, the Co-op said it had decided to discontinue a formal sale process.  Financial support for the bank's portion of Co-operative Group's 10 billion pound pension scheme has been one of the sticking points of the deal. Co-operative Group currently has a 20 percent stake in the bank. However, the positions of the bank's investors and the pension scheme trustees on the issue were now  largely aligned , a source familiar with the matter said.

The southern African nation has since 2001 relied on imports and foreign donors to meet demand for the staple maize. Drought, lack of financing and President Robert Mugabe's seizures of land from white farmers that hit commercial agriculture have been blamed for low grain production over the years. The Herald newspaper reported that the government and local energy company Sakunda Holdings had signed an agreement that would see three banks provide the capital to mainly fund production of maize and soya. Sakunda, which imports and distributes fuel, runs a logistics business and operates a 200 megawatt diesel power plant, will work with CBZ bank, Barclays and the local unit of Ecobank to provide the money. The newspaper did not give details on the funding. CBZ Chief Executive Never Nyemudzo and Sakunda boss Kudakwashe Tagwirei did not answer their mobile phones when contacted. Officials from Barclays and Ecobank could not be reached for comment. After a devastating drought last year, Zimbabwe received above normal rains during the 2016/17 farming season and expects to produce 2.1 million tonnes of maize, its highest since 1996, according to official figures. The Herald said the government would start delivering seed, fertiliser and crop chemicals to farmers around the country between July and September, ahead of the planting season that begins in November. Farmers would be required to sell their crop to the state grain agency as repayment. Nearly 70 percent of Zimbabwe's population is rural and survives on agriculture.

Investors have upped their expectations for a hike to record low interest rates in Britain after more BoE policymakers voted towards one at the bank's last policy meeting. Its chief economist said last week that he expected to vote for a hike later this year. That has caused the pound to recover part of its losses since May's gamble on a snap election backfired to produce no clear majority for any party. The leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Arlene Foster, will meet May at 0930 GMT on Monday for talks on propping up her government, a DUP spokesman said. Foster said on Sunday she was close to finalising a deal with May's Conservative Party. By 0738 GMT, the pound was up 0.2 percent at $1.2748. It was 0.2 percent higher at 87.86 pence per euro. Investors were also digesting headlines over the weekend surrounding Britain's exit from the European Union. Brexit minister David Davis said on Sunday he was  pretty sure  he could negotiate a good deal to leave the EU, something that would require a transitional arrangement for around one or two years. Davis also told members of the Conservative Party to stop being  self-indulgent  after the Sunday Times newspaper reported that leading members of the party want finance minister Philip Hammond to become prime minister in place of May to steer the country through the Brexit process. Analysts at LMAX flagged political uncertainty over Britain's government and Brexit as reasons for being cautious on the pound.  With the government still scrambling and the Brexit negotiations hanging in the balance, there is plenty of good reason to not be getting overly bullish the pound just yet,  they wrote.

The BIS, an umbrella body for leading central banks, said in one of its most upbeat annual reports for years that global growth could soon be back at long-term average levels after a sharp improvement in sentiment over the past year. Though pockets of risk remain because of high debt levels, low productivity growth and dwindling policy firepower, the BIS said policymakers should take advantage of the improving economic outlook and its surprisingly negligible effect on inflation to accelerate the  great unwinding  of quantitative easing programmes and record low interest rates. New technologies and working practices are likely to be playing a roll in suppressing inflation, it said, though normal impulses should kick in if unemployment continues to drop.  Since we are now emerging from a very long period of very accommodative monetary policy, whatever we do, we will have to do it in a very careful way,  BIS's head of research, Hyun Song Shin, told Reuters.  Stay the Course   If we leave it too late, it is going to be much more difficult to accomplish that unwinding. Even if there are some short-term bumps in the road it would be much more advisable to stay the course and begin that process of normalisation.  Shin added that it will be  very difficult, if not impossible  to remove all those bumps. Good communication from central bankers will be important, but even more crucial is the need for banks to be strong enough to cope with any turbulence. The BIS identified four main risks to the global outlook in the medium-term. A sudden flare-up of inflation which forces up interest rates and hurts growth, financial stress linked to the contraction phase of financial cycles, a rise in protectionism and weaker consumption not offset by stronger investment. The first seems unlikely for now at least, with Shin saying that the BIS, like many, had been surprised that inflation and wage growth has remained so subdued as growth in major economies has picked up. The question for central bankers, therefore, is whether new technologies and working practices had fundamentally changed the inputs in their economic models and whether it is right to keep such a heavy focus on keeping inflation at certain levels -- near 2 percent for likes of the European Central Bank and U.S. Federal Reserve.  Inflation is certainly not the only variable that matters ... and we should keep one eye at least on financial developments,  Shin said. A broadening away from inflation-targeting to financial market conditions would require a mindset change in large parts of the world and could speed up interest rate cycles. When the U.S. Federal Reserve last embarked on rate increases more than a decade ago, it took two years to raise them from 1 percent to above 5 percent, with hikes at 17 consecutive meetings. In the current cycle, it has taken 18 months for a 1 percentage point increase. Protectionism The BIS report added that the lack of clarity over inflation also makes it far harder to judge how far rates could go up before they start coming down again.  In practice, therefore, central banks have little alternative but to move without a firm end-point in mind,  it said. The report also touched on another current global theme -- protectionism, potentially one of the most damaging of the four main risks it identified. One piece of research based on the U.S. transport industry estimated that if 10 percent tariffs were put on imports from Mexico or China, U.S. labour costs would have to drop by about 6 percent to compensate for the higher costs of  imported inputs . For some of the largest emerging markets there were also concerns about dollar debt and protracted credit expansion, often alongside rising property prices, storing up risks. Low interest rates, though, have generally kept debt-service ratios below critical thresholds.  The policy challenge is to take advantage of the current tailwinds to put the expansion on a sounder footing,  said Claudio Borio, head of the BIS monetary and economic department.  First and foremost, that requires building resilience, domestically and globally.  The BIS’s financial results, which were also published on Sunday, showed the Swiss-based bank had made a net profit $1.124 billion over the year to March 31 and had a balance sheet worth $329 billion.

It has been a six months marked, first, by the crumbling of so-called Trump trades that were premised on U.S. President Donald Trump's pledges of multi-trillion dollar spending. The second feature has been a political and growth outlook shift in Europe which has lured investors back to the continent. As this graphic shows reut.rs/2sxO66c 16-17 percent gains in emerging markets and Europe on a dollar-adjusted basis have boosted world stocks around 10 percent so far this year. Oil on the other hand is 2017's worst performer, despite almost 2 million barrels-per-day of OPEC supply cuts. Undercut by high output from shale and some producers such as Nigeria, Brent crude futures have slumped 20 percent in their biggest first-half drop since 1997. The price moves have rekindled memories of the 50 percent rout seen in the second half of 2014. But equities have held up well despite a hefty tech share selloff earlier in June and a run of softer U.S. economic data which hint at slowing price growth and a major setback for the  Trumpflation  trades in vogue at the start of 2017. Despite two Federal Reserve rate hikes already this year, the dollar has fallen 4.5 percent against the world's other top currencies -- its worst start to a year since 2006.  From a global perspective it is increasing the appetite for risky assets,  said ABN Amro's chief investment officer Didier Duret. Duret also noted the defeat for far-right, anti-establishment parties in French and Dutch elections, as well as a synchronised recovery in world growth. The euro zone is seen growing 2 percent this year, its best run in a decade, while latest data shows consumer confidence at a 16-year high. In Brexit-bound Britain, which has just been through a messy election, the pound has dropped 3 percent against the euro, whereas UK government bonds and the FTSE 100 have risen 2.4 and 6.4 percent respectively. Emerging markets too have enjoyed a trade and growth bounce.  There is a growing recognition we are seeing accumulative stability, with lower volatility and lower correlation between assets and this is constructive for creating momentum for equities,  Duret said. While U.S. stocks have returned almost 10 percent year-to-date, many investors reckon European stocks offer better value - funds polled by Reuters every month have just upped euro zone equity exposure to a nine-month high.  Previously there were lots of reasons not to invest in Europe. Now Europe is growing faster than the U.S.,  said Pictet Asset Management's chief strategist Luca Paolini, who prefers European and emerging stocks. The past week has seen biggest U.S. equity outflows in five weeks. Perfect Landing Emerging markets have shrugged off the U.S. rate rises and the oil and tech tumbles. While emerging equities are the top performers, bonds in emerging market currencies have returned almost 10 percent in dollar terms, while hard currency sovereign debt is up 6 percent.  At the end of last year, everyone was long dollar but suddenly people realised the dollar was getting weaker. Usually when that happens it's very good for EM assets,  said Francois Savary, CIO of Swiss investment manager Prime Partners. There is likely room for more gains in the coming year, given the sector has underperformed for five years, he added. But within emerging markets there are losers as well as winners: tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5 Russian equities, heavily oil-reliant and a star of late 2016, have lost 17 percent but energy importer Turkey's stock index has risen 30 percent, despite inflation, domestic political risks and policy wobbles. The Mexican peso is the world's top performing currency, up 14 percent on the dollar, as faith wanes in Trump's ability to implement anti-trade and anti-immigration pledges. Perhaps the biggest surprise has been Poland's zloty which has surged more than 10 percent against the dollar, outstripping the euro's 5.8 percent rise. Brazil's real has been one of the worst-performing currencies, down 5 percent in 2017 due to fresh corruption scandals that have hit the country.  The question for the next six months is how far the positive European momentum should go,  said ABN's Duret.  And can China control its slowdown. Can it continue to achieve a perfect soft landing?

Italy began winding up two failed regional banks on Sunday in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros ($19 billion) and will leave the lenders' good assets in the hands of the nation's biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo. The yield on Italy's 10-year debt came off recent lows on the news - given that it means the country's debt level will rise - but the increase was capped by relief that a banking crisis would probably be averted.  There is the danger that other banks need state support, but I think there's more clarity now that there is a solution for the banking sector,  said ING strategist Martin van Vliet. Italy's bond yield spread over Germany widened to 168 basis points on Monday, off last week's low of 160.5 bps but well below this month's peak of 203.5 basis points. BBVA strategists believe that if the entire 17 billion euros is used, it would add about 1 percentage point to the country's debt as a percentage of its economic output. Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio is among the highest in the world at 132.6 percent at the end of 2016, according to EU data. Though the strategists believe the addition to the debt burden is offset by the end of uncertainty on this issue, they warned there may be more issues surrounding the sector.  We should recall that this will not be the end of the noise about the banking system affecting the sovereign as there still remain some issues with Banca Cariage as well as some pending issues with Monte di Paschi di Siena,  they said in a note. Italy was also in the news on the political front,  its centre-right parties proving the big winners in mayoral elections on Sunday, partial results showed. The vote is likely to put pressure on the centre-left government ahead of national elections due in less than a year. Later on Monday, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to speak, at a time when investors are looking for clues on when the bank will end its ultra-loose monetary policy stance. Most high-grade euro zone bond yields were unchanged on Monday, with 10-year German bond yields edging lower to 0.25 percent.

Roche is counting on emicizumab to wrest a share of the $11 billion-a-year haemophilia drug market now dominated by traditional treatments from Novo Nordisk and Shire . The drugmaker released the data ahead of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) industry meeting in Berlin next month. In the late-stage study, 62.9 percent of patients receiving emicizumab experienced zero treated bleeds compared to 5.6 percent of those receiving so-called bypassing agents, Roche said. Haemophilia patients' blood does not clot properly, requiring life-saving infusions of clotting factors. Development of resistance, or inhibitors, in many of those being treated can interfere with efforts to control their bleeding, so Roche is hoping its drug, also known as ACE910, will offer a new avenue of treatment. Analysts called Monday's data release convincing, with Jefferies saying it underpins its $5 billion peak sales estimate for the medicine.  If full presentation of the data at the ISTH reassure on safety, our mid-term EPS estimates and valuation could increase by 2 percent to 4 percent,  Jefferies' Jeffrey Holford wrote in a note to investors. Still, analysts continue to cite several adverse events in Roche's studies including thrombotic microangiopathy - damage to blood vessels in vital organs -- that accompanied repeated high doses of bypassing agents to treat breakthrough bleeds. Though Roche has said one death came after a patient refused a blood transfusion for religious reasons, analysts' concern remains.  From a safety perspective, treatment with this drug will require physicians to carefully manage the use of bypassing agents,  wrote Vontobel's Stefan Schneider. That  could limit uptake , he said. Roche plans to file the drug with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval for patients with inhibitors later this year, with follow-on submissions in 2018.

A small dip for the yen  early in European trade was driven by mildly improved appetite for risk among investors and helped keep the dollar index roughly flat on the day as Britain's pound inched higher. Sterling has recovered 1.5 cents from lows hit in the past 10 days due to uncertainty over the makeup of the next government, helped by a shift by several Bank of England policymakers towards raising interest rates this year. But markets so far are loathe to buy the Fed's own line that it will raise U.S. rates once more before the end of 2017 and another three times next year. That has kept Treasury yields at historically low levels and halted any progress for the greenback. It traded 0.1 percent weaker at $1.1203 per euro and 0.2 percent stronger at 111.47 yen by 0730 GMT.  The market continues to call the Fed's bluff on its intentions to change rates. I don't think anything (Fed chair) Janet Yellen can say this week will change that,  said Stephen Gallo, head of European FX strategy with Bank of Montreal.  We were saying buy dips in cable and euro (against the dollar) last week. We still look for the same this week.  Yellen makes a hotly awaited speech in Europe on Tuesday. She is preceded by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Monday, watched for signs he is ready to let the ECB move more forcibly towards a reduction in emergency stimulus for the economy this year that should support the euro. The dollar index hit a one-month peak of 97.871 earlier last week, supported by expectations that the Fed, fresh from a mid-June rate hike, would tighten policy again as early as September. But such expectations ebbed again as another round of U.S. economic indicators fell short of forecasts; market pricing puts the chances of a hike by the end of December at just one in three.  The main reason behind the weakness of the dollar, which has lost its upward momentum since the Fed rate hike, is U.S. yields stuck at low altitude,  said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  Yields appear to better reflect U.S. fundamentals relative to equities, and in focus this week are political developments and the various indicators due for release.  U.S. data due this week include the June consumer confidence indicator, pending home sales, crude oil inventories, revised first quarter GDP and the PCE price index. On the political front, the U.S. Senate hopes to vote on a healthcare bill this week to replace Obamacare. But with as many as five Republican senators opposing the bill, getting a vote by the end of this week could be difficult.

A company spokesman also said the company needed to wrap up an appeals process for around 1,500 miners who face possible dismissal for taking part in a violent wildcat strike that started almost three weeks ago in protest against a company drive to root out illegal miners. Illegal gold mining has plagued South Africa for decades, with bullion pilfered from both disused and operating mines, and Sibanye has vowed it will clear all illegal miners from its shafts by January 2018.  We hope to have the appeals process done by the middle of the week and then we can resume production later this week,  company spokesman James Wellsted said. Workers at the mine downed tools over resentment at the company crackdown against illegal miners, which has included the arrest of employees for collusion and a ban on taking food underground. Underscoring the scale of the problem, 461 illegal miners have been arrested at Cooke since the stoppage began. They have been forced to come to the surface because of the strike, which has emptied the shafts of employees, thereby starving them of their sources of food and water underground - an unintended consequence of the strike.  Located about 60 kms (35 miles) south-west of Johannesburg, the Cooke mine produces about 181,700 ounces of gold a year and brings in around 377 million rand ($29 million) in operating profit, or just over 6 percent of the group's total.

Participants included Chelsea Manning, the transgender U.S. Army soldier who served seven years in prison for leaking classified data before former President Barack Obama granted her clemency.   Honored to represent the ACLU at this years NYC Pride March,  Manning said on Twitter, posting a photo of her riding in a red convertible.  Started to lose my voice from screaming so much,  Manning, who was released from a military prison in May, added.  A group of marchers heading down New York's Fifth Avenue carried photographs of U.S. President Donald Trump and his press secretary, Sean Spicer, as others waved banners bearing the word 'RESIST' and the rainbow flag of the Pride movement. In contrast, a smattering of anti-Trump signs in San Francisco was drowned out by a desire to let loose.  It's too good a day to be upset about Trump,  said Richard Babb, 66, of San Francisco.  In New York, Brad Hoylman, a Democratic lawmaker in the New York State Senate, said lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people were  under assault  by the Trump administration.  He already rolled back rights for transgender students, for example, and the list is on and on,  he said.  So we have a lot more work to do, that's why we are here today.  As a candidate, Trump promised to protect gay people. But his move in February to revoke the Obama administration's guidance letting transgender students choose which gender bathroom they use, and his executive order last month to promote religious liberty have been seen by some as discriminatory.  The New York march's grand marshals this year include the American Civil Liberties Union, which was chosen for its history of litigation defending gay rights; Brooke Guinan, a transgender woman who works as a firefighter in the city; and Geng Le, a gay rights activist in China.  Pride this year is showing that we are here, we are queer, and we are not going to sit down for anything less than full rights, full equality,  said Austin Anderson, a 28-year-old advertising worker at the New York event.      Participants take part in the LGBT Pride March in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., June 25, 2017.Carlo AllegriThe march route ends on Christopher Street in Manhattan's West Village to commemorate the riots that broke out there in 1969 after police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, in an event seen as a turning point in the gay rights movement. New York's first Pride march started close by a year later.  West Coast Parties In San Francisco, revelers had to pass through one of dozens of metal security detectors to get into the main plaza. Slideshow (14 Images) Happy Pride everyone!  a security monitor yelled to the crowd, as people cheered and saluted.  Have fun today.  Two gay cousins attended the parade dressed in tutus and unicorn headbands.   We see this as a party, not a political protest,  Qiaira McPeters, 18, said. Despite that, McPeters said that she feels things for gay people have been getting worse.   Gay people are getting beat up all the time,  she said.  In Seattle, hundreds of people marched downtown in unusually hot weather, many in skimpy outfits and carrying pink balloons. A rainbow flag was hoisted to the top of the city's iconic Space Needle.  Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, the first openly gay person to hold that job, joined the parade with his husband, Michael Shiosaki.  Today we celebrate our unity,  he said in a video posted on Twitter. The Seattle Police Department, which put rainbow-colored decals on their patrol cars, said a group of people blocked the parade route for about 30 minutes to hold a sit-in in honor of Charleena Lyles, the black mother slain by city police a week ago. There were no arrests, police said. [L1N1JG04T] Writing by Jonathan Allen and Eric M.

More than 118 people were injured in the explosion in the eastern province of Punjab, which came as people gathered to collect leaking fuel after the tanker overturned on Sunday, government officials and rescue workers said. The disaster was one of several deadly events to mar the run-up to Monday's Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. At least 65 people were killed in bombings in two cities on Friday claimed by Islamist militants including the Pakistani Taliban and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. A burst tyre apparently caused the speeding fuel tanker to overturn on a sharp bend on a highway on the outskirts of the city of Bahawalpur, provincial spokesman Malik Muhammed Ahmed Khan said. It was not clear what triggered the fireball but on Sunday, a spokesman for rescue services said someone was believed to have lit a cigarette.  Rehabilitation and treatment of the victims is our top priority,  Khan said. Hospitals are also arranging DNA testing to identify the many bodies that were charred beyond recognition.

The Shanghai SE 50 Index, an index tracking the 50 most representative blue-chips on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, advanced 0.6 percent to an 18-month high. The index has gained 11.2 percent in 2017, versus a gain of 2.6 percent in the benchmark SSEC. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.3 percent, to 3,668.09 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index ticked up 0.9 percent to 3,185.44 points. Shanghai Securities News reported MSCI Inc Chief Executive Henry Fernandez saying MSCI could raise the future weighting of China 'A' shares in its Emerging Markets Index, potentially adding 195 mid-sized stocks. MSCI's decision to add 222 China-listed large-cap stocks to its Emerging Markets Index (EMI), tracked by around $1.6 trillion, has already fuelled a blue-chip buying spree on the mainland.  For now we are optimistic about the 'A' share market, which has been picking up recently, aided by better policy and liquidity conditions,  Haitong Securities wrote in a report. Listed companies in the 'A' share market are also expected to record rapid profit growth in the second quarter and for the full year, the brokerage added. Sectors rallied across the board. The top performing real estate sector jumped 4.6 percent to a near seven-month high, led by bellwether China Vanke which soared 10 percent for the second straight session. The market showed scant reaction to news that China imposed a penalty of nearly 700 million yuan ($102.30 million) on a Russian-controlled high-frequency trading firm on Friday for futures market manipulation.

The Nikkei rose 0.1 percent to 20,153.35, with the psychologically important 20,000 mark seen as immediate support. On June 20, the index hit 20,318.  The 20,000 level is a key support level with positive focus to increase on stock specific earnings, corporate actions and return-on-equity increases,  said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading Limited. The broader Topix was up 0.1 percent to 1,612.21 but turnover hit its lowest level in more than two months due to lack of macroeconomic themes giving markets a clear direction. Trading centred on individual shares, such as Toshiba Corp , which tumbled 3.1 percent after the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) decided to downgrade the stock to its second section from August. Shares of the TSE's Mothers start-up market also saw active trading, with its index rising 2.3 percent. Among them, Klab rose 3.1 percent in heavy trade after the game company announced it would release a new one it has been developing with media company Broccoli this summer. Broccoli shares rose 5.2 percent. Elsewhere, financial stocks lost ground, with banks and insurers falling 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group dropped 1.4 percent, Dai-ichi Life Holdings shed 0.9 percent and T&D; Holdings declined 0.9 percent. Investors watched developments at Takata Corp, which filed for bankruptcy protection. The embattled air bag inflator maker said it would seek $1.588 billion in financial aid from U.S.-based auto parts supplier Key Safety Systems (KSS). The Tokyo Stock Exchange said shares of Takata would be delisted on July 27 after it filed for bankruptcy protection. The stock was suspended for all of Monday, after closing at 160 yen on Friday.  Takata's bankruptcy is bad news, but since the market has long known that the company was in trouble, its impact to overall investor sentiment is limited,  said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.

As Italy's interior minister later flew in to present the boats officially at a naval base in the Libyan capital, coast guards grumbled that the vessels were old and had little deck space for rescued migrants.  They want us to be Europe's policeman. At the same time, that policeman needs resources,  said naval coastguard spokesman Ayoub Qassem.  I challenge anyone to work in these conditions.       Half a million people have crossed the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy over the past four years, mainly sub-Saharan Africans who pay smugglers to shepherd them across the desert to Libya, and onward to Europe in unseaworthy dinghies. An estimated 13,000 of them have drowned. European governments want to stop the migrants and break the grip of the smugglers. But more than four months after Italy and the European Union launched a new push to tackle the crisis, accounts by migrants, aid workers and officials show that effort is all but failing to make a difference. When Libyan authorities do catch migrants, they take them to detention centers nominally under the control of the government, which already house about 8,000 people. Though Europeans have pledged funding to improve the camps, some are still so cramped that migrants have to sleep sitting up.  At Tripoli's Tariq al-Siqqa migrant center, where visiting dignitaries are brought, flowers have been planted in the courtyard and wash-basins installed. But behind a padlocked metal gate hundreds of migrants still languish, crammed side to side on mattresses in a single unventilated room.   They shut us up, they imprison us, they ask us for money,  said one 22-year-old from Guinea, who has been in the center since March, when he was intercepted by the Libyan coastguard with about 120 other migrants shortly after they set off for Italy.  They hit people. They don't like black skin.      No Turkey Deal in North Africa The sea route from the Libyan coast is one of two main routes in the biggest flow of migrants to Europe since World War Two. The other, by sea from Turkey to Greece, was largely shut down last year after an agreement between the EU and Ankara, but the flow from Libya has only increased. This year has already seen 70,000 people make the journey, with the summer peak season for the voyage only just beginning. An estimated 2,000 have died so far this year. Unlike Turkey, Libya is still seen as too dangerous for Europeans to send migrants back, so those who make it into international waters usually end up in Italy. Libya's people-smuggling networks flourished amid the upheaval that followed the revolution that toppled dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi in 2011, and their trade surged after 2014, when conflict spread and rival governments were set up in Tripoli and the east. Since last year, the EU has made a push to cooperate with a new Libyan government backed by the United Nations. Coastguard training began on board EU ships in October. In February, Italy signed a memorandum of understanding with Tripoli that the EU quickly endorsed, earmarking 90 million euros. But Europe has delivered little concrete support, said Tarek Shanbour, a senior coastguard official.  We meet, we talk, we take decisions, we make agreements, but on the ground there is no execution.  The Libyan government has little sway outside the capital or even over some of the ministries within it. Its authority has been rejected in the east and is barely felt in the south where smugglers bring migrants in across the Sahara.  So far we can't say as the European Union we've achieved much,  a European official said on condition of anonymity.  The point is we need short term solutions but there are no short term solutions. There is no Turkey deal in North Africa.  Migrants Abused As European policy makers study longer-term schemes to improve security on Libya's southern borders, wean communities off smuggling, and provide aid in migrants' countries of origin, Libyan officials worry that numbers inside Libya will swell. They say they have little capacity to host migrants in a country deep in economic crisis, where nearly 250,000 are still internally displaced. European funding has helped increase voluntary repatriations of migrants caught in Libya who agree to return home, but this is unlikely to surpass 10,000 this year. Migrants caught by the Libyan coastguard at sea or swept up in nighttime raids are detained in migrant centers, both official ones nominally run by the government and others run by an array of armed groups. Those running the centers raise money by making migrants or their families pay for their release, selling them back to smugglers or hiring them out for labor, migrants say. Sexual abuse is common, according to a former member of staff at one of the Tripoli centers. In unofficial centers and holding houses in western and southern Libya, run by militias or even by smugglers themselves, conditions are said to be far worse. Migrants say video or audio of them being tortured is relayed to their families to extort cash transfer payments. Migrants at Tariq Siqqa who were previously held at another, half-built camp near Tripoli's Mitiga airport said they were forced to build the center themselves. Several had died from untreated illnesses. A Reuters request to visit the center was declined.  Detention center staff say they lack resources, and sometimes have to use force with desperate or unruly migrants. Mohamed Bishr, the head of Tripoli's Department of Combating Illegal Migration (DCIM), dismissed reports of abuse and killings, saying migrants were detained for their protection.  Given the security situation inside the Libyan state they cannot leave the detention centers because they do not have identification documents,  he said, speaking in a roomy, air conditioned office inside the Tariq Siqqa center.  They might face the worst if they leave.  Additional reporting by Ahmed Elumami","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-libya-idUSKBN19H0MB"},

The Co-op Bank, which provides banking services to almost 4 million retail and small and medium sized enterprises, said it was in advanced talks with a group of existing investors over a deal, which includes a recapitalisation. A deal would allow the bank to meet the longer term capital requirements demanded by the regulator and to continue as a stand-alone entity, while safeguarding its values and ethics, it said in a statement. The bank, which put itself up for sale in February, nearly collapsed in 2013 after losses from problem real estate loans and has been struggling to rebuild its financial health. Co-op said it was discussing its capital raise options with the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority. A majority of the key commercial aspects of the deal had been  substantially agreed , it said, and it was in advanced talks over how to manage the group's pension liabilities, it said in response to media reports of an impending deal.  Discussions are continuing between the parties, including on other key matters, with a view to agreeing the final aspects of the Proposal and a further announcement will be made in due course,  it said. As a result, the Co-op said it had decided to discontinue a formal sale process. In an update on its financials, the Co-op said it now targeted an improved capital position, sustainable profitability in the medium term and a mid-single digit return-on-equity in 2021.

The company, a part of A.P. Moller-Maersk, said it had finished installing the Remote Container Management (RCM) tool on all of its 270,000 refrigerated containers, also known as reefers, and will now offer it to customers. The tool will help measure location, temperature, humidity and power status in real time. With the tool, Maersk is hoping to grow volumes within more traditional chilled perishable cargo like bananas, fish and meat, but also to expand into transport of high-valued pharmaceutical products where it now has a small presence. Pharmaceuticals are currently transported mainly via air and less than 20 percent is being shipped, Maersk's head of Reefer, Anne Sophie Zerlang told Reuters on Monday, adding that the market had a potential to reach 100,000 containers a year.  We're definitely looking to make the container market bigger by RCM,  Zerlang said.  We are also hoping to penetrate newer markets like the pharma industry ... It has a very big potential but has extremely specific requirements because of the very high value of the cargo.  Maersk expects to transport one million reefers this year. The RCM tool is the latest in the more than 100-year old conglomerate A.P. Moller-Maersk's push into new technologies. The container shipping industry has lagged some other sectors in bringing more of its processes online, and there is still a huge amount of paperwork slowing down the handling and tracking of containers.

Following is a summary of key issues facing the company and its financial sponsor, U.S.-based auto parts supplier Key Safety Systems: Why Is Takata Filing for Bankruptcy Protection? The company says it is facing between $10 billion and $50 billion in liabilities from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits linked to its defective air bag inflators, which could explode with too much force, sending metal shrapnel into vehicle compartments. At least 17 people have been killed and 180 injured globally. So far, about 100 million inflators have been slated for recall, a process which will take until about 2020 to complete. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will protect Takata from creditors and clears the way for it to receive financial support from Key Safety Systems, a Chinese-owned company based in Michigan. Takata says it is seeking $1.6 billion in aid from KSS, which will allow Takata to continue to operate without interruptions. What's Going to Happen to Takata? Takata will essentially be divided into two companies. The first company will be controlled by KSS and consist of Takata's  healthy  assets and operations, including its seatbelt and steering wheel divisions. The second company, which will be transferred back to Takata's U.S. arm or another subsidiary, will be reorganized and continue to supply replacement inflators for the recall, operating independently from KSS. The new sponsor will not be liable for these inflators, which use ammonium nitrate, the volatile chemical compound at the root of the defective airbags. Meanwhile, Takata faces class action lawsuits from people claiming injuries as a result of exploding airbags, while it must also reach agreements with its automaker customers over how to divide up payment responsibilities for recall costs.  How Does This Affect the Global Recall Process? Both Takata and KSS say that the U.S. and Japanese filings should have  no effect  on access to replacement inflators. Still, only about 35 percent of U.S. recalls, which account for about half of all affected vehicles globally, have been completed. This compares with a completion rate of about 73 percent in Japan. The reorganized, Takata-run company will continue to produce ammonium nitrate inflators until the current global recall for inflators without a drying agent is completed, which Takata estimates will happen around 2020. Their replacements contain a drying agent to absorb excess moisture created by high temperatures, an idea Takata has come up with as a solution for the exploding airbags. It has until the end of 2019 to prove to U.S. transport authorities that these airbags are safe. If it fails to do so, Takata may face yet another recall to withdraw all of its ammonium nitrate-based inflators from the global market. What's Next for Takata? Takata shares will be delisted on July 27, although their value has dropped more than 90 percent since its last major stock price peak in January 2014. KSS says it hopes to complete the final agreement and transition in the first quarter of 2018, at which point Takata executives, including CEO Shigehisa Takada, the grandson of the company founder, will resign. According to Reuters sources, the new company would stop using the Takata brand, and have air bags, seatbelts and other components rebranded as KSS products.

He reckons the $263 billion goliath should dump its 23 percent stake in L'Oreal – which Breakingviews said in February there  was no good reason  for it to hold – and borrow more money to buy back shares. The company's  staid culture and tendency towards incrementalism  also need addressing, Loeb wrote in a letter to his investors on Sunday.  Sprawling conglomerates often attract attention, but can be hard to push around. Nelson Peltz, for example, never managed to break up Pepsi. Earlier this year, his Trian Fund turned its attention to $230 billion Procter & Gamble, where Bill Ackman's Pershing Square had ventured earlier with little to show for it. Likewise, Ackman started pestering Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Mondelez, where Peltz also was an investor, but the stock price hasn't budget since Ackman bought a $5.5 billion stake in August 2015.  Corporate muscle has run into strong defenses, too. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise, in February swatted off a $143 billion takeover approach from Kraft Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett and the Brazilian investors at 3G. And Hershey rejected unwanted advances from Mondelez last year. Loeb is obviously undaunted. He dared into the entrenched boardrooms of corporate Japan, on the back of initiatives spearheaded by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The Third Point boss scored some wins, including wringing higher payouts out of robot-maker Fanuc. Despite walking off with a profit from an investment at Sony, however, the Japanese electronics heavyweight rejected his demands to spin off its entertainment business. Nestle is a tastier target. Ulf Mark Schneider is still settling into the CEO's seat. He started by scaling back sales growth targets, a pattern under his predecessor. As the bedrock of Switzerland's multinational success, Nestle presents a formidable mountain for Loeb. Yet he may find it somewhat movable.

The Japanese group has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Japan, citing more than $10 billion of liabilities related to lethal airbags. This is a big opportunity for smaller rival Key Safety Systems, a Chinese-owned American brand which agreed in principle to buy most of the business for $1.6 billion. There was no way the Japanese parts supplier could afford the industry’s biggest-ever recall. So while some proceeds will go into an $850 million restitution fund, as agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice, that will hardly cover the total costs incurred by its customers, including Honda, Toyota and others. Still, the outcome should minimise disruption for the manufacturers. A residual business will keep supplying replacement airbag inflators before being wound down. Everything else Takata sold can now be bought from KSS. And partnering with KSS, rather than a big competitor like Autoliv, means carmakers retain more choice in suppliers.  This is a blot on corporate Japan to rival the stain from Toshiba, which is being demoted from the first section of the bourse and frantically selling its best business. Huge cost overruns in its U.S. nuclear subsidiary showed up Toshiba’s project-management failings; Takata’s failure has dented Japan’s reputation for technical excellence. In both cases, weak governance allowed problems to fester. Investors look foolish too. As recently as January, Takata’s market value exceeded $750 million despite looming liabilities.  This is a huge boost for KSS. It implies a dramatic increase in scale – the firm was bought by Ningbo Joyson for just $920 million last year. That a Chinese-owned entity would gain a foothold in Japan’s vaunted auto industry thanks to poor quality control was once hard to imagine. But crisis can spark change. It helps that KSS is American and run independently, and Takata has few friends left among carmakers. The price looks reasonable. Suppose KSS only salvages half the revenues Takata made last year, as customers go elsewhere. At an 8 percent margin that would yield 26.5 billion yen of EBITDA, a Breakingviews calculation suggests. That implies a price of 6.6 times EBITDA, while Autoliv trades on 7.5 times forward EBITDA. Still, no one can blame KSS for wanting to drive safely.

European shares are seen opening little changed. Spread-betters expect Britain's FTSE to open 0.1 percent higher and Germany's DAX and France's CAC to start almost flat. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.4 percent as tech counters led gains in Korean and Taiwanese shares to record highs and 27-year highs respectively. [ Trading was slow with many markets in the region closed for holidays to celebrate the end of Ramadan. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.1 percent. Mainland Chinese shares rallied, with the CSI300 index rising 1.2 percent to hit its highest level in almost a year and a half, after the MSCI chief said the index provider could raise its weighting of China's mainland-listed 'A' shares. The prospect of solid global economic growth has kept alive investor optimism for world equities even as some markets, including Wall Street, have slowed from a meteoric run because of high valuations. Share prices have also been supported by relatively loose monetary policies in the developed world, with the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank still pumping in funds. The U.S. Federal Reserve is gradually tightening its policy, but investors think the pace of its tightening will be much slower than policymakers want, given subdued U.S. inflation. Money market futures  price in only about 50 percent chance of another rate hike by the end of the year, compared to Fed's own projection of one more rate increase. That hardly changed after San Francisco Fed President John Williams said the U.S. central bank needs to keep raising rates gradually with the U.S. economy at full employment and inflation set to hit the Fed's two-percent target next year. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 2.153 percent, not far from seven-month low of 2.103 percent hit mid-June, after news that inflation had undershot expectations for a third straight month. The 30-year yield hit 7-1/2-month low of 2.710 percent on Friday, making the yield curve the flattest in almost a decade. It last stood at 2.722 percent. The lower yields have put the dollar on the defensive, though some market players say both Treasury yields and the dollar could rise if U.S. President Donald Trump manages to push his healthcare bill through Congress.  There will be renewed focus on U.S. healthcare bill. Its passage in the parliament could lead to expectations that the administration will get down to stimulus next,  said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell has pushed for a vote on the bill before the July 4th Independence Day holiday recess that begins at the end of this week. Yet he can afford to lose the support of only two Republicans in the face of unanimous Democratic opposition, while five Republican senators have said they will not support the bill in its current form. The dollar stood at 111.29 yen, off last week's high of 111.79. The euro traded at $1.1194, slowly recovering from its three-week low of $1.1119 touched on Tuesday. A strong reading in Germany's Ifo business sentiment survey due at 0800 GMT could open the way for a test of $1.1296, its seven-month high hit earlier this month. The euro was little damaged by the news that Italy began winding up two failed regional banks on Sunday in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros ($19 billion).  This won't cause a major financial crisis considering the current strength of the euro zone economy,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. Oil prices ticked up after having fallen for five weeks in a row on concerns OPEC-led production cuts have failed to ease a global crude glut stemming in part from increased U.S. oil production. U.S. energy firms added 11 oil rigs in the week to June 23, bringing the total count up to 758 RIG-OL-USA-BHI, the most since April 2014, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc. Brent crude futures rose 1.1 percent to $46.02 per barrel from seven month lows of $44.35 hit last week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fetched $43.47 per barrel, up 1.1 percent on the day and extending gains from their 10-month low of $42.05 set on Wednesday.  There is some support near $40 in the WTI. People think that U.S. shale development will stop if it falls below $40,  said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior economist at Nomura Securities.

Italy began winding up the two failed regional banks on Sunday in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros ($19 billion) and will leave the lenders' good assets in the hands of Intesa, the nation's biggest retail bank. Rome spent the weekend drafting an emergency decree to liquidate the two banks, which collapsed after years of mismanagement and poor lending. The decree will have to be voted into law by parliament within 60 days. The government will pay 5.2 billion euros ($5.82 billion) to Intesa, and give it guarantees of up 12 billion euros, so that it will take over the remains of the banks.  Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's best-capitalized large bank, said last week it was open to purchasing the rump of the good assets for one euro on condition that Italy's government passed a decree agreeing to shoulder the cost of winding down the two banks. Intesa said on Monday the contract it had signed for the acquisition would become void should the decree not be converted into law or be amended in a way that would make the deal more expensive for the lender  Reporting by Agnieszka Flak, editing by Louise Heavens","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-banks-italy-veneto-idUSL8N1JN0NV"},

Story:              Related stories:                               MACRON: French President Emmanuel Macron and four eastern European Union leaders sought to smooth relations on Friday after publicly trading barbs over jobs and democratic values.     Macron, in power for little more than a month, has vowed to protect French workers from what he sees as  social dumping , in which companies employ cheaper labour, and unfair competition from the poorer eastern European states.     Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic say they should be allowed to compete on lower prices - just as more developed western EU nations compete on quality products and know-how - to catch up after decades of communist stagnation.

Speaking on the sidelines of a consumer protection conference in Prague, EBA Chairman Andrea Enria said there remained a misperception that the bad loan problem was only concentrated in a few countries.

The following are some of the factors that may move German stocks: Allianz Indicated 0.2 percent higher Allianz has agreed to sell its 90 percent stake in private bank Oldenburgische Landesbank (OLB) to U.S. private equity firm Apollo for 300 million euros ($336 million), it said late on Friday. Commerzbank Indicated 0.5 percent higher Commerzbank customers in Germany were unable to withdraw cash from ATMs or use their EC cards for payments for much of Saturday due to a maintenance operation that took longer than expected. Commerzbank said all services were restored at 1600 local time and apologised to its customers via Facebook. Daimler Indicated unchanged An investigation into possible fraud linked to diesel emissions is  far far advanced , Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche told Deutschlandfunk in an interview broadcast on Sunday. Deutsche Bank Indicated 0.3 percent higher UBS was excluded from Deutsche Bank's rights issue after the German lender learned its Swiss rival had been trying to poach Asian wealth management staff, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation. e.on, Rwe, Uniper E.ON indicated 0.2 percent higher RWE indicated 0.4 percent higher Uniper indicated unchanged The German government is due to sign the contract for the financing of a nuclear waste fund with power utilities on Monday, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported on Saturday. RWE's finance chief declined to comment in Boersen-Zeitung at the weekend on whether RWE could be interested in buying E.ON's stake in Uniper, or a stake in Steag, but said he was pleased there was suddenly so much fantasy about the future of the market.  We can afford to sit back and examine all options in peace,  he said. Lufthansa, Air Berlin Lufthansa indicated 0.4 percent higher Air Berlin indicated 8.9 percent lower Lufthansa sees no limit to the number of planes and crews it could lease from Air Berlin, its chief executive told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, amid criticism that support for its ailing rival is a stealth takeover attempt. Munich Re Indicated 0.3 percent higher Global reinsurers have written to the European Commission to ask it to ensure mutual access between British and European Union reinsurance markets after Britain leaves the bloc due to worries about market disruption, according to extracts from a letter seen by Reuters. Volkswagen Indicated 0.2 percent higher A lawyer for former Volkswagen manager Heinz-Jakob Neusser, who is sought in the United States in connection with the carmaker's diesel emissions-cheating scandal, has advised him not to leave Germany, she told Bild Zeitung. In separate comments to Welt am Sonntag, she added that she expected a criminal process to be launched also in Germany, but not for many months yet. Volkswagen's Slovak unit said on Sunday it had reached a wage deal with a trade union to end a six-day strike that has hit production at the country's biggest private employer. Also, Audi's management board, including Chief Executive Rupert Stadler, has been sharply criticised by company managers, Bild am Sonntag reported on Sunday, citing an internal dossier. Hannover Re Indicated 0.2 percent higher Hannover Re will reach its profit targets despite expecting low interest rates to prevail in the euro zone for the next five to 10 years, as it expects to make returns of at least 2.7 percent on capital markets, its finance chief told Euro am Sonntag. Stada Indicated 0.5 percent higher Buyout groups Bain Capital and Cinven had to wait over the weekend to see whether their takeover bid for the German generic drugmaker Stada has been successful, two sources familiar with the situation said. Dialog Semiconductor Indicated 1.2 percent higher The group is actively looking for larger acquisitions to reach a target of reducing its reliance on Apple by five to 10 percent per year, Swiss paper Finanz und Wirtschaft cited Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli as saying in its Saturday edition. It has roughly $400 million liquidity for acquisitions and share buybacks, he said. Sartorius Indicated 0.6 percent higher Sartorius can raise over 1 billion euros for acquisitions via debt, own shares and a capital hike at biotech subsidiary Sartorius Stedim Biotech, CEO Joachim Kreuzburg told Euro am Sonntag. Slm Solutions Up 2.3 percent in early Frankfurt trade The 3D printer maker said it had won a major order worth up to 12 million euros from China. Surteco Indicated 1.3 percent higher Surteco agreed to buy Portuguese PVC edgebandings maker Probos from private equity firm Alantra for 99 million euros in cash, it said on Saturday. Vapiano Vapiano said on Sunday it would offer 3.7 million shares in Tuesday's IPO, targeting gross proceeds of around 85 million euros. The shares will be issued at 23 euros apiece, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.

By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 26 (Reuters) - Here's a question for the anti-coal lobby. If coal is dying, how come there is an increasingly heated bidding war going on for Rio Tinto's coal mines in Australia? Here's another question, this time for the pro-coal lobby. If coal still has a viable long-term future as an energy source, how come the world's biggest planned new mine is now hostage to whether the Australian government decides to loan it money? Reconciling these two questions may seem like a challenge but both the battle for Rio Tinto's existing mines and the struggles of India's Adani to build its Carmichael project neatly show where coal currently finds itself. Rio's mines in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney are attractive to both Glencore and China's Yancoal because they are likely to be profitable for the remaining life of the pits, which is expected to be around 20 years. The Rio mines already have all the necessary infrastructure, being connected by rail to the major export harbour of Newcastle, the world's largest coal export port. They also have existing customers for the high quality thermal coal used to generate electricity, including utilities in Japan, which have preferred long-term supply agreements over the more volatile spot shipments that are more characteristic of deals to sell to major importers China and India. In some ways the Rio mines up for sale are insulated from the downturn in global coal demand expected over the next 30 years, because they supply fuel to customers who are likely to be among the last to switch off coal-fired generators, assuming renewables do eventually succeed in killing off the polluting fuel. Acquiring an existing asset is likely far more attractive to a company such as Glencore than developing new mines, with the associated capital costs and inevitable opposition from environmental groups. Glencore raised its offer for Rio's Hunter Valley mines to $2.675 billion in cash on June 23, making its bid some $225 million more than Yancoal's proposal. Rio said it would study the revised Glencore offer, having previously accepted the lower Yancoal bid on the grounds that it could be completed more quickly as it had regulatory approvals. Coal May Be Dying, but It's Going to Linger It may seem incongruous to environmentalists that there is a bidding war for something that has been declared a dying industry, but there is still a medium-term future for coal, and Glencore and Yancoal are trying to profit from that. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its medium-term coal market report in December that it still expects growth in coal demand up to 2021, albeit at a considerably slower rate. The rise in coal demand is likely to be driven by India and Southeast Asia, according to the IEA, with top consumer China actually using less by 2021 than in 2015. The IEA expects global coal demand to be 5.636 billion tonnes of coal equivalent in 2021, up from 5.4 billion in 2015, equating to an average annual growth rate of 0.6 percent, down from 2.5 percent over the decade to 2015. Like all forecasts, the IEA's estimates can be undone by changing circumstances, and it does appear to be the case that renewable energy sources like solar and wind are making faster than initially expected inroads, especially in India. It's this mounting uncertainty that is making it hard for Adani to get its planned 25-million tonne a year Carmichael mine in Queensland state to a stage where it can actually start construction. While the Indian conglomerate has taken what it termed a final investment decision on the $4 billion mine, it's also likely that it won't go ahead unless support from Australia's federal government is forthcoming. Specifically Adani wants close to $1 billion in loans from the government in order to build some 400 kms (240 miles) of new rail track to link the mine to the planned export port. Adani has already secured an undisclosed agreement with the Queensland state government that is believed to lower the burden of royalty payments, especially in the mine's early years of operation. Even if the federal government does lend the money, the Adani mine appears to be on somewhat shaky ground, given that its intended export market of India has a government with a stated policy goal of cutting coal imports to zero. While Australian governments have in the past assisted with infrastructure projects, the Adani mine was supposed to be proof that the private sector could pull off a major project with only supportive government regulation and not cash. There is still a good chance that the federal government will pony up the cash for Adani, given the ruling Liberal/National coalition has several pro-coal lawmakers and would like the credit from the jobs that will come with building the mine. But Carmichael may also be the last of its kind, given how prolonged and difficult its birth has been, with a well-funded environmental campaign against the mine and ongoing questions about its viability. It's hard to see any commercial bank being willing to fund a massively costly coal project in the future, given both the uncertainty over long-term demand and the negative publicity that is sure to be generated. But oddly enough, the travails of getting a new coal project off the ground probably makes the jostling over existing mines more likely, as companies seek to extract the last dollars available from coal's twilight.

The company is expected to release episodes in a traditional manner, instead of dropping an entire season in one go like Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc, WSJ reported. The company is also willing to share its viewership data with Hollywood, the report said.

He went to Ukraine and hired 120 people to develop mobile apps and web platforms for international clients and smaller Israeli startups.  I worked for years in the Israeli market and I knew what the costs were in Israel and I knew there was a shortage of workers,  he told Reuters. Driven by startups, Israel's technology industry is the fastest growing part of the economy. It accounts for 14 percent of economic output and 50 percent of exports.  But a shortage of workers means its position at the cutting edge of global technology is at risk, with consequences for the economy and employment. The government's Innovation Authority forecasts a shortage of 10,000 engineers and programmers over the next decade in a market that employs 140,000. Israel has dropped six spots in three years to 17th in the World Economic Forum's ranking of the ease of finding skilled technology employees. The shortage is particularly painful for Israel's 5,000 startups which compete for talent with development centers of technology giants such as Google, Intel, Microsoft and Apple. They offer big incentives that a startup cannot afford. Israel will lose its edge if the shortage isn't tackled, said Noa Acker, head of policy at the societal challenges division at the Innovation Authority.  Salaries will be very high and the industry will shrink to only very high level R&D; while much of the work will be exported,  she said.  Maths Lessons, Boot Camps The main reason for the shortfall is a sharp drop in the number of computer science, maths and statistics graduates, down from a peak of 3,000 in 2005 to a low of 1,600 in 2008. This is partly due to problems in secondary and primary schools where lack of funding means some classrooms do not have computers and advanced maths teachers are in short supply.  Why do we still have classes where there are no computers?  said Yifat Turbiner, a researcher in entrepreneurship and innovation at Ben-Gurion University.  If more budgets aren't allocated to generate a technological state of mind ... from elementary school, I believe all industries will suffer, not just high-tech.  Another reason for the shortage of computer science graduates is that after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000 many Israeli high tech workers lost their jobs, Acker said. This meant that students lost interest in tech careers and university applications declined. FILE PHOTO: Employees work at website-designer firm Wix.com offices in Tel Aviv, Israel July 4, 2016.Baz Ratner/File PhotoThe Education Ministry has announced plans to boost studies of maths and science, especially in high-schools outside the cities where advanced classes are not always available. But Turbiner said initiatives are also needed for a higher standard of maths at a younger age including training more teachers. The government also has long-term initiatives to integrate ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arabs -- two fast-growing segments of the population with low labor participation -- into the industry.  Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up about 11 percent of the population and many prioritize religious studies over science and maths.  Military technology expertise gained by soldiers during their service has been behind several successful Israeli firms including the country’s biggest tech company, Check Point Software Technologies. The government is also running  boot camps  of up to 18 months to train tech workers without technology degrees. Slideshow (12 Images)Good Connections While the government takes steps to stimulate organic growth of workers at home, it is also making changes to visas for a quick fix of importing foreign workers.  The government is preparing 500 visas for students from abroad who studied science and engineering at Israeli universities so they can stay to work at tech firms for a year. It is also working on easing bureaucratic hurdles to unlimited “expert visas”.  In the meantime, many Israeli startups are looking abroad. Ukraine is the top destination with about 100 Israeli development centers. A strong tradition of maths and computer science teaching that is present in many countries in former Soviet Union countries means Ukraine has more than 20,000 IT graduates each year. The 1990s arrival of a million immigrants from former Soviet countries, many of them scientists who went to work for technology companies, has also created strong ties. Israeli companies have also recruited workers in other eastern European countries such as Poland and Bulgaria.  Wix.com, which helps small businesses build websites and is one of Israel's hottest tech companies, employs 120 workers in two development centers in Ukraine and another 80 at a site in Lithuania.  They are in the same time zone, they have a good level of English and all are Russian speakers. Some of our people here are former Russians,  said Boaz Inbal, general manager of Wix's development centers.  We have direct flights to both countries. It's easy for us to collaborate and communicate.  Salaries for software developers in Ukraine are about 40 percent lower than in Israel, said Andrey Link, an executive vice president at Ukrainian software engineering firm Infopulse.  But he said:  The key argument in our favor is not the cost but availability. To find 2-3 people (in Israel) is not a problem, but if they need...an R&D; center for 100 people, it is very difficult in Israel.

Vingroup JSC climbed 1.3 percent, while Vietnam National Petroleum Group gained 1 percent.       We observe that the money flow in the stock market is quite strong at the moment,  said Tran Minh Hoang, chief economist of Vietcombank Securities.

If we delay too long, the economy will eventually overheat, causing inflation or some other problem,  San Francisco Fed President John Williams said in remarks prepared for delivery to the University of Technology Sydney.  Gradually raising interest rates to bring monetary policy back to normal helps us keep the economy growing at a rate that can be sustained for a longer time.   The Fed earlier this month raised interest rates a second time this year, and signaled it plans to raise them once more in 2017 and three times in 2018. But with inflation recently weakening and economic growth stuck at 2 percent, traders have been betting the Fed will end up going much more slowly. On Monday, Williams appeared keen to reset those expectations. Like Fed Chair Janet Yellen, Williams said he believes recent weak inflation readings will be transitory, and forecast a return to 2-percent inflation by next year.  Meanwhile, Williams said, labor markets will continue to strengthen, with the U.S. unemployment rate, now at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, likely to fall further and stay a little above 4 percent through next year.   The very strong labor market actually carries with it the risk of the economy exceeding its safe speed limit and overheating, which could eventually undermine the sustainability of the expansion,  Williams said.  My goal is to keep the economic expansion on a sound footing that can be sustained for as long as possible.   Williams reiterated the Fed's plans to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet this year, and promised the Fed will normalize policy in a well-telegraphed, gradual manner so as to reduce unnecessary market disruption both at home and abroad.     The more public understanding, the less chance that (the Fed's) actions will fuel unnecessarily volatility in the markets,  Williams said.

There are some ferocious beasts amongst them,  said the sex worker, a tall woman in her late thirties, wearing a short black dress and sporting a neck-length wig of straight dark hair.  Some men get violent... sometimes they attack you.  We deal with it as Cameroonian women do. We are strong,  Rose told the Thomson Reuters Foundation outside a brothel in Emombo, an area known for high rates of crime and prostitution. Despite the frequent insults, threats and attacks, sex workers such as Rose are helping to save the lives of their clients from the Central African nation's biggest killer - HIV. Prostitutes are persuading these men to take free HIV tests in mobile clinics, set up inside or nearby brothels and run by teams of doctors, nurses, social workers and lab technicians, in a drive to tackle the prevalence of the virus which causes AIDS. Cameroon has the second highest HIV rate in West and Central Africa, after Nigeria, says the U.N. AIDS programme (UNAIDS). While an average of one in 25 people across the country are living with HIV, more then a third of sex workers are infected, meaning they hold the key to halting the spread of the virus which kills at least 30,000 Cameroonians a year, experts say. People who buy sex have in the past proved hard to reach with anti-HIV efforts due to the stigma surrounding the virus and the fact that prostitution is illegal in Cameroon. Yet thousands of men in Yaounde have been convinced by sex workers to get tested since last October in a project run by CARE International and local partners such as Horizons Femmes.  No one would tell you officially: 'I'm a client of a sex worker' - people hide these kinds of things,  said Flavien Ndonko of CARE, explaining how HIV would then quickly spread undetected through networks of sex workers and their clients.  Now, we are going directly to the place where the sex is taking the place,  added the HIV/AIDS senior technical adviser.  Denial, or Something Worse  On a Friday evening in a narrow alleyway in Emombo, a queue is forming outside the brothel where Rose works - a dilapidated wooden shack where rooms contain nothing but a rolled-up rotting mattress and a rusty nail banged into the doorframe for a lock. These men are not waiting for sex, but to be tested for HIV.  You need to talk to them gently,  said Rose.  Some men don't like it. They say: 'No, no, I don't have the money for it' and I tell them : 'No, it is already paid for, it is free'.  Sex workers get paid a small fee for each client they refer - 500 CFA francs ($0.85) - and get tested at the same time. The test takes about 15 minutes, during which time the medical team explains the procedure and the health risks associated with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.  When the test is negative, they're relieved,  said psychosocial worker Doreen Mongo, sitting in one of several brothel rooms rented for the night by the health workers. Those who test positive for HIV are given an appointment in a health centre, through which parents are prescribed a course of drugs, and are offered counselling and follow-up sessions.  When it's positive, it's either denial or something worse,  Mongo added. Some of her fellow health workers said they felt vulnerable being tucked away in a flimsy shack, with little to no security, and having to deal with rowdy, drunken, clients. One of the medical team said her handbag was stolen while at work, and another had her identity card taken from the brothel. To improve security for the sex workers and health staff, Horizons Femmes has enlisted community leaders, known locally as 'gatekeepers', to help maintain order and peace in the area.  They make the area safer for us, they watch out for us,  said Roseline Waseem of Horizons Femmes. Beyond Sex Workers More than 5,000 clients of sex workers have been tested for HIV so far this year as part of the project, which is funded by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and believed to be the first of its kind in West and Central Africa. The results are so promising that Ndonko of CARE plans to present the programme and its results at the world's biggest annual AIDS conference, which takes place in Paris next month. Civil society groups in Cameroon are also going beyond sex workers and their clients, and are working to improve HIV prevention efforts and healthcare for men who have sex with men (MSM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. Almost a quarter of MSM in Yaounde, and two in five in Douala, the economic capital, are living with the virus, according to the state's national AIDS control committee. Yet fear of discrimination and the threat of up to five years in prison are driving MSM and LGBT people away from hospitals and state HIV programmes, activists say.  (In the past), it was really difficult for MSM to just walk into a health facility and consult a doctor because they were scared that even the doctor may just call the police,  said Carrine Angumua, CARE's national coordinator for HIV prevention. But the government has strived in recent years to reduce the number of new infections, by making antiretroviral treatment free, while sex workers, LGBT people and MSM are now part of the country's national HIV strategy.  This is a major step... access to health is a human right,  added Angumua.  That's the platform on which we are working.

The price set a record for a Disney map and was among the highest ever paid for a piece of Disney ephemera at auction, organizers said. Still, it fell short of the predicted $900,000.  After some pretty exciting bidding, the map sold for $708,000, making it the most expensive Disneyland map ever sold,  said Mike Van Eaton, co-owner of Van Eaton Galleries.  We are beyond thrilled that the map will continue to be appreciated and cherished just like it has been for all these years,  he said. The buyer was not revealed. The map was one of the highlights of some 700 lots at the  Collecting Disney  auction, held by Van Eaton Galleries in Los Angeles. The sale of items drawn mostly from private collections was expected take in between $2 million and $3 million. Disney co-founded an animation studio in 1923, which eventually grew into a feature film production studio with films such as  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,   Bambi  and  Cinderella.  He died in 1966 aged 65. The Walt Disney Company is now one of Hollywood's top players, producing live action and animated feature fare.

The case prompted Crown, the world's biggest listed casino company outside of China, to retreat from global expansion plans and sell off assets in China's gambling hub Macau, and instead shift its focus back home. The Australian consul general in Shanghai, Graeme Meehan, earlier told reporters outside the Baoshan District Court that Crown's head of international VIP gambling Jason O'Connor was given a ten month sentence. The two other Australians, Jane Pan and Jerry Xuan, were handed nine month sentences. A total of 19 defendants, also including one Malaysian citizen, were formally charged earlier this month, having been first detained late last year. Zhai Jian, a defence lawyer, said the defendants had pled guilty.

Crown remains respectful of the sovereign jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China,  the firm added. Gambling Crackdown The logo of Australian casino giant Crown Resorts Ltd adorns the hotel and casino complex in Melbourne, Australia, June 13, 2017.Jason ReedAt the end of the swift trial that only began on Monday morning, relatives and lawyers were whisked away. Journalists had been barred from attending the proceedings. The husband of one defendant told Reuters after the trial the outcome was better than he had hoped. Requesting anonymity, he said his wife was given a nine month sentence and would be released on July 14. Donald Rothwell, a professor of international law at the Australian National University, said the guilty pleas had helped the employees avoid longer sentences, though added the case did underline legal risks of doing business in the country.  The case was part of a wider crackdown on gambling in China. Crown does not directly run casinos in China, but last month it sold its remaining stake in Macau-focused Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd for $1.16 billion. The company had also been engaged in a big push to lure Chinese gamblers to its Australian operations. Aside from pulling out of the Macau, Crown has quit an agreement to develop a casino in Las Vegas and cancelled an ambitious plan, which it floated before the arrests, to split into three separate companies - one of which would have included its offshore assets. China has been cracking down on attempts by casinos to woo high-spending Chinese gamblers within China. In 2015 thirteen South Korean casino managers were arrested in China for offering Chinese gamblers free tours, free hotels and sexual services. The trial is the latest in a series of high-profile cases in China involving foreign firms. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline PLC was fined nearly $500 million in 2014 and food maker OSI saw employees jailed last year.

LOUIS -- For 5 1/2 innings Sunday night, it looked like more of the same for the St. Louis Cardinals. Mistake pitches, untimely errors and not enough offense against a 2-6 starter put them in a two-run hole and in danger of being swept at home by the Pittsburgh Pirates for the first time in 20 years. However, Randal Grichuk provided a monstrous power surge, Trevor Rosenthal threw three big pitches to extinguish a seventh-inning rally, and Pittsburgh offered plenty of help in the Cardinals' half of the seventh. It all added up to an 8-4 St. Louis win that snapped a three-game losing streak and capped a day in which the Cardinals churned nearly a quarter of their roster, mostly because of injury-related moves.  We take it however we can get it,  St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said.  We had good situational hitting tonight, and we stacked hits together.  That was particularly true in the sixth and seventh innings, when the Cardinals (34-40) erased their deficit against Chad Kuhl and three relievers who couldn't get the big outs to keep the game within reach. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at CardinalsPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchGrichuk, recalled from recalled Triple-A Memphis before the game, led off the sixth with the second-longest homer in Busch Stadium III history, a 478-foot rocket that landed halfway up the third deck in left field. His fifth homer of the year sliced Pittsburgh's lead to 4-3. Kuhl left after Yadier Molina doubled to left-center. Tony Watson got two quick outs, but pinch hitter Jedd Gyorko laced a ground-rule double to right-center that tied the score. The Pirates (35-41) pushed the tiebreaking run to third with two outs in the seventh. Elias Diaz singled and moved around the bases on two infield outs. Matheny hooked Matt Bowman and went with Rosenthal to face Josh Harrison, who was 3-for-4 against Bowman but 0-for-8 when facing Rosenthal. Three blazing fastballs later, Harrison was 0-for-9 and the game remained tied.  We had a short sample with Bowman and a little bit more with Rosenthal,  Matheny said of the move.  To me, that was a big moment in that game.  In contrast to Rosenthal (2-3), whose roughly 90 seconds of work earned him a win, Pittsburgh relievers Juan Nicasio (1-4) and Jhan Marinez made a mess out of the inning's bottom half. Nicasio walked Tommy Pham and Stephen Piscotty to start the inning. After Grichuk fanned, Molina, who wasn't in the original lineup but was inserted into an amended one about two hours before first pitch, poked a tiebreaking single into right for his third hit of the night. Shortstop Jordy Mercer booted Aledmys Diaz's grounder to score Piscotty for a 6-4 lead. Marinez relieved Nicasio, wild-pitched the runners to second and third, then coughed up a two-run single to Paul DeJong past a drawn-in Mercer.  We weren't able to make pitches,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  We weren't able to execute the fastball for the most part or the slider. Just too many pitches when you get up to 30 pitches, and the two walks painted (Nicasio) in a bad corner.  The game's one remaining moment of suspense occurred two batters after DeJong's hit. St. Louis-area native Luke Voit, one of three call-ups from Memphis, made his major league debut as a pinch hitter. With most of the audience of 43,719 chanting his first name, Voit ran the count full and then was drilled by a 96 mph fastball in the back. As he jogged to first, a national TV audience saw his parents pump their fists in the air in joy.  I didn't feel it,  a grinning Voit said.  Honestly, I was smiling going down to first base.  Kuhl permitted eight hits and four runs in five-plus innings, walking one and fanning six. Cardinals starter Mike Leake also got a no-decision after going six innings and giving up six hits and four runs, three of them earned. He walked two and struck out two. Adam Frazier lined a two-run triple in a three-run third for Pittsburgh, which finished a seven-game road trip at 4-3. NOTES: St. Louis CF Dexter Fowler (right heel spur) and LHP Kevin Siegrist (cervical spine strain) each landed on the 10-day disabled list Sunday. 1B Luke Voit and RHP Mike Mayers were called up from Triple-A Memphis. The Cardinals also optioned OF Chad Huffman to Memphis. ... Pittsburgh 2B Josh Harrison was hit by a pitch Saturday, the major-league-leading 16th time he took first base with a bruise for his trouble. He has been hit five times in the last seven games.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-pirates-cardinals-writethru-idUSMTZED6Q4Y3IAF"},

In pouring rain, the 18-year-old upset members of Japan's Olympic silver medal-winning 4x100 meters relay team to win the 100m in a personal best 10.05 seconds in Osaka on Saturday. On Sunday, he ran a personal best 20.32 seconds to seal the 200m, two years after making the semi-finals at the world championships in Beijing. No Japanese sprinter has ever broken the 10-second barrier in the 100m, with Koji Ito coming closest when he ran 10 seconds flat in 1998. But former junior 100 and 200m world champion Sani Brown is emerging as the man most likely and will be keen to test the barrier in London in August.  Even I'm surprised,  said Sani Brown of his weekend.  I didn't know I could run like this. I hope I get the chance to compete against top sprinters and break the 10-second barrier.  Born to a Ghanian father and Japanese mother, Sani Brown became the first to complete the national sprint double since Shingo Suetsugu's 2003 sweep. Injury robbed the 2015 IAAF 'Rising Star of the Year' of a run at the Rio Olympics, where the 4x100m relay team shot to national fame after winning silver behind Usain Bolt's Jamaica. Having graduated from high school in March, Sani Brown is now training in the Netherlands with Rana Reider and will move to the United States after enrolling with the University of Florida.  I think there's a difference in the way coaches work in Japan and the way the top coaches in the world work,  the 1.88m (6ft-2in) Sani Brown said in comments published by Kyodo on Monday.  I've done a lot of weight training which has strengthened my core, and that's stabilized my upper body when I run.  Ito, now a high performance chief at Japan's athletics federation, said the sprinter had the nous of a seasoned campaigner.  Like Carl Lewis or Bolt, he has the ability to rein it in until 60 or 70 meters before letting it all go, and that is a quality not everyone has,  Ito told Kyodo. Sani Brown's biggest test may be coping with the hype when he lines up at London. Goal-setting is unlikely to be a problem.  I'm very happy about being number one in Japan, but I don't want to settle for this,  he told Kyodo.  I want to do well at the world championships and other competitions I've got ahead of me.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index rose 0.2 percent or 10.13 points to 5,726.00 by 0327 GMT. The benchmark rose 0.2 percent higher on Friday. Consumer non-cyclicals gained the most with Metcash Ltd jumping as much as 9.1 percent to its highest in nearly three months. Metcash posted its biggest intraday percentage gain in 10 months after reporting a 9.3 percent rise in underlying annual profit and announcing plans to resume dividend payments. Retailers Woolworths Ltd and Wesfarmers Ltd were among the top gainers rising 1.2 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. In other stocks, miners were on track to record a third session of gains on the back of oil and gold prices which rose on Friday helped by a weaker dollar. South32 Ltd climbed 1.4 percent while Rio Tinto Ltd added 0.9 percent. The financial sector drifted as concerns over the federal government's proposed bank levy and some states' interest in adding levies of their own persisted. Australia's decision to impose a A$6.2 billion tax on the five biggest banks has created uncertainty among global investors who no longer see the country as a stable investment destination, according to the chief executive of National Australia Bank. National Australia Bank Ltd and Westpac Banking Corp shed 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent while Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd gained marginally. A second Australian state on Friday said it was open to charging its own bank tax. Insurer QBE was the biggest loser on the benchmark after it shed 2.5 percent to its lowest in over six months, while retirement community developer/operator Aveo Group slumped to its lowest in nearly 2 years. Aveo fell as much as 10.5 percent after media reports of alleged customer exploitation. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index climbed 0.5 percent or 35.14 points to 7,588.78. Telecommunications stocks led the gains on the index with Spark New Zealand Ltd rising 2.1 percent. Consumer discretionary was in the red after SKY Network Television Ltd fell as much as 5 percent to its lowest in over eight years. The pay television provider terminated a sales agreement to buy Vodafone's local unit.

The 30-year yield was 1.5 basis points higher at 0.810 percent. The yield had declined to 0.780 percent on Wednesday, its lowest since late April, as JGBs tracked last week's yield flattening in the U.S. Treasury market. But the fall by super long JGB yields stalled late last week after results of the Bank of Japan's debt-buying operation showed that investor demand for the maturities had peaked following several days of price gains. Price losses were limited mainly to the super longs, with the benchmark 10-year yield standing unchanged at 0.050 percent. The 10-year/30-year yield spread steepened to 76 basis points from Thursday's 73 basis points, which was its flattest since January.

Some lenders are worried about a squeeze on their profit margin, but the number of them has fallen since the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the 184 mortgage executives who responded to the survey. In a response to a tougher climate, more lenders said they plan to relax their lending standards, which could attract more borrowers, survey data showed. “Expectations to ease credit standards climbed to survey highpoints in the second quarter as more lenders reported slowing mortgage demand and increasing concerns about competition from other lenders,” Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae's chief economist at Washington-based mortgage finance agency, said in a statement. The margin on the share of lenders who saw a drop in consumer demand for a loan to buy a home in the past three months over the share of lenders who saw a rise in purchase loan demand fell to about 30 percent, the lowest in two years on a year-over-year basis, Fannie Mae said. The net percentage of lenders which anticipate lower profit margin in the next three months stood at 6 points, down from 12 points in the first quarter and from 31 points in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net share of lenders which expect to ease credit standards rose to 15 points in the second quarter, up from about 3.5 points a year earlier. Fannie Mae's quarterly lender sentiment survey was launched in March 2014.
