He gestured at one wavering GOP lawmaker, Dean Heller of Nevada, saying, \u201cHe wants to remain a senator, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d and warned lawmakers not to leave town in August without a deal.Senate Republican leaders conceded defeat earlier this week on their effort to roll back and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, but at Mr. Trump\u2019s urging, they dug in Wednesday for what is expected to be the final push. Senate Republicans said they were hoping to rustle up 50 votes for a third version of the bill.Mr. Trump, telling the senators they were \u201cvery close\u201d to a deal, signaled the White House would take a more aggressive role in wrangling the 50 votes need to pass the bill. The GOP president suggested that Republicans had it easy in voting for the 2010 law\u2019s repeal when his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, was in office because they knew he would veto it and there would be no consequences.\u201cI\u2019m ready to act, I have pen in hand, believe me, I\u2019m sitting in that office. You\u2019ve never had that before,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cFor seven years, you\u2019ve had an easy rap: \u2018We\u2019ll repeal, we\u2019ll replace, and he\u2019s never going to sign it.\u2019 \u201dGOP leaders\u2019 immediate challenge is mustering 50 Republican lawmakers to approve a procedural motion that would allow debate to begin on their health-care bill.Adding to the uncertainty, Sen.       John McCain\u2019s       office disclosed late Wednesday that the Arizona Republican has been diagnosed with a type of brain tumor known as a glioblastoma, and that the timing of his return to the Senate would depend on consultations with his medical team.GOP senators said Wednesday night that the indefinite absence of Mr. McCain made their quest to get 50 votes on the health-care bill harder. \u201cThat does complicate things,\u201d said Sen.       Pat Toomey       (R., Pa.).Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said after the White House lunch that a vote on that motion would happen next week, regardless of whether it was expected to pass, and that he had \u201cevery expectation\u201d of trying to eke out a bill with majority support after that.\u201cI want to disabuse any of you of the notion that we will not have that vote next week,\u201d       Mr. McConnell       said.GOP leaders hope that once debate begins and senators offer a variety of amendments, a majority will emerge for some version. Earlier this week, three Republicans\u2014Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine,       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska and       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia\u2014said they would oppose the motion to proceed on a repeal-only bill. Unless one of them changes her mind, debate can\u2019t begin because Democrats are uniformly opposed.Among the amendments may be one to largely repeal the 2010 law without an immediate replacement. An estimate released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office found that such a move would leave 32 million more people uninsured and would double premiums by 2026, compared with current law. The measure would reduce federal deficits by $473 billion over the coming decade, the CBO estimated.About 20 GOP senators huddled for more than two hours Wednesday night, but it wasn\u2019t clear if they had gotten any closer to securing the needed 50 votes. \u201cHard to say,\u201d Mr. Toomey said upon leaving the meeting.White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus came to the meeting but was asked to stay in a room separate from the one where senators held their discussion because some lawmakers wanted to speak privately, an aide said.\u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re among ourselves,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.)Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), an opponent of the repeal-only plan, was noncommittal on her stance after the meeting. Ms. Capito, also an opponent of that approach, declined to comment on the meeting.The GOP currently holds 52 seats in the Senate, leaving it vulnerable to defections from conservatives, centrists or any senator with a home-state concern. Democrats have remained unified in their desire to preserve Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement.GOP leaders are faced in the days aheadwith finding ways to lure back at least some of the GOP senators who have said in recent days they couldn\u2019t support the latest version of a bill aimed at overhauling the nation\u2019s health-care system.Ms. Capito, for example, is among those who have protested the bill\u2019s cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. The administration is pushing the notion of waivers for states to redesign their Medicaid programs, including more support for low-income people. Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) said Wednesday senators had discussed the idea at lunch.Ms. Murkowski has similar concerns as well as a broader worry about her state\u2019s fragile insurance market. Mr. Trump cited the current struggles of Alaska\u2019s insurance markets as a reason for her to take action.Another holdout, Sen.       Mike Lee       (R., Utah), spoke with the president Tuesday, and Mr. Trump appeared open to the changes the senator wants, a spokesman for Mr. Lee said. A White House aide said the administration is open to any provision that increases GOP support for the bill.Mr. Lee has been especially concerned about alterations that were made to a provision of the GOP bill written by Sen.       Ted Cruz       (R., Texas), which was designed to lower premiums by allowing insurers to sell cheaper, less-comprehensive plans than allowed under current law.Similarly, GOP leaders have said they could address some of the concerns of Sen.       Jerry Moran       (R., Kan.) that the bill could negatively affect his state.Before this week, the president had been less active in the negotiations in the Senate than he was in helping pass health-care legislation in the House.The question is whether his late intervention can turn the tide. Some Republicans have been quietly skeptical of the president\u2019s arm\u2019s-length approach to Senate negotiations, though others have said he has been smart to hold back.\u201cDo the tectonic plates break and begin to move?\u201d said Sen.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.), after the meeting. \u201cI can tell you they weren\u2019t before that meeting. The fact that the president comes in and very much emphasizes the need for momentum can break those plates.\u201d\u201cWe are getting close -- the issues are narrowing,\u201d added Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), a conservative senator who has said his support for a GOP bill isn\u2019t guaranteed.\u201cThere is still a hope on behalf of the administration and a lot of senators too that we can get there,\u201d said Sen.       John Thune       (R., S.D.), a member of the chamber\u2019s leadership. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take one more shot at it.\u201dFor months, lobbyists, GOP strategists and White House officials have described the GOP health bill in vivid metaphors, ranging from the biblical resurrection of Lazarus to the bathtub scene in \u201cFatal Attraction,\u201d where an apparently vanquished villain roars back to life.Heading into this week, a senior White House official predicted, \u201cThis bill will have been declared dead once, and resurrected at least once.\u201d Officials also regularly cite the House\u2019s success in passing a health bill after legislation was initially pulled from the floor in March.Democrats, for their part, are seeking to use Mr. Trump\u2019s revival of the GOP push to draw fresh fuel for their campaigns.\u201cLike the armored and mummified White Walkers from Game of Thrones, Trumpcare is hard to kill,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) wrote Wednesday in a fundraising email. \u201cRepublicans continue reanimating their terrible bill to kick millions of Americans off of their health care\u2026 Chip in now and support my efforts to kill this bill once and for all!\u201dDemocrats also hammered senators such as Mr. Heller of Nevada and       Jeff Flake       of Arizona, who are facing re-election campaigns in 2018, over the prospect of Medicaid cuts.Among those warning of dire consequences if Republican senators don\u2019t repeal Obamacare is Republican National Committee chairwoman       Ronna McDaniel.       She wrote in an email to GOP donors and supporters Wednesday that \u201cwe could lose the midterm elections\u201d because \u201csome in the Senate are refusing to even put a simple repeal bill on [Mr. Trump\u2019s] desk.\u201dConservative groups also joined in, including the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political-action committee, whose head Ken Cuccinelli said Wednesday the group would hold Senate Republicans accountable if they failed to pass health-care legislation.In the Washington swamp decried by Mr. Trump, Mr. Cuccinelli said, \u201cMitch McConnell is the head alligator.\u201dSuch threats may have limited effect on some of the Republican dissenters. Ms. Collins and Ms. Capito don\u2019t face re-election until 2020, and Ms. Murkowski isn\u2019t up until 2022. Still, conservative activists said they hope to send a broader message to Republicans about the importance of sticking to their promises.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about these senators; it\u2019s about the state of the Republican party,\u201d said Rachael Slobodien, spokeswoman for the conservative Club for Growth. \u201cThis is a much bigger fight.\u201d\u2014Byron Tau, Siobhan Hughes and Janet Hook contributed to this article.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com, Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.comAppeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Urges Lawmakers To Finish Health Bill.'", "keywords": "affordable care act,congress,congressional republicans,health care,health exchanges,health insurance,health law,medicaid,mitch mcconnell,obamacare,senate,trump,Donald Trump,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,private health insurance"}, {"news_title": "Sen.

It is just a nasty, incurable disease.\u201dTreatments include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, Dr. Mayer said. Many of the people who have such cancer, he said, are able to get into a clinical trial that is searching for a cure.A large group of Senate Republicans learned of Mr. McCain\u2019s diagnosis while meeting Wednesday night about the health-care bill, leading to a moment of stunned silence, said Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.). Sen.

The Magnitsky Act is a 2012 U.S. law that punishes Russian officials accused of human-rights violations, and is named for Mr. Browder\u2019s lawyer, who died in a Russian jail in 2009.The testimony from the younger Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort is expected to focus in part on an email chain Mr. Trump released last week showing he helped arrange a Trump Tower meeting to discuss allegedly damaging information about former Democratic presidential nominee       Hillary Clinton.       The meeting was also attended by Messrs.

Mohammed bin Salman, known to many as \u201cMBS,\u201d knelt and kissed his older cousin\u2019s hand.At that point it would have been clear to Mohammed bin Nayef that his long career\u2014in which he had gained the trust of American intelligence officials and become a crucial figure in the U.S.-Saudi relationship\u2014was over, say people familiar with the royal court. \u201cWhen MBS kisses you,\u201d says one of these people, \u201cyou know something bad will happen.\u201dAfter the June 21 encounter between the two princes, the royal court announced Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s elevation. Mohammed bin Nayef disappeared from public view. He has been at his Jeddah palace with his movements restricted, say those people, overseen by guards loyal to Mohammed bin Salman.A royal-court official, in a written response to questions about the shuffle, said Mohammed bin Nayef was \u201cdeposed.\u201d\u201cThe reasons of his deposition are very confidential and no one has the right to disclose them,\u201d he said, adding that the decision to do so \u201cwas for the sake of the national interest.\u201d The former crown prince has daily visitors, he said, \u201cand has visited the king and the crown prince more than once.\u201dThe younger prince\u2019s ascent marks a reordering of power with profound implications for one of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most secretive countries. With King Salman ailing, the new crown prince could soon be in charge of one of the world\u2019s last remaining absolute monarchies, a kingdom that ranks among the planet\u2019s largest oil producers and importers of arms, and that uses its vast resources to boost its sway in the Middle East.Saudi Arabian succession is governed by a malleable set of rules and family customs, and involves input from a council of about 35 top princes representing descendants of the kingdom\u2019s founder. The June 21 move amounted to one faction\u2019s deposing of another, in the most jolting succession fight since King Saud was forced from the throne by his brothers 53 years ago.That has left some royal-court insiders concerned about further upheaval, worrying another group could plot a move, say some of the people familiar with the royal court. \u201cNow it\u2019s the precedent,\u201d one of them says.The royal-court official declined to make Mohammed bin Salman available for comment and said Mohammed bin Nayef declined to comment.Mohammed bin Salman in recent years has made bold promises of change, pledging to modernize and open Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy and culture. His plan focuses on listing shares in the state-owned oil company on a public exchange and investing the proceeds to diversify the economy. He has also taken an aggressive approach to foreign policy and has worked to form close ties with the Trump White House.His older cousin is a low-key official who has made relatively few public appearances and has followed a slow-moving approach to governance over the years. He had widespread support among older Saudi princes who have backed his more conservative approach to foreign affairs. Through his years of working on antiterrorism initiatives, he had longstanding relationships with career U.S. security officials who have sometimes been at odds with the current White House.Some Saudis and Saudi watchers have expressed hope that economic liberalization will lead to more political and cultural liberalization, and that Mohammed bin Salman will emerge as a force for such change. His planned economic overhaul includes a push to bring more women into the workforce and improve education levels.Discord between the two princes stretched back to 2015, in the early part of King Salman\u2019s reign, when he made Mohammed bin Nayef crown prince and installed his own son, Mohammed bin Salman, as deputy crown prince. King Salman\u2019s later moves to give his son power over foreign affairs, the military and the economy fueled speculation the king could move him up in the succession order.A debate over how to handle the confrontation with Qatar that began in June, over accusations by Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries that the Persian Gulf neighbor supported terrorism, among other factors, heightened the sense of urgency over the rift between the princes, say several of the people familiar with the royal court. The older wanted a diplomatic solution rather than economic coercion and threats of violence, say some of the people familiar with the royal court. The younger adopted a more hawkish stance, supporting the economic blockade of Qatar that prevailed and remains in place.\u201cMohammed bin Nayef did not oppose any measures taken against Qatar,\u201d the royal-court official said.King Salman\u2019s deteriorating health fed concerns in Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s camp that time was growing short, say some of the people familiar with the royal court. The young prince began to lobby his father to choose him as successor.\u201cThe King\u2019s health is excellent,\u201d the royal-court official said of the 81-year-old monarch. \u201cHe performs his daily, varied routines in an active and energetic manner. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the King is a King until death.\u201dThe royal court recorded a video in recent weeks in which the king says it is time for Mohammed bin Salman to become king, say several of the people familiar with the royal court. They say the unpublished video could be used upon the king\u2019s death or as a public abdication announcement.The royal-court official, without directly addressing the video, said: \u201cAny country that abandons its leader in his last days for a critical health condition is a country with no dignity and prestige.\u201dAs the young prince laid his plan, he notified the Trump administration. The week before the power shuffle, say several of the people familiar with the royal court, Mohammed bin Salman dispatched a young official named Turki al Sheikh to Washington.President Donald Trump had met Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh and Washington in recent months. Mr. al Sheikh, a poet and writer of patriotic songs with no foreign-policy experience, had been moved by Mohammed bin Salman recently to a prominent role in the royal court.On his June trip to Washington, Mr. al Sheikh notified the White House that Mohammed bin Salman was ready to oust his older cousin, say these people.A White House official, referring to the Saudi leadership change, said the U.S. government \u201csought not to intervene or to be seen as intervening in such a sensitive internal matter,\u201d and \u201cwe consistently stressed our desire to maintain cooperation\u201d with Saudi leadership.The royal-court official said: \u201cWith regard to Minister Turki Al-Sheikh, he did not meet any U.S. official at all. Neither the U.S. nor any other country has been directly or indirectly informed about the matter, for this is an absolute sovereign matter.\u201dMohammed bin Salman\u2019s plan began playing out soon after Mr. al Sheikh returned to Saudi Arabia, in a drama described to The Wall Street Journal by people familiar with the royal court.On June 20, Mohammed bin Nayef was getting ready for a relaxed Eid, the big celebration at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. He headed that night to the palace in Mecca for a routine gathering of senior officials.For months, he had known his cousin could move against him. Within the three weeks leading up to Eid, people close to Mohammed bin Nayef warned him that Mohammad bin Salman was likely preparing to oust him. But, Mohammed bin Nayef dismissed their concerns as conspiracy theories.Mohammed bin Nayef \u201cthought why do it now, because it was the last three days before Eid,\u201d says one of the people familiar with the royal court.Guards loyal to Mohammed bin Nayef were replaced by others loyal to Mohammed bin Salman. The royal-court official said this was normal procedure and that additional royal guards have been assigned to the older prince, adding that they don\u2019t control his movements.Mecca\u2019s black-and-white Al Safa palace looms about 10 stories over the Kabaa, Islam\u2019s holiest site. Videos show that when the king and his entourage are present, as they were June 20, its carpeted meeting rooms buzz with ministers, staffers and servers carrying trays of coffee to dignitaries in green velour armchairs.The crown prince wasn\u2019t set to arrive at the palace until nighttime, after Tarwieh prayers\u2014an hour when many gatherings of high-level officials happen in the scorching Saudi summer. After dark, Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s motorcade set out for the palace through Mecca\u2019s busy streets.When he arrived at the palace that evening, he was told to proceed alone, without his security detail.\u201cOnce he went from one room to another they took the weapons, the phones, everything from everyone\u201d in his entourage, says one of the people familiar with the royal court.Guards ushered Mohammed bin Nayef upstairs, through the palace\u2019s flower-patterned hallways to a small lounge. They closed the doors, leaving him alone. It was close to midnight by then, and the crown prince wouldn\u2019t leave until morning.While Mohammed bin Nayef waited, Mohammed bin Salman had calls put out to members of the Allegiance Council, the group of about 35 sons and grandsons of the kingdom\u2019s founder who weigh in on leadership structure. They were told the king wanted Mohammed bin Salman to be crown prince and asked for their support. The Saudi government says 31 members approved.In that room, Mohammed bin Nayef was told of his fate: The kingdom\u2019s senior princes wanted his cousin as crown prince.Mohammed bin Nayef \u201cwas horrified,\u201d says one of the people familiar with the royal court. He was asked to sign a resignation letter and a pledge of loyalty to Mohammed bin Salman, this person says. The crown prince resisted.Over the next several hours, royal-court officials visited him, urging him to reconsider. An emissary from the king told him to sign the resignation letter or face serious consequences.Mohammed bin Nayef held firm. But by dawn he was exhausted. He knew there was no way out. He made the only compromise he could\u2014he agreed to give an oral pledge of allegiance.The royal-court official said: \u201cThe pledge of allegiance made to the Crown Prince was made willingly.\u201dIt was about 7 a.m. when Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s men let the crown prince out. Mohammed bin Nayef didn\u2019t expect to confront the man taking over his title immediately.After exiting the room, though, he was surprised to hear a crowd. He walked from the corridor to the marble-walled room and saw video cameras and photographers. A guard\u2014not one of his\u2014stood with his hand on a holstered gun, in what people familiar with the royal court\u2019s traditions say is a violation of protocol around the crown prince.Then he saw Mohammed bin Salman coming quickly toward him.

Then a guard wrapped a black cloak around Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s shoulders and led him off to his Jeddah palace.Write to Justin Scheck at justin.scheck@wsj.com, Shane Harris at shane.harris@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.comAppeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition as 'Saudi Royal Drama Was Sealed With a Kiss.'", "keywords": " crown prince,saudi arabia, saudi royal family,political,general news,royal families,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets"}, {"news_title": "Investors Brace for Clues on ECB Tapering", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-brace-for-clues-on-ecb-tapering-1500523201", "news_time": "2017-07-20 00:00:00", "content": "The European Central Bank is preparing to close off the money taps, and global investors are on the edge of their seats.Financial markets seesawed last month after ECB President       Mario Draghi       signaled that the bank might soon scale back its \u20ac60 billion ($69.3 billion) a month bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, as the eurozone economy accelerates.Mr. Draghi has a chance to expand on that idea on Thursday, when he faces the cameras after the ECB\u2019s policy meeting. Investors will watch closely for hints as to the bank\u2019s moves after December, when QE is currently due to end. The details of the ECB\u2019s exit strategy matter hugely for asset prices, interest rates and the euro currency.Here are key questions ahead of the central bank\u2019s policy release, due at 1145 GMT (7:45 a.m. EDT).Taper tips. According to Mr. Draghi, ECB officials haven\u2019t yet discussed winding down, or tapering, their bond purchases. If a first discussion took place this week, that would be a strong signal that an announcement on tapering QE is imminent\u2014perhaps after the ECB\u2019s next policy meeting on Sept. 7. Concrete details will probably have to wait, however. Mr. Draghi is also likely to soothe markets by emphasizing that any policy change will be gradual.It is in its best shape since before the financial crisis. After outpacing the U.S. in the first quarter, the bloc\u2019s economy might have grown by 3% on an annualized basis in the three months to June\u2014the fastest pace in around a decade. Unemployment is falling, and consumer and business sentiment indicators are at multiyear highs.Because the indicator that the ECB actually targets\u2014inflation\u2014is still too weak. Policy makers don\u2019t fully understand why strong growth has yet to feed through to consumer prices, which rose only 1.3% on the year last month. But in a crucial shift, Mr. Draghi has suggested that ECB officials may be willing to overlook that weakness because they are confident that inflation will pick up over time.Mr. Draghi might announce an internal review into different exit strategies. The most obvious plan would be to reduce QE by \u20ac10 billion a month from January, following the example of the Federal Reserve, but many analysts expect staggered \u20ac20 billion reductions at three-month intervals. The ECB chief might also clarify how soon interest rates will rise after the end of QE. And the ECB might drop its pledge to accelerate QE if the economic outlook darkens, though that is unclear.A lot. Officials are wary of repeating the Fed\u2019s policy error four years ago, when it triggered a \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d in financial markets by signaling the end of its own QE program. A surge in interest rates and the value of the euro could stop the region\u2019s long-awaited recovery in its tracks. That is why Mr. Draghi is expected to stress the need for patience and prudence.Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com", "keywords": " asset purchases, draghi,ecb, ecb qe, ecb stimulus, european central bank, mario draghi, qe,European Central Bank,Mario Draghi,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"news_title": "Morgan Stanley, Goldman Earnings Highlight Firms\u2019 Diverging Paths Since Crisis", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanleys-earnings-revenue-beat-expectations-1500462061", "news_time": "2017-07-19 21:35:00", "content": "Morgan Stanley        MS 3.28%       in 2009 was worth $50 billion less than its longtime rival,             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       After reporting strong earnings on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley has nearly closed that gap.The surprising turnabout between the two rivals shows just how much has changed on Wall Street since the financial crisis: Boring is beating swashbuckling. \u200bGoldman\u2019s strengths\u2014making market bets and serving hedge funds\u2014have been zapped by new regulations and investors\u2019 aversion to risk. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has cut traders and trained those who remain to take fewer risks, while adding to businesses that make money reliably and aren\u2019t penalized by capital rules.The quarter was challenging for the industry as trading sputtered and loan growth stalled in spots. All six of the big banks beat analysts\u2019 earnings expectations, but they sometimes required the help of noncore businesses such as private investing. Shares of             Bank of America Corp.       fell after its earnings release on Tuesday as investors fretted about net interest income falling from the first quarter due in part to lower long-term bond yields. And J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., while reporting record profit, trimmed its outlook for the second half.Morgan Stanley\u2019s results had no such caveats, with contributions spread evenly among its traders, investment bankers and stockbrokers.It has been a remarkable run for the bank and its chief executive, James Gorman, who in 2010 took the reins of a firm humbled by the financial crisis and strategically adrift. His decision to de-emphasize trading and embrace wealth management\u2014a business he once ran for Morgan Stanley\u2014has paid off, producing steady growth and winning over investors who had stayed away after repeated burns.\u201cThese changes don\u2019t happen quickly, they happen over many years,\u201d Mr. Gorman said Wednesday in an interview. \u201cMuch of it came together in this quarter. I wouldn\u2019t run a victory lap around it yet, but this is proof of the model.\u201dMorgan Stanley\u2019s shares rose 3.3%, bringing the firm\u2019s market value to $86.2 billion, compared with Goldman\u2019s $87.7 billion. Also contributing to the narrowing gap this week was a sharp drop in trading reported by Goldman on Tuesday.In some ways, both firms aren\u2019t the top players they once were. The two are now eclipsed in trading revenue by J.P. Morgan,             Citigroup Inc.       and Bank of America, which have used their sheer size to dominate the new high-volume, low-margin trading landscape.But Goldman and Morgan Stanley are old rivals. They spent decades dueling as private partnerships and came through the financial crisis as the only two large stand-alone investment banks to survive. But Goldman emerged stronger and stuck to the strategy that made it the most envied trader on Wall Street, even while peers like J.P. Morgan and Bank of America bulked up.Morgan Stanley decided it had to evolve, buying Citigroup Inc.\u2019s Smith Barney brokerage and slashing trading businesses. The firm didn\u2019t catch up to Goldman quickly, slowly closing the gap first in revenue and then in profitability.For the quarter, Morgan Stanley reported a profit of $1.8 billion on revenue of $9.5 billion, both up from the year-earlier period and better than analysts had expected.While the second half of the year may prove tougher, the first half has been a validation of Mr. Gorman\u2019s reshaping of a firm he joined relatively late in his career. A former management consultant brought over from Merrill Lynch in 2006 to run wealth management, he ascended to the corner office after the crisis humbled Morgan Stanley\u2019s trading desks, and then-CEO       John Mack,        a former bond salesman, retired.In 2009, Mr. Mack and Mr. Gorman struck the deal to buy Smith Barney. The purchase added heft to Morgan Stanley\u2019s wealth-management business, which remained hobbled after a tumultuous 1997 merger with Dean Witter. In 2009, the business made a profit of about $380 million. This year, it is on track for $4 billion, with remarkably steady revenue. On 98% of trading days in 2015, the unit brought in between $50 million and $70 million.That predictability is an antidote to more-volatile trading business, which the firm has been shrinking. Last year, Mr. Gorman and top lieutenant       Colm Kelleher,        a former trading chief, fired 25% of fixed-income traders and slashed the capital available to the unit for bets.Still, that division\u2014which trades everything from corporate bonds to oil to interest-rate swaps\u2014has kept revenue from falling sharply. It has made more than $1 billion in revenue for five straight quarters, hitting a goal Mr. Gorman set last year.On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley reported $1.2 billion in revenue from the division, outperforming Goldman for the second straight quarter thanks to strong trading in currencies and corporate debt.Including Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock traders, the firm reported trading revenue for the quarter of $3.2 billion compared with Goldman\u2019s $3.1 billion.During the first half, Morgan Stanley\u2019s overall trading revenue surpassed Goldman\u2019s for the first time since at least the financial crisis.Part of the story is that Goldman has stumbled. Its traders, once dominant on Wall Street, are struggling to find their footing amid sweeping market changes since the crisis. Trillions of dollars have shifted to passive funds, and then came a down spell for hedge funds as well as a long stretch of calm in the markets\u2014all of which have reduced demand for the complex products that are Goldman\u2019s signature.On Tuesday, Goldman reported trading revenue that fell 17% from a year earlier, the worst start to a year in CEO       Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s       11-year tenure. Fixed-income revenue fell 40%. Shares tumbled 2.6% on Tuesday and another 0.2% Wednesday.Goldman has acknowledged challenges in its trading business, with its Chief Financial Officer       R. Martin Chavez       \u200bsaying in a conference call\u200bthat \u200bthe firm \u201cdidn\u2019t navigate the market \u200bas well as we want to,\u201d over the past year or so. It has added new clients and businesses to be more resilient in different market conditions.Morgan Stanley, though, has tried to avoid trading mistakes while leaning heavily on its wealth-management business. That unit reported a record $4.2 billion in revenue and hit a 25% profit-margin target, the high end of a range set by Mr. Gorman.\u201cThere were plenty of skeptics\u201d on Morgan Stanley, said Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities. \u201cThey\u2019ve been proving naysayers wrong.\u201dWrite to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition as 'Bank Earnings Highlight Diverging Paths Since Crisis.'", "keywords": "2q earnings, bank earnings, bank profit, earnings season, fixed income, investment banking, james gorman,morgan stanley earnings, second-quarter earnings, trading, wealth management,Morgan Stanley,MS,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Bank of America,BAC,BACL,J.P.

China\u2019s commerce and foreign ministries didn\u2019t immediately comment on the outcome of the dialogue.The failure to take specific steps to close America\u2019s $347 billion trade deficit with China\u201470% of the U.S. global imbalance\u2014raises pressure on the Trump administration to consider shifting from its embrace of cooperation with Beijing toward more confrontation.Trump aides have been weighing a series of tougher trade policies toward China, from new import barriers on steel and solar panels, to tighter restrictions on investments, but have so far chosen not to implement them.People familiar with Wednesday\u2019s talks said that American negotiators tried, unsuccessfully, to use the threat of new steel tariffs to force the Chinese to commit to specific benchmarks for cutting the country\u2019s mammoth production overcapacity in that sector, a big factor dragging down steel prices globally.The meetings were held to mark the end of a 100-day period that President Donald Trump and Chinese President       Xi Jinping       had set to come up with a comprehensive plan to reset commercial ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The lack of any announced plan means they failed to meet that self-imposed deadline.The decision to issue a statement from just the U.S. side was a break with past practices after similar negotiations held in recent years during the Obama and Bush administrations. In the past, both countries issued common statements summarizing what they had discussed, emphasizing areas of agreement\u2014and usually issuing a list of sector-specific market-opening pledges from China. It was also a contrast with the more amicable joint statement given by Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi during an April Florida summit where they agreed to launch a \u201cComprehensive Economic Dialogue.\u201d\u201cMany expected at the 100-day point we would have much more substantive points of progress,\u201d said       Nicholas Lardy,        a China scholar at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He added that the lack of agreement on even modest measures is a sign that U.S.-China relations \u201care very uncertain and subject to very high risks.\u201dPeople familiar with the talks said a major sticking point was a demand from the American negotiators to craft a concrete plan, with benchmarks and a timetable, for reducing China\u2019s trade surplus with the U.S.\u201cThe administration wanted to put some numerical targets in place and I know China was uncomfortable with that,\u201d said       Myron Brilliant,        the U.S. Chamber of Commerce vice president of international affairs.More than his predecessors, Mr. Trump has focused not just on removing barriers to American exports, but on trying to curb America\u2019s trade deficit, which he has said is a concrete sign of flawed policies. Many economists say Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on trade deficits with individual countries is ill-conceived because deficits are driven in large part by macroeconomic factors beyond the control of trade negotiators, like national saving and investment patterns.Chinese Vice Premier       Wang Yang,        who headed his delegation, opened Wednesday\u2019s talks by saying that the economic teams from both countries \u201chave worked around the clock and have held over 60 rounds of working consultations\u201d since the Florida summit to prepare for this week\u2019s session. He portrayed those discussions as more \u201cintense\u201d than intricate negotiations surrounding China\u2019s joining the World Trade Organization in 2001.People familiar with the discussions said American negotiators had been optimistic going into the meetings that they could announce some kind of accords on Chinese regulation of data at multinational companies\u2014a major complaint of U.S. firms doing business there\u2014easing restrictions on foreign auto makers, curbing Chinese agricultural subsidies, and addressing Chinese steel overcapacity.The stall in economic talks mirrors a similarly rough patch in the Trump administration\u2019s diplomatic ties with Beijing. In the weeks since the Mar-a-Lago summit, Mr. Trump rebuffed Chinese objections in approving news arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province, and sent bombers and naval patrols this month to the South China Sea to assert American freedom to navigate those contested waters. Mr. Trump also tightened economic sanctions against companies and banks allegedly doing businesses aiding North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.The North Korea issue in particular may affect Mr. Trump\u2019s economic approach to China. The president said earlier that he would give China some leeway on trade in return for Beijing\u2019s help curbing Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. He has since said he was disappointed with China\u2019s efforts, which may make him feel freer to yield the trade club.\u201cIn terms of North Korea, our strength is trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week.Beijing hadn\u2019t been likely to grant major concessions to Washington even without recent irritants in the relationship, according to       Huo Jianguo,        a former Chinese trade official turned researcher.\u201cLarge gaps still exist between the U.S. and China in terms of their economic interests, and there\u2019s little consensus on an approach toward bridging those differences,\u201d said Mr. Huo, vice chairman of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies. \u201cBoth sides still need to time to adjust their mentalities.\u201dOn Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman       Lu Kang       told reporters that \u201csome differences and frictions are unavoidable\u201d between the U.S. and China, but added that \u201cthe two sides are fully capable of working them out properly though dialogue and consultation.\u201dThe Trump team early on expressed optimism that it had found a new formula for solving nettlesome trade tensions where prior administrations had failed. In May, as part of a quick down payment, the two governments announced agreement on Chinese market-opening measures in agriculture and finance, with a Chinese pledge to deliver concrete results before this week\u2019s meetings.But some U.S. business groups and affected companies have complained that while China has met the letter of its pledges, it has failed to live up to the spirit of them, removing the promised trade barriers, while leaving other impediments in place.A new tiff flared up this week when             Dow Chemical Co.       said China had appeared to renege on a promise to provide an expedited review of its genetically modified soybean crops as part of the May pledge to accelerate approval of eight stalled biotechnology products.The Chinese government said there had been a misunderstanding and that the Dow product hadn\u2019t been on its priority clearance list.Some American business leaders worry that the stalled talks could create new uncertainty and instability in bilateral economic ties.\u201cWe are disappointed the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue ended at an apparent impasse,\u201d       John Frisbie,        president of the US-China Business Council, said. \u201cIt is important for governments to take tangible steps to address long-standing issues and ensure the commercial relationship remains a source of stability in the overall relationship.\u201d\u2014Jacob Bunge in Chicago and Chun Han Wong in Beijing contributed to this article.Write to Jacob M.

That part of the order was a setback for President Donald Trump and signaled administration officials might have adopted too narrow a reading of the high court\u2019s ruling on the issue last month.But in a partial victory for the president, justices said his administration could move ahead for now to ban a broad group of refugees with no U.S. family ties.The White House didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department said it looked forward to making its arguments for the ban in additional court proceedings.The court\u2019s move marked the second time in recent weeks the justices have given Mr. Trump temporary leeway to impose travel restrictions on at least some people. In addition to suspending U.S. entry by refugees, the president has sought to bar travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.Mr. Trump has said the ban, which he signed in a March executive order, is needed to help protect the U.S. from terrorist threats.The justices on June 26 allowed the president to temporarily bar travel to the U.S. by people from the countries if they had no connection to the U.S., but it said travelers with close connections to people or organizations in the U.S. couldn\u2019t be barred while the court considers the case more fully.When the Trump administration began implementing the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance a few days later, the state of Hawaii, which had sued the president, argued that he was imposing the ban more strictly than the justices allowed.Trump officials said extended family members weren\u2019t close enough relatives to be exempt from the ban. The administration also said only a limited pool of refugees qualified for travel under the Supreme Court\u2019s terms. The administration argued Hawaii\u2019s interpretation of the high-court ruling would render the ban largely meaningless.The Supreme Court will give a full review of the travel ban on Oct. 10.Court rulings so far on Mr. Trump\u2019s travel restrictions haven\u2019t been final decisions on whether they are legal. Judges instead have been considering whether the ban could go into effect while the litigation continued on the underlying merits of the executive order.U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu, who has been presiding over travel ban litigation since March, ruled recently that the White House implementation plans contradicted last month\u2019s Supreme Court ruling. The judge said the administration must allow travel by a broader group of family members and refugees.The Justice Department filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, saying Judge Watson had gutted the ban and upended the balance the high court was seeking to strike.The court\u2019s order blocked Judge Watson\u2019s instruction that refugees aren\u2019t subject to the ban if they are covered by a formal admissions agreement between the U.S. government and a refugee resettlement agency. About 24,000 refugees covered by such agreements potentially stood to benefit from the Hawaii judge\u2019s ruling but now will not, at least in the short term.But the Supreme Court declined the Trump administration\u2019s request to clarify its ruling from last month and thus didn\u2019t allow the president to enforce plans to bar travel by extended family members.The court in its brief order didn\u2019t explain its reasoning.Like its ruling last month, the court again appeared to find some ideological common ground for its action.No justice registered a dissent to the court\u2019s action on refugees.However, three conservative justices\u2014      Clarence Thomas,       Samuel Alito       and       Neil Gorsuch      \u2014said they would have allowed the president to bar travel by extended family members. Those same justices registered similar objections last month, saying they would have sided more broadly with the president.The American Civil Liberties Union, which has been challenging the Trump ban in court, expressed ambivalence about the latest outcome.\u201cWe are glad that the order requiring the government to recognize grandparents and other close family remains in place, but are deeply concerned about the effect of today\u2019s ruling on thousands of refugees who seek to escape dangerous situations, who have been fully vetted by the United States, and whose arrival communities, congregations, and organizations in the United States have been preparing for and anticipating,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, an attorney at the ACLU.The Supreme Court is on summer break with several justices traveling. Chief Justice       John Roberts,        for example, is on an itinerary that takes him through Australia and New Zealand.The court, however, still can consider emergency appeals even when it isn\u2019t in session.On the broader issues in the case, one appeals court said the president likely disfavored Muslims in a way that violated the Constitution. Another said Mr. Trump didn\u2019t adequately justify that the ban was needed. The Justice Department argues that both courts were wrong, saying the president has broad powers over U.S. borders, especially when national security is a consideration.The Supreme Court will review those rulings when it returns in October.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition as 'Top Court Revises Travel Ban Scope.'", "keywords": "refugees,supreme court,travel ban,trump travel ban,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,government bodies,executive branch,judicial branch"}]
