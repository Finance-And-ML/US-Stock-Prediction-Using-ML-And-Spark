Martinelli was taken into custody without incident as he emerged from a home outside Miami on Monday evening, according to Manny Puri, assistant chief of the agency's district office in Miami. Puri said deputy marshals had placed the residence under surveillance and acted on a provisional arrest warrant issued by the U.S. Justice Department in response to a Panamanian request last September seeking Martinelli's extradition. Martinelli was transported to a federal detention center in Miami and was due to appear in U.S. District Court on Tuesday to face an extradition hearing, Puri said. The arrest warrant would remain under seal until then, he said. Interpol also issued a notice for Martinelli's arrest last month. The former Panamanian leader is accused of using public money to spy illegally on more than 150 political rivals during his 2009-2014 term as president.

The defense team of ex-president Martinelli will exercise the guarantees afforded by the rule of law,  Martinelli's spokesman, Luis Eduardo Camacho, said in a statement. Martinelli, a supermarket tycoon, presided over an infrastructure boom and Latin America's fastest economic growth in recent years, but his administration was tainted by allegations of corruption. Slideshow (4 Images)In response to Panama's extradition request last year, he lashed out at the current government and described himself as a victim of a politically motivated witch-hunt. Martinelli has denied any wrongdoing and said on Twitter last month that his successor, Juan Carlos Varela, was going after him to divert attention from his own problems. Varela served as Martinelli's vice president but they have sparred bitterly since the transfer of power.  Panama's Supreme Court issued a warrant for Martinelli's arrest in December 2015 after he failed to appear at a Panamanian court hearing on his case.

Taillon returned to the mound and threw five scoreless innings during the Pirates' 7-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Monday at PNC Park. Taillon (3-1) hadn't pitched for Pittsburgh since May 4, and he underwent surgery on May 8, but after three rehab starts, he was ready to get back to major league competition. The 25-year-old Florida native struck out the first two batters he faced and wound up fanning five, walking two and allowing five hits on 82 pitches.  That's a tough lineup,  he said.  A lot of tough takes. It's a team I had to roll up my sleeves against them.  Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at PiratesColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchTaillon didn't necessarily have his best stuff, but that was to be expected considering the circumstance.  He pitched well,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  His command wasn't anything close to what we've seen in the past. He went out there and he pitched. It was fun to watch.  While Taillon has said he wants to be able to use his platform to raise awareness about his disease, he also is thankful to be able to get back to focusing on baseball.  I feel like I've been through a lot,  he said.  Hopefully, there's not that much more coming my way and I can just take the ball every fifth day. But whenever there's a runner on third and no outs, it's not as big of a deal to me anymore. That was a bit of perspective.  The Pirates' offense provided Taillon with plenty of support. They got things started in the first inning as Josh Harrison hit his eighth home run of the season. Max Moroff walked to get the inning started before Harrison put a 1-1 pitch from Kyle Freeland into the seats for a quick 2-0 lead. Pittsburgh added two more in the fourth. Harrison reached on a throwing error by Colorado shortstop Trevor Story and scored on David Freese's double. Two batters later, Andrew McCutchen drove in Freese with a single. Harrison went 2-for-4 and extended his hitting streak to 10 games. In that streak, he is hitting .395 with four RBIs. Freese and Jose Osuna added two hits apiece. Gregory Polanco singled home Moroff in the sixth to chase Freeland (7-4), who gave up five runs (four earned) and allowed a season-high nine hits in 5 2/3 innings. He walked two and struck out three.  He got us into the sixth inning and gave a chance to win at 4-1,  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  Kyle hung in there. He wasn't as sharp as we've seen him. A couple of hitters did a nice job of staying on his sinker and going the other way with it.  The story of the game was that their guys made big pitches, we didn't, and they kept adding on runs.  John Jaso drew a bases-loaded walk and Moroff hit a sacrifice fly to score two more runs in the seventh. Colorado's Ian Desmond doubled and scored on Story's single off Pirates reliever Wade LeBlanc in the sixth. Pat Valaika doubled and scored on a DJ LeMahieu groundout in the ninth. NOTES: To clear a spot for RHP Jameson Taillon's move from the disabled list to the 25-man roster, the Pirates optioned INF Phil Gosselin to Triple-A Indianapolis. Since being recalled on June 2, Gosselin appeared in five games and went 1-for-8 with one RBI. He is hitting .135 on the season. ... The Pirates drafted RHP Shane Baz from Concordia Lutheran High School in Tomball, Texas, with the No. 12 pick in the first round of the draft. ... The Rockies selected Stillwater, Okla., 3B Ryan Vilade with the 48th pick in the second round of the draft. Colorado did not have a first-round pick due to the signing of free agent OF/INF Ian Desmond. ... Rockies SS Trevor Story singled in the sixth inning to snap an 0-for-13 skid. Story is hitting .194 on the season. ... Colorado CF Charlie Blackmon went 1-for-3 to extend his hitting streak to 10 games. Blackmon is hitting .337 on the season and is 17-for-39 (.436) in his current streak.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rockies-pirates-writethru-idUSMTZED6DGT2JPT"},

Moon's comments were an apparent reference to the issue of  Korean  comfort women , a Japanese euphemism for women forced to work in the Japanese military's wartime brothels. Any flare-up in the long-running dispute over 'comfort women' could complicate efforts by Seoul, Tokyo and their ally Washington to cope with North Korea, which has been ramping up weapons tests since last year in defiance of global sanctions. Moon told the visiting secretary general of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party that the people of South Korea did not accept a deal reached by his conservative predecessor and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2015 to resolve the issue. But Moon, in his talks with Toshihiro Nikai, apparently did not directly address whether he would try to renegotiate the agreement. Under the deal, Japan apologized again to the now-elderly women and promised about one billion yen ($9.07 million) for a fund to help them. The two governments agreed the issue would be  irreversibly resolved  if both fulfilled their obligations.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in (R) talks with Toshihiro Nikai, Secretary General of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, during their meeting at the Presidential Blue House in Seoul, South Korea June 12, 2017.Kim Hong-Ji Both South Korea and Japan should look at this issue directly and understanding is needed that it will take more time (to resolve it),  Moon told Nikai, the South's presidential office said. Moon, who suggested during his successful campaign for a May 9 election that he could try to renegotiate the deal, also said the two countries should not  cling to past history  only to block other developments in their ties. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga on Tuesday reiterated that both countries should stick to the agreement.  This agreement, which is highly evaluated by international society, is being steadily implemented. That is extremely important. We have conveyed this fact to the new South Korean administration through various routes,â Suga told reporters. Japan wants South Korea to remove a statue near the Japanese consulate in Busan city commemorating Korean comfort women as well as another near the Japanese embassy in Seoul, saying that the presence of the statues violate the 2015 agreement. Moon on Monday stressed the importance of cooperation with Japan in efforts to denuclearize North Korea and Nikai agreed, the South's presidential office said, while Suga said the two confirmed the importance of putting pressure on North Korea.

By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - U.S. senators reached an agreement on Monday on legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia, including a provision that would prevent the White House from easing, suspending or ending sanctions without congressional approval. The agreement, to be filed as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill, is intended to punish Russia over issues including its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for the government of Syria in that country's six-year-long civil war. The Iran bill is due come up for a vote as soon as this week. Besides the provision setting up a process for Congress to review changes in sanctions, the measure would put into law sanctions previously established via presidential executive order, including some on certain Russian energy projects and debt financing in some industries. It would impose new sanctions on Russians found to be guilty of human rights abuses, supplying weapons to Syria's government and conduct cyber attacks on behalf of Russia's government, among others. The measure also would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. The legislation is backed by both Republicans and Democrats, and is expected to easily pass the Senate. It was introduced amid an intense focus in the U.S. capital on relations with Russia, and investigations by the Department of Justice and congressional committees of whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. elections to help elect Republican President Donald Trump, and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow as it sought to influence the election. To become law, the legislation would have to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump. If Trump objected, some of its backers said they expected enough congressional support to override a veto.  These additional sanctions will ... send a powerful and bipartisan statement to Russia and any other country who might try to interfere in our elections that they will be punished,  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Russia has denied attempting to interfere in the U.S election, and Trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. The measure also authorizes  robust assistance  to strengthen democratic institutions and counter disinformation in European countries that might be targeted by what the legislation's sponsors described as Russian aggression. In December, the final full month of President Barack Obama's administration, Washington sanctioned Russian businessmen and companies for Moscow's role in Ukraine via executive order.

The situation in Afghanistan, which U.S. military officials acknowledge is in a stalemate almost 16 years since the war started, has deteriorated in recent months. A truck-bomb explosion in Kabul last month killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. In some cases, Afghan security forces have been forced to abandon more scattered and rural bases, and the government can claim to control or influence only 57 percent of the country, according to U.S. military estimates earlier this year.  We are taking a regional approach to this,  Mattis told the House Armed Services Committee.   We will take that forward to the president for a decision very soon.  Mattis said a request by General John Nicholson, the head of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, for additional troops would mostly be made up of troops who would train, advise and assist Afghan forces, potentially putting them with Afghan forces at the brigade level.   It's a fundamental change to how we bring our, what I would call our real superiority, in terms of air support,  Mattis said.  At the same hearing, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford said he had gone to Mattis and Trump with  some options that might be considered  in order to help improve the security situation in Afghanistan. Reuters reported in late April that Trump's administration was carrying out a review of Afghanistan and conversations were revolving around sending between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops there. Deliberations include giving more authorities to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters.  Some U.S. officials questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and over 17,000 wounded.  On Saturday, three U.S. soldiers were killed when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan.

The New York Mets manager saw an even rarer old-school relic in the ninth inning: His starting pitcher was still on the mound. Right-hander Jacob deGrom, reeling from the worst two-start stretch of his career, induced four double-play grounders in throwing his second career complete game Monday night, when he twirled a five-hitter to lead the Mets past the Chicago Cubs 6-1 at Citi Field.  I don't know how many double plays we turned -- four or five -- but those guys made great plays behind me tonight,  deGrom said. DeGrom (5-3) got the Cubs to hit into a 4-6-3 double play -- Neil Walker to Asdrubal Cabrera to Lucas Duda -- in four straight innings between the third and the sixth. The final three all came after deGrom allowed the leadoff batter to reach base.  It was pretty funny to have those double plays tonight,  Collins said.  We were talking in the dugout yesterday -- you just don't see ground balls anymore, with the new launch angle stuff that's going around through baseball, nobody hits ground balls.  Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at MetsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatchNor does anyone throw complete games anymore. DeGrom's was the first by a Mets pitcher since the right-hander tossed a one-hit shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies last July 16. His complete games are the only ones by New York since the start of the 2016 season. Despite traveling into unfamiliar territory, deGrom took command of the dugout conversation with Collins in between the top and bottom of the eighth, when the Mets added two runs to remove any chance for a save situation.  I walked in and said I wanted to finish the game,  deGrom said.  So that's when I knew I was going back out.  The reporters gathered around deGrom chuckled, but his stoic expression never wavered.  You don't get many chances, I feel like, to finish games,  deGrom said to a follow-up question.  And that was the chance. So I wanted to stay out there.  DeGrom ended up making the last out of the bottom of the eighth before making quick work of the Cubs in the ninth, when he needed just 10 pitches to throw a perfect inning and cap a game that lasted just two hours and 23 minutes -- the shortest of the season for the Mets. The last of deGrom's 116 pitches -- the fifth-most of his career -- was a 97 mph fastball. He walked four, struck out six and retired the final seven batters following Addison Russell's two-out homer in the seventh. The gem came after deGrom allowed 15 runs over eight innings in his previous two starts.  I got my teeth kicked in,  deGrom said.  Definitely wanted to have a good one, and fortunate enough tonight that I did.  Cabrera atoned for his recent fielding struggles -- three errors in the last three games, including a drop of a pop-up off the bat of Jason Heyward in the second inning Monday -- by hitting a pair of solo homers. Jay Bruce went 3-for-4 with a two-run homer while Travis d'Arnaud (RBI double) and Jose Reyes (RBI single) added run-scoring hits in the ninth. Five players had a hit apiece for the Cubs (31-32), who were limited to three runs or fewer for the fourth time in the last five games, a stretch in which the defending World Series champions are 1-4.  We can't keep using that as an excuse, that the other team's pitcher is good,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  We've got to start beating some better pitchers, period. You don't get to the promised land without winning games like that -- maybe 3-2, 4-3, whatever.  Right-hander John Lackey (4-7) took the loss after giving up four runs on six hits and two walks while striking out one over five innings.  Definitely didn't feel great today,  Lackey said.  Need to pitch better. The other guy pitched really good.  NOTES: Mets OF Michael Conforto (back) did not play. Manager Terry Collins said Conforto developed a stiff back during Saturday's doubleheader against the Atlanta Braves and that he wasn't available to pinch-hit on Monday. Conforto is day-to-day. ... Mets LF Yoenis Cespedes left after the fifth inning due to a sore left heel. Cespedes just returned from the disabled list Saturday after missing 37 games due to left hamstring and right quad injuries. Both Cespedes and Collins expressed confidence he would return to the lineup Tuesday. .... Cubs RHP Kyle Hendricks (right hand) is scheduled to throw a side session Tuesday and could return to the rotation this weekend. ... The Cubs finished one double play shy of the team record for a game, last set on June 4, 1981.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-mets-writethru-idUSMTZED6DGRD0NF"},

The stellar performance for the Chinese contract drug research and development company comes after its IPO, Hong Kong's largest new listing so far in 2017, raised $511 million, pricing at the top of its marketed range. The stock rose to as high as HK$28.70, compared to its HK$20.60 IPO price on its first day of trade. The benchmark Hang Seng index firmed 0.3 percent. Demand from retail investors - who can have a significant impact on first-day trading in Hong Kong share offerings - accounted for 37.5 times the number of shares on offer in the deal, WuXi Biologics said in a filing on Monday. The institutional tranche was  very significantly  oversubscribed, it added. Typically, companies going public set aside 10 percent of the shares on offer for retail investors, with the remainder going to institutional buyers, but that volume goes up depending on the level of oversubscription. In the case of WuXi Biologics, underwriters ended up allocating 30 percent of the IPO to mom and pop investors, meaning fewer shares were available for professional buyers. The supply of shares to institutional investors was further reduced as WuXi Biologics sold 7 percent of the shares on offer to four so-called crossover investors, or existing shareholders that wanted to add to their holdings - Fubon Life Insurance Co Ltd, which is a unit of Taiwan's Fubon Financial Holding Co Ltd , Taikang Insurance Group Inc (IPO-TKLI.HK) and venture capital firms Hillhouse Capital Management Ltd and Qiming Investments Ltd.  This IPO has been in high demand,  said a person with direct knowledge of the WuXi Biologics deal, who was not authorized to discuss the IPO publicly.  For the Hong Kong market, there is very limited supply of these kind of high-tech bio companies getting listed. As a result, fund managers are keen to subscribe to this IPO, with high potential on profit growth and good concept.  WuXi Biologics' revenue jumped 77 percent in 2016, while profits more than tripled last year as it expanded the business and launched new projects, according to the IPO prospectus. The company plans to use about 45 percent of its proceeds from the IPO to pay all its outstanding loans and debt and another 45 percent to expand its facilities in Shanghai and in nearby Wuxi in Eastern China. The remaining 10 percent will be used for working capital.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index was 0.7 percent, or 41.1 points, higher at 5,718.70 by 0248 GMT. The benchmark ended flat on Friday and lost nearly 2 percent last week. Financial markets in Australia were closed on Monday for a public holiday. REA Group, Computershare Ltd, and Carsales.com, which form a substantial chunk of the Aussie tech sector, fell in a range of 0.8 percent and 1 percent, tracking a rout in U.S. technology shares.  Over the weekend, we saw infotech stocks coming for some profit-taking and it looks as though investors are looking elsewhere for value,  said Ric Spooner, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.  The attention seems to be turning to some of the big up sectors in the Australian market, particularly the financial and oil stocks.  Financial stocks were the biggest gainers on the main index with profits concentrated in the 'Big Four' banks, which rose in the range of 1.5 to 1.8 percent. Macquarie Group, Australia's fifth-biggest bank by market value, was about 1.5 percent higher. The utilities and energy sectors were pushed up by higher oil prices, lifted by news that OPEC-leader Saudi Arabia was making significant supply cuts to customers. Utility stocks Origin Energy and APA Group , both with significant natural gas interests, rose 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. Australian oil and gas majors Woodside Petroleum and Oil Search added 0.9 percent and 0.6 percent. On the other hand, mining stocks remained soft after two straight weeks of losses as the outlook for iron ore remained bleak as worries prevailed about a growing glut of iron ore in China, the world's top buyer of the commodity. Base metals prices dipped too as investors awaited a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting and economic data from China to gauge future demand growth. Mining giant Rio Tinto was off 0.2 percent, while rival BHP was about 0.1 percent down. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index seesawed as gains in financials and consumer cyclical stocks grappled with losses in the tech and consumer staples sectors. Building materials maker Fletcher Building and Skycity Entertainment Group were the biggest gainers on the main index by weight, up 2.1 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively. Auckland International Airport was the biggest drag on the benchmark, and software services firm Xero Ltd was the biggest percentage loser, down nearly 2 percent.

The 21-year-old from Bangkok is the 10th player to be crowned number one since the rankings were created in 2006 and joins an illustrious group that includes Annika Sorenstam, Lorena Ochoa, Yani Tseng and Park In-bee. Ariya, the second-youngest player to take top spot after South Korea-born Ko, had erroneously been told last week that her performance at the ShopRite Classic was enough to lift her into top spot. However, New Zealander Ko was later reinstated as number one after it emerged projections from the Women's World Golf Rankings (WWGR) were faulty. Ariya said she was proud of her achievement and promised to work hard to maintain top spot.  It means the world to me,  she told the LPGA website.  We get to show the world that Thai people can do it. It's been a long road getting to this spot, but it will be even more challenging from this point on.  While Ko has struggled for form after changing her coach, caddie and equipment, there are no shortage of challengers to Ariya's throne with the likes of South Korean Ryu So-yeon and American Lexi Thompson hard on her heels.   The ranking can change after any week, and I will just keep working very hard every single day,  said the Thai.  I donât see this as a mission complete, but itâs just the beginning.  The LPGA Tour moves to Michigan this week for the Meijer Classic, with the KPMG Women's PGA Championship, the second major on the 2017 schedule, looming at the end of the month.

The Washington-based C4ADS think tank said a small number of interconnected Chinese firms accounted for the vast proportion of trade with North Korea, leaving the impoverished country's procurement network vulnerable to targeted, enforced sanctions. The report said it was a mistake to think that sanctions could not succeed against a country like North Korea, which was less isolated than it appeared.  A concerted effort by the international community to target specific sanctions-violating entities is needed,  it said. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has become increasingly alarmed about North Korea, which says it is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States.  Washington has been pressing China, North Korea's neighbor, ally and main trading partner, to further curb trade with the country, but has so far stopped short of an all-out campaign of  secondary sanctions  against Chinese entities violating U.N. sanctions by dealing with Pyongyang.    The C4ADS report said a relatively small number of Chinese companies - 5,233 - traded with North Korea from 2013-2016, compared with the 67,163 that exported to South Korea. A disproportionate amount of the total trade with North Korea was conducted by an even smaller number of trading firms, with 10 Chinese importers of North Korean goods in 2016 accounting for 30 percent of the market. It said the top 10 Chinese exporters to North Korea had held that status for at least three or four years since 2013.  By isolating firms that have sent potential dual-use weapons technology to the regime, it may be possible to identify sanctions violations and the North Korean overseas networks that surround them,  the report said. It pointed to one Chinese firm, Dandong Dongyuan Industrial Co. Ltd., which according to Chinese trade figures sent $28.5 million worth of material to North Korea from 2013-2016, including a shipment of $790,000 of  radio navigational aid apparatus  in June 2016. It quoted experts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in the United States as saying the category of goods could cover guidance devices for ballistic missiles. The report also said that, according to the Hong Kong business registry, the firm's owner, Chinese national Sun Sidong, owned a firm that used to own a ship seized last year by Egyptian authorities carrying 30,000 North Korean-made rocket propelled grenades hidden under a cargo of iron ore. C4ADS said that when the vessel, the Jie Shun, was seized, its registered owner was a firm owned by Sun Sihong, who listed her residential address as an apartment in the same complex as Sun Sidong. Asked about the report, the U.S. Treasury declined to discuss future sanctions plans but said Washington would  continue to target individuals and entities responsible for financing and supporting North Koreaâs nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.   Treasury is working with our allies to counter networks that enable North Koreaâs destabilizing activities, and we urge our international partners to take parallel steps to cut off their funding sources,  the spokesman said.

Masayoshi Amamiya, the BOJ's executive director overseeing monetary policy, told Parliament on Tuesday the pace of bond buying had slowed because U.S. Treasury yields have fallen - enabling the central bank to cap Japanese long-term rates while also reducing its purchases.  The slowdown came as a result of our policy of guiding yields at appropriate levels,  he told parliament, when asked by a ruling party lawmaker why the BOJ's purchases were slowing.  The BOJ will continue to take necessary steps to stabilise prices, while keeping an eye on how they affect its financial health,  he said. After three years of heavy asset buying failed to drive up inflation, the BOJ switched its policy framework last year to one that capped long-term interest rates from a policy that had  targeted the pace of money printing. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly said the central bank still had plenty of bonds to buy, and that it was premature to openly debate an exit strategy from the stimulus programme. But buying large amounts of Japanese government bonds is expected to become increasingly difficult as the central bank already owns more than 42 percent of the entire JGB market. Indeed, recent data showed the BOJ's bond buying has slowed considerably in recent months. Most analysts expect the BOJ to slow the pace further to around 60 trillion yen ($546 billion) by the end of year and to omit from its policy statement a loose pledge to increase its JGB holding by 80 trillion yen a year at some point. The fate of the pledge may be among topics the BOJ's nine board members will discuss at their two-day policy meeting that starts on Thursday. With the BOJ now targeting interest rates, many central bank policymakers see the 80-trillion-yen pledge as obsolete and largely symbolic. But some remain wary of removing the pledge now fearing it could be misinterpreted as a sign the BOJ is contemplating withdrawing its stimulus programme at short notice.

The regimeâs nuclear weapons program is a clear and present danger to all, and the regimeâs provocative actions, manifestly illegal under international law, have not abated despite United Nationsâ censure and sanctions,  Mattis said in a written statement to the House Armed Services Committee.  The most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security is North Korea,  the statement added.  North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them has increased in pace and scope.  Related CoverageU.S.'s Shannon: North Korea could become global threatEarlier this month, the U.N. Security Council expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea after its repeated missile tests, adopting the first such resolution agreed by the United States and China since President Donald Trump took office.  The U.S. focus on North Korea has been sharpened by dozens of North Korean missile launches and two nuclear bomb tests since the beginning of last year and by Pyongyang's vow to develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. Mattis, speaking before the panel, warned of the potential losses in the case of conflict with North Korea.   It would be a war like nothing we have seen since 1953 and we would have to deal with it with whatever level of force was necessary ... It would be a very, very serious war,  Mattis said. The Korean War ended in 1953, three years after fighting began in a conflict that would kill 140,000 South Koreans, 36,000 U.S. soldiers and 1 million civilians.  South Korea's top national security adviser said last week that Seoul did not aim to change its agreement on the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system to protect against North Korea, despite a decision to delay its full installation. Chung Eui-yong called the decision to delay installation of remaining launchers of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, system, pending a review of its environmental impact, a domestic measure to ensure a democratic process.

(Reuters) - Jurors began deliberating at Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial on Monday after a weeklong proceeding in Pennsylvania that saw prosecutors and defense lawyers paint starkly different portraits of the once-beloved comedian. The jury discussed the case for about four hours before adjourning at 9:30 p.m. (0130 GMT), after both sides delivered their closing arguments earlier in the day. Montgomery District Attorney Kevin Steele told jurors Cosby's own words, given to police and in a deposition more than a decade ago, show he ensnared Andrea Constand by posing as a trusted mentor before drugging and sexually assaulting her in his home in 2004.  Ladies and gentlemen, he has told you what he has done,  he said.  It is about as straightforward as you are ever going to see in a sex crimes case.  But defense lawyer Brian McMonagle said Constand's inconsistent accounts, including her shifting estimate of when the incident occurred, revealed her to be a liar out for financial gain.  She'd remember it for the next 365 days and all the days of her life if there were a sexual assault in this case,  he said in his own summation, as Cosby's wife, Camille, sat in the courtroom for the first time since trial began. Related CoverageProsecutor says Cosby's words show guilt of sexual assaultCosby lawyer employs tough cross-examinations, dramatic styleCosby, star of the 1980s hit family sitcom  The Cosby Show  and once a popular figure in television commercials, faces charges that he assaulted Constand, now 44, at his home in 2004. At the time, she was director of operations for the women's basketball team at Cosby's alma mater, Temple University. Dozens of women have made similar accusations against Cosby, 79, although only Constand has accused him of a crime that allegedly took place recently enough to allow for prosecution.  Cosby, who did not testify, has denied all allegations. Steele's closing argument focused on Cosby's statements in an interview with police and sworn depositions he gave as part of Constand's civil lawsuit more than a decade ago. Actor and comedian Bill Cosby (L) leaves with his spokesman Andrew Wyatt after a break in the deliberations in his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S. June 12, 2017.Brendan McDermidCosby acknowledged that he obtained Quaaludes, a prescription sedative, in the 1970s to give to young women.     Steele argued that admission showed Cosby was knowingly trying to incapacitate Constand when he gave her 1-1/2 pills, which Cosby said were Benadryl. Constand testified the pills left her disoriented and unable to resist him. In his argument, McMonagle emphasized that Cosby consistently portrayed the encounter as consensual. Slideshow (19 Images)The defense lawyer also walked the jury through several discrepancies in Constand's story. He noted she first told police that she cut off contact with Cosby after the incident but actually called him more than 50 times over two months.  That's a lie,  McMonagle told jurors.  It's not a fib, it's not a mistake. It's a stone-cold lie.  Constand testified last week that she made the calls because of her job at Temple, where Cosby was a trustee and a famous alumnus, and Steele noted the calls stopped as soon as she left the school. McMonagle also questioned why Constand would continue spending time privately with Cosby even after he made sexual advances that she said she rebuffed. Steele reminded jurors that a psychologist had testified that victims of sexual trauma often have trouble recalling every detail. He said Constand was always clear on the key facts: Cosby gave her unidentified pills he suggested were herbal, and then sexually abused her. Prosecutors also called a second accuser, Kelly Johnson, who told jurors that Cosby sexually assaulted her in a similar manner in 1996.

The Nikkei was a fraction lower, down 0.05 percent at 19,899.14, after dipping to 19,850.86 soon after the open. The index had fallen 0.5 percent on Monday after U.S. tech heavyweights such as Apple Inc suffered heavy losses. The Nasdaq extended losses from Friday's plunge and slipped on Monday as tech, still the best performing S&P; 500 sector this year, continued to succumb under its own weight. The Nikkei slipped early on Tuesday in a knee-jerk reaction, but eventually cancelled out those losses.  Domestic equities have stood on a relatively firm footing, thanks to strength of some individual shares, and this is helping the broader market absorb negative external pressures,  said Hitoshi Ishiyama, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.  The view that some U.S. tech shares are going through inevitable adjustments while retaining a positive outlook is also lessening the impact on the domestic market.  Overall, movements were limited ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting that ends on Wednesday, at which the central bank is expected to raise interest rates. Investors will focus on any fresh hints on the pace of further tightening and any details of the central bank's plans to trim its balance sheet. Utilities, drug makers and other defensive stocks performed relatively well. Tokyo Electric Power Holdings (TEPCO) edged up 0.4 percent. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co rose 0.3 percent and brewer Kirin Holdings Co climbed 0.7 percent. Renesas Electronics Corp dropped as much as 8.8 percent to 946 yen after the semiconductor manufacturer set the share price of its secondary offer at 825 yen, a discount of about 20 percent from Monday's closing price of 1,037 yen. Toshiba Corp extended gains from the previous day and rose as much as 4.5 percent to 344 yen, the highest since December 2016. Apple and computing giant Dell Inc will join a Foxconn-led consortium bidding for Toshiba's highly-prized chip unit, the CEO of the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer told Reuters on Monday. The broader Topix was up 0.2 percent at 1,595.10 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.2 percent to 14,201.85.

ESET, a Slovakian anti-virus software maker, and Dragos Inc, a U.S. critical-infrastructure security firm, released detailed analyses of the malware, known as Industroyer or Crash Override, and issued private alerts to governments and infrastructure operators to help them defend against the threat. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was investigating the malware, though it had seen no evidence to suggest it has infected U.S. critical infrastructure.  The two firms said they did not know who was behind the cyber attack. Ukraine has blamed Russia, though officials in Moscow have repeatedly denied blame. Still, the firms warned that there could be more attacks using the same approach, either by the group that built the malware or copycats who modify the malicious software.   The malware is really easy to re-purpose and use against other targets. That is definitely alarming,  said ESET malware researcher Robert Lipovsky said in a telephone interview.  This could cause wide-scale damage to infrastructure systems that are vital.  The Department of Homeland Security corroborated that warning, saying it was working to better understand the threat posed by Crash Override.   The tactics, techniques and procedures described as part of the Crash Override malware could be modified to target U.S. critical information networks and systems,  the agency said in an alert posted on its website. The alert posted some three dozen technical indicators that a system had been compromised by Crash Override and asked firms to contact the agency if they suspected their systems were compromised by the malware. Dragos founder Robert M. Lee said the malware was capable of attacking power systems across Europe and could be leveraged against the United States  with small modifications.   It is able to cause outages of up to a few days in portions of a nation's grid, but is not potent enough to bring down a country's entire grid, Lee said by phone. With modifications, the malware could attack other types of infrastructure including local transportation providers, water and gas providers, Lipovsky said.   Power firms are concerned there will be more attacks, Alan Brill, a leader of Kroll's cyber security practice, said in a telephone interview.  You are dealing with very smart people who came up with something and deployed it,  Brill said.  It represents a risk to power distribution organizations everywhere.  Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene. The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program. A spokesman for Ukraine's state cyber police said it was not clear whether the malware was used in the December 2016 attack. Ukraine's state-run Computer Emergency Response Team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The Kremlin and Russia's Federal Security Service did not reply to requests for comment. Crash Override can be detected if a utility monitors its network for abnormal traffic, including signs the malware is searching for the location of substations or sending messages to switch breakers, according to Lee, a former U.S. Air Force cyber warfare operations officer.  Malware has been used in other disruptive attacks on industrial targets, including the 2015 Ukraine power outage, but in those cases human intervention was required.  ESET said it had been analyzing the malware for several months and had held off on going public to preserve the integrity of investigations into the power system hack.

Alfred Adkins, 45, was found guilty by a federal jury in Lexington, Kentucky, on four counts including conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud following a one-week trial, the U.S. Justice Department said. His conviction came after Adkins was charged in April 2016 along with a retired U.S. Social Security Administration administrative law judge and a lawyer who advertised his services through the website MrSocialSecurity.com.  Today's jury verdict holds accountable the final defendant for his role in the largest scheme to defraud the Social Security Administration in its history,  Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Blanco said in a statement. Adkins, a resident of Shelbiana, Kentucky, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 22. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors said that during the course of the scheme from 2004 to 2012, Conn paid more than $600,000 to Daugherty to award benefits to clients for whom Conn submitted falsified medical documents. Conn also paid medical professionals including Adkins to sign fabricated medical forms before evaluations of his clients took place, prosecutors said. During the scheme, Adkins earned about $200,000, they said. Adkins also performed perfunctory evaluations of Conn's clients and altered his findings at the lawyer's request on certain reports before signing forms claiming the clients were qualified for benefits, prosecutors said. Based on the fraudulent medical documentation Conn and Adkins submitted, Daugherty issued decisions granting disability benefits in favor of Conn's clients. In total, the scheme caused the Social Security Administration to pay over $600 million in disability benefits in more than 2,000 cases, and Conn received more than $7.5 million of taxpayer dollars in attorney's fees, prosecutors said. Conn, 56, pleaded guilty in March to one count of theft of government money and one count of payment of gratuities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation earlier this month announced that Conn on June 2 removed an ankle monitor and fled. The agency is now offering a $20,000 reward for information that would lead to his arrest. Daugherty, 81, pleaded guilty in May to two counts of receiving illegal gratuities.

The detention of the first Singaporean woman for suspected Islamist radicalism comes as concern is growing about the spread of Islamic State in the region. Singapore and its neighbors recently began intelligence cooperation aimed at stemming the movement of militants across their borders. Singapore has reiterated over the past year that it is a target of Islamist groups and has urged the public to be alert. The suspect, Syaikhah Izzah Zahrah Al Ansari, 22, was detained this month for intending to make her way to Syria to join Islamic State of Iraq and Syria with her child, the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement.   She supported ISIS's use of violence to establish and defend its self-declared 'caliphate', and aspired to live in it,  the ministry said, referring to Islamic State. Izzah, a contract assistant at an infant care center, was radicalized as early as 2013 by online propaganda with links to Islamic State and she shared pro-Islamic State material on social media. She had also sought a militant husband in Syria, the ministry said, adding that her family had tried to talk her out of her plans but had not handed her in, and had even destroyed evidence against her.  She said that since 2015, she was looking for 'a Salafi or an ISIS supporter' to marry and settle down with him and her child in Syria,  the ministry said.   She said she would support her husband if he fought for ISIS in Syria as she believed she would reap âheavenly rewardsâ if he died in battle. With her âelevated statusâ as a âmartyrâs widowâ, she felt she could easily marry another ISIS fighter in Syria.  Her parents, both Quranic teachers, and sister came to know of her radical postings in 2015. After she was placed under investigation, important evidence was destroyed by a family member relating to her plans to join Islamic State, in order to try to cover up her acts, it said.  They tried on their own to dissuade her but they were unsuccessful. Izzah continued down the path of radicalism. In April 2017, she boasted to a contact that the Singapore authorities had not detected her,  the ministry said. FILE PHOTO: People walk past the skyline of Marina Bay central business district in Singapore April 26, 2013.Edgar Su/File PhotoThe ministry said the authorities were looking into taking action against the family member who destroyed evidence.  The government takes a serious view of the withholding of information that is pertinent to the safety and security of Singapore and Singaporeans,  it said in a statement to Reuters. Arrests on the Rise The ministry declined to say how authorities came to know of her radicalism.  It said she created new social media accounts even after several of her accounts on which she shared pro-Islamic State material were taken down by administrators. Izzah has been detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA), a colonial-era law that allows authorities to detain anyone seen as a threat to security for up to two years.  As concern grows about the spread of militancy, there has been a significant rise in the number of detentions under the law. At least 14 radicalized Singaporeans have been put under restriction or detention orders under the ISA since 2015, up sharply from 11 cases between 2007 and 2014, according to data from the ministry. Volunteers from a group specializing in  religious rehabilitation  offer counseling to detainees, the group says. Singapore recently launched a campaign to urge citizens to report anyone deemed at risk of being radicalized. Diverse, affluent Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese with  sizeable minority ethnic Malay and ethnic Indian communities, and numerous foreign workers from Asia and beyond. Singapore said late last year it had deported nearly 70 foreigners including five maids for suspected radicalism over the previous two years. Authorities in neighboring Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population, said last year they had arrested six Indonesian suspects with links to Islamic State who were plotting an attack on Singapore.

The regimeâs nuclear weapons program is a clear and present danger to all, and the regimeâs provocative actions, manifestly illegal under international law, have not abated despite United Nationsâ censure and sanctions,  Mattis said in a written statement to the House Armed Services Committee.  The most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security is North Korea,  the statement added.  North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them has increased in pace and scope.  Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea after its repeated missile tests, adopting the first such resolution agreed by the United States and China since President Donald Trump took office. The U.S. focus on North Korea has been sharpened by dozens of North Korean missile launches and two nuclear bomb tests since the beginning of last year and by Pyongyang's vow to develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. South Korea's top national security adviser said last week that Seoul did not aim to change its agreement on the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system to protect against North Korea, despite a decision to delay its full installation. Chung Eui-yong called the decision to delay installation of remaining launchers of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, system, pending a review of its environmental impact, a domestic measure to ensure a democratic process.

The agreement, to be filed as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill, is intended to punish Russia over issues including its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for the government of Syria in that country's six-year-long civil war. [L1N1J41LS] The Iran bill is due come up for a vote as soon as this week. Besides the provision setting up a process for Congress to review changes in sanctions, the measure would put into law sanctions previously established via presidential executive order, including some on certain Russian energy projects and debt financing in some industries. It would impose new sanctions on Russians found to be guilty of human rights abuses, supplying weapons to Syria's government and conduct cyber attacks on behalf of Russia's government, among others. The measure also would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. National flags of Russia and the U.S. fly at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, Russia April 11, 2017.Maxim ShemetovThe legislation is backed by both Republicans and Democrats, and is expected to easily pass the Senate. It was introduced amid an intense focus in the U.S. capital on relations with Russia, and investigations by the Department of Justice and congressional committees of whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. elections to help elect Republican President Donald Trump, and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow as it sought to influence the election.  To become law, the legislation would have to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump. If Trump objected, some of its backers said they expected enough congressional support to override a veto.  These additional sanctions will ... send a powerful and bipartisan statement to Russia and any other country who might try to interfere in our elections that they will be punished,  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Russia has denied attempting to interfere in the U.S election, and Trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. The measure also authorizes  robust assistance  to strengthen democratic institutions and counter disinformation in European countries that might be targeted by what the legislation's sponsors described as Russian aggression. In December, the final full month of President Barack Obama's administration, Washington sanctioned Russian businessmen and companies for Moscow's role in Ukraine via executive order.

The South Korean automaker also said it would launch an electric version of the Kona small SUV next year and a new large SUV by 2020 in a bid to catch up with rivals in the booming SUV segment. Hyundai looks like missing its annual sales target for a third consecutive year due to the unpopularity of its mainstay small sedans and political tensions between Beijing and Seoul which have battered sales in China, its biggest market. The automaker previously sold subcompact SUVs only in emerging markets, missing out on strong growth in the segment in South Korea, the United States and Europe. The subcompact SUV segment is the top-performing segment, growing an annual average of 46 percent from 2010 to 2016, Hyundai said, citing IHS Automotive data. In South Korea, the Kona, which is positioned below Hyundai's Tucson compact SUV, features a 1.6-litre gasoline or diesel engine and competes with Ssangyong Motor's Tivoli, Renault's QM3 and GM's Trax. Hyundai is targeting annual production of 135,000 Kona models in South Korea next year, after shifting some output of lower-margin Accent cars to Kia Motors' factory in Mexico, a source told Reuters. Hyundai and its affiliate Kia in January said they aimed to increase global sales by 5 percent this year, but their combined sales fell 7 percent from January to May this year, hit by slowing sales in China and the United States. In China, negative sentiment stemming from Seoul's decision to deploy a U.S. anti-missile system exacerbated its sales fall in the country, where it is already suffering from a lack of SUV line-ups and poor brand perception. In the United States, the automaker was one of the poorest performers through May, with sales down 4.8 percent in a market that fell 2.1 percent. The U.S. safety regulator has launched a probe into whether Hyundai and Kia recalled 1.7 million vehicles in a timely manner. In South Korea, its sales were nearly flat this year. Kia will join Hyundai in launching its subcompact SUV, Stonic, starting next month. The South Korean duo also plans to roll out full electric versions of the Kona next year, another person familiar with the plan previously told Reuters.

Such discussion is exactly the goal of our civically-engaged theater,  it said in a statement.  Our production of Julius Caesar in no way advocates violence towards anyone. Shakespeare's play, and our production, make the opposite point: those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save,  the theater said.     Delta and Bank of America ended their support of the production on Sunday, hours after Trump's son Donald Jr.  questioned in a tweet whether it was art or political speech.  Disappointed in @Delta for turning its back on free expression. I've flown many thousands of miles with you. No more,  tweeted Beau Willimon, an American playwright and creator of the popular Netflix series  House of Cards.  Novelist Joyce Carol Oates tweeted that she would see the play  in thrilled defiance of ignorant would-be censors.  Actor Ron Perlman, known for his big-screen depiction of  Hellboy,  also condemned the two former sponsors.  Act accordingly,  Perlman told his followers on Twitter. 'Crossed the Line' On Sunday, Delta Air Lines said it pulled its support because the production  crossed the line on the standards of good taste,  while Bank of America said the play was presented in a manner intended to provoke and offend.  Had this intention been made known to us, we would have decided not to sponsor it,  the bank's statement said. The two companies also received support on social media.  Kudos to @Delta for pulling $$ from 'play' portraying assassination of @POTUS,  former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, a Republican whose daughter is deputy White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter.  No one should sponsor crap like that!  The National Endowment for the Arts said in a statement that while it had given the New York Shakespeare Festival $320,000 over the past four years, no NEA funds were awarded to support the Public Theater's production of  Julius Caesar.   American Express Co (AXP.N), which calls itself  the official card of The Public Theater,  said on Monday it did not support this version of  Julius Caesar,  but did not say if it would drop funding.  The Public Theater puts on many shows. Our sponsorship does not go toward the funding of the production of Shakespeare in the Park and we do not condone thisÂ interpretation of the play,  American Express said in a statement. Comedian Kathy Griffin faced a backlash in recent weeks after posing for a photograph with a fake severed and bloodied head resembling Trump.  After images were published on social media, Griffin lost sponsorships and jobs, including co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.

Sessions will likely face tough questions at the open Senate Intelligence Committee hearing over his dealings with Russian officials during the campaign and whether he had a role in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Until a statement on Monday from committee Chairman Richard Burr, a Republican, it had been unclear whether Sessions would testify in an open or closed setting. Initially, Sessions expected to testify in a closed-door session, said two sources familiar with the attorney general's thinking. But he left the decision up to Burr, the sources said. A Justice Department spokeswoman said that Sessions requested the open setting because  he believes it is important for the American people to hear the truth directly from him.  Comey told the same panel last week that the FBI had information in mid-February on Sessions that would have made it  problematic  for the attorney general to continue leading a federal probe into Russian attempts to influence the presidential election. Sessions recused himself from that inquiry in March after media reports that he had been in two previously undisclosed meetings last year with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Tuesday's testimony, scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT), will be the first for Sessions in a congressional hearing since he became attorney general. During his nomination hearing in January, the former senator told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had no contacts with Russian officials as part of the Trump campaign. Sessions is likely to be questioned over the truthfulness of his answers in January. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses the National Law Enforcement Conference on Human Exploitation in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 6, 2017.Chris Aluka BerryA spokesman for the Justice Department said after media reports emerged in March of the meetings that Sessions had answered honestly because the encounters were part of his job as a senator and not as a surrogate of the Trump campaign.     Most Senior Official to Testify Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of both the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees, has said Sessions should answer questions about his January testimony.  U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses the National Law Enforcement Conference on Human Exploitation in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 6, 2017.Chris Aluka BerryIntelligence Committee members will also likely ask Sessions about a possible third undisclosed meeting with Kislyak that is now under investigation, according to media reports. Sessions, an early supporter of Trump's election campaign, will be the most senior government official to testify to the committee on the Russia issue, which has dogged the Republican president's early months in office. Critics charged that by firing Comey on May 9, Trump was trying to hinder the FBI's Russia probe. The former FBI chief added fuel to that accusation with his testimony last week. Trump has denied he tried to interfere with the probe.       In his testimony, Comey said he had asked Sessions not to leave him alone with Trump following meetings where he said Trump had asked Comey for his loyalty. The attorney general may also face questions on that. Media reports last week said Sessions offered to resign because of tensions with Trump over his decision to recuse himself from the FBI's Russia probe. The allegations are being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller and several congressional panels, including the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, last traded at 97.245, staying above a seven-month low of 96.511 set last week. The Canadian dollar touched its strongest in about two months at C$1.3287 per U.S. dollar at one point, extending its gains after climbing more than 1 percent on Monday. The loonie got a lift after a senior Bank of Canada official raised the prospect that an interest rate rise could come sooner than anticipated. The market's focus this week is on central bank meetings, with the Fed's two-day policy meeting set to start later on Tuesday. With the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise interest rates, investors' focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of further tightening in the months to come, and its assessment of the economy and outlook on inflation. Investors will also be watching for any fresh details on the Fed's plans for trimming its balance sheet.  Given that the minutes (of the last Fed meeting) contained lots of details, one possible scenario is that there will be an announcement in June and that it will start in September,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist for Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, referring to the Fed's possible balance sheet reduction. If that turns out to be the case, U.S. yields and the dollar will probably edge higher, Yamamoto said. Elsewhere, the Bank of England is set to announce its interest rate decision on Thursday, and the Bank of Japan also holds a policy meeting on June 15-16. Against the yen, the dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 110.09 , having pulled back from a one-week high of 110.815 yen set on Friday. The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.1192. Sterling held steady at $1.2659, staying above Friday's low of $1.2636, its lowest level since mid-April. The pound had shed 2.3 percent in the previous two trading days following the shock results of Thursday's UK general election that left Prime Minister Theresa May short of a parliamentary majority, that would have strengthened her hand as Britain prepares for Brexit negotiations with Europe.

Speaking at an executive meeting of the PSDB, they said a decision to stick with Temer was based on the need to support his austerity measures in Congress to balance Brazil's overdrawn fiscal accounts. Temer's acquittal on Friday in an illegal campaign funding case dating from the 2014 election strengthened the president's position among some of those wavering in the PSDB.  With the PSDB on board, Temer is more likely to muster support for his economic measures and block any attempt to have the Supreme Court try him for corruption charges.  The PSDB will not at this time make any move to leave the  government,  Senator JosÃ© Serra, a former foreign minister in the Temer administration, told reporters.  We have to continue in the government to back the reforms that are helping the economy recover. Indicators are improving substantially,  the PSDB governor of ParanÃ¡ state, Beto Richa, told Reuters.

Senior PSDB leaders managed to hold back a movement by younger lawmakers who want to quit the government and pull the four PSDB ministers out of Temer's cabinet.   Many of the party's 46 lawmakers in the lower chamber of Congress wanted to abandon Temer's coalition. They are worried voters will punish them at the polls next year for being part of a government widely perceived as corrupt.  Our party has not won an election in 16 years and the electorate has changed a lot. Voters no longer tolerate traditional political practices,  said another PSDB leader, requesting anonymity to speak more freely.     Corruption allegations that led to the ousting of the PSDB's former leader and presidential candidate in 2014, AÃ©cio Neves, were a  bombshell  that weakened the party and made it imperative to take distance from Temer, he said.

State-run oil firm Saudi Aramco would supply full contracted crude volumes to at least five Asian buyers mainly in North Asia and lower volumes for some customers in India, China and South Korea, the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Cuts in crude allocations to Asia in July would total about 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), deeper than in June, the sources said. Aramco notified Asian refiners last month that it would reduce oil supplies to Asia by about 7 million barrels in June, its first cuts for that region since OPEC-led output reductions took effect in January. Elsewhere, crude allocations to the United States have been lowered significantly and Aramco continued to curtail supply to Europe, two sources said. One source said volumes to the United States would be cut by about 35 percent in July, while Europe supplies will be reduced by about 11 pct compared to June. One of Aramco's main buyers in China opted for lower nominations in July due to planned refinery maintenance and the more expensive Dubai benchmark, one of the sources said. Another North Asian customer said Aramco would supply full volumes of heavy crude for a third straight month. According to the July plans, Aramco would cut supplies to India by close to 200,000 bpd and China by about 110,000 bpd, while supplying full volumes to buyers in Japan and Taiwan, said one source with knowledge of the nominations. Supplies to one South Korean refiner were also reduced, two sources said. Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has cut oil output as part of a global supply pact and trimmed exports to meet rising domestic demand for power during the hot summer months. An OPEC-led agreement to curb global oil supplies was extended last month until March 2018. The agreement, which includes non-OPEC nations such as Russia, had initially been due to run during the first half of 2017. When OPEC announced the curbs last year, Saudi Arabia told its customers in Europe and the United States that they would receive lower volumes but shielded most of Asia from the cuts. However, power demand peaks during summer as residents turn up air conditioners in the desert kingdom where temperatures can reach as high as 50 degrees Celsius. This year is likely to see an earlier spike in demand as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan started in late May. Under the supply pact, OPEC states, Russia and other major producers agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million bpd. Saudi Arabia accounts for about 40 percent of the cuts pledged by OPEC. It has reduced output by more than 500,000 bpd so its total production now runs slightly below 10 million bpd. Industry sources told Reuters in April that higher domestic demand for oil in the summer would weigh on exports especially if Saudi Arabia kept output at about 10 million bpd. Saudi Arabia usually burns about 700,000 bpd of oil for power generation in the hottest months from May to August. This summer, the country may reduce domestic oil consumption as it plans to use more natural gas in power stations.

(Reuters) - A Pennsylvania prosecutor displayed in court on Monday three hours of security camera footage that she said showed members of a Penn State fraternity forcing pledges to engage in a ritual of heavy drinking that resulted in a teenager's death. Centre County District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller presented the graphic video at a hearing to help establish the state's case against 16 members of a Pennsylvania State University fraternity accused in the Feb. 4 hazing death of Timothy Piazza, 19. Two others charged in the case waived their rights to a preliminary hearing. The 18 defendants range in age from 19 to 22. Eight of them face felony aggravated-assault charges that could put them in prison for many years. The rest are charged with various misdemeanor offenses, including involuntary manslaughter. Piazza's parents, Evelyn and James Piazza of Lebanon, New Jersey, left the courtroom as prosecutors began playing the excerpted footage, which contained no sound. Piazza and others seeking to join Penn State's chapter of Beta Theta Pi had to participate in a game known of The Gauntlet, requiring them to drink excessive vodka, beer and wine, prosecutors say. The court watched in silence as video from the frat house showed Piazza in an apparent state of inebriation. He can be seen crawling, trying to stand and repeatedly falling to the floor, hitting his head. The young men charged in the case ignored the serious injuries Piazza suffered in a fall down a 15-foot staircase, State College Police Detective David Scicchitano testified. They carried him back up to the top and laid him on a couch but did not seek medical help until the next morning. By then, Piazza had fallen down the stairs again and lay there for two hours, until fraternity members found him nearly dead, Scicchitano said. Doctors told the detective that Piazza was likely in extreme pain.  At one point in the video, defendant Jonah Neuman, 19, is seen angrily shoving a fellow frat member who protested that Piazza might have a concussion. Scicchitano testified Neuman told his frat brother to âmind his own business.â Piazza died later at a hospital. An autopsy listed head and spleen injuries as the cause of death. Scicchitano was on the witness stand for much of the day. Magisterial District Judge Allen Sinclair granted a defense motion to continue the hearing to a later date to allow for additional cross-examination and testimony before ruling whether the case will proceed to trial.

Speaking at an executive meeting of the PSDB, they said a decision to stick with Temer was based on the need to support his austerity measures in Congress to balance Brazil's overdrawn fiscal accounts. Temer's acquittal on Friday in an illegal campaign funding case dating from the 2014 election strengthened the president's position among some of those wavering in the PSDB.  With the PSDB on board, Temer is more likely to muster support for his economic measures and block any attempt to have the Supreme Court try him for corruption charges.  The PSDB will not at this time make any move to leave the  government,  Senator JosÃ© Serra, a former foreign minister in the Temer administration, told reporters.  We have to continue in the government to back the reforms that are helping the economy recover. Indicators are improving substantially,  the PSDB governor of ParanÃ¡ state, Beto Richa, told Reuters.

Senior PSDB leaders managed to hold back a movement by younger lawmakers who want to quit the government and pull the four PSDB ministers out of Temer's cabinet.   Many of the party's 46 lawmakers in the lower chamber of Congress wanted to abandon Temer's coalition. They are worried voters will punish them at the polls next year for being part of a government widely perceived as corrupt.  Our party has not won an election in 16 years and the electorate has changed a lot. Voters no longer tolerate traditional political practices,  said another PSDB leader, requesting anonymity to speak more freely.

Mohammed Shaheldul Islam has limited diplomatic immunity and was ordered to surrender his passport when he appeared before Queens Supreme Court Justice Daniel Lewis, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown in a statement. Bail was set at $50,000 bond or $25,000 cash. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted. According to the indictment, Islam brought another Bangladeshi, Mohammed Amin, to New York between 2012 and 2013 to work as a household help for Islam and his family.  Soon after Mr. Amin's arrival, the defendant allegedly took his passport and required the man to work 18 hours a day ... Even though Mr. Amin had a contract which outlines his compensation, it is alleged he was never paid for his work,  the statement said.  If the victim disobeyed the defendant's orders, Mr. Amin was allegedly physically assaulted by the defendant, who either struck him with his hand or sometimes with a wooden shoe,  it said. A spokesman for the Bangladesh embassy in Washington said he had no information on the issue. The Bangladesh consulate in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An official of the U.S. State Department said it informed Bangladeshi officials of the arrest. Reuters was not able to determine if Islam had an attorney. According to the charges, Amin's only form of income came from tips from guests at parties and a  miniscule  amount of money Islam sent to Amin's family in Bangladesh. On several occasions when Amin sought to leave, Islam hit him and threatened to harm his mother and young son in Bangladesh, the statement said. On occasion, Islam also stated that he would have Amin's college-age daughter  shamed  if he did not continue to work as his servant, the statement said. The statement did not make clear what he meant by shaming. It said that in 2014, shortly after an Indian diplomat in New York was charged with labor trafficking, Islam wrote a check for Amin's cash-tip earnings that the latter then had to deposit in a bank account to create the appearance of a paycheck. In late 2013, Devyani Khobragade, who was India's deputy consul general in New York, was arrested and subsequently accused of visa fraud and forcing her housekeeper and nanny to work 100-hour weeks for just over $1 an hour. Khobragade's arrest and strip search provoked outrage in India and caused a major diplomatic rift between the United States and India. The charges against her were dismissed because she had diplomatic immunity, but after she left the United States, a New York grand jury later issued a new indictment for visa fraud.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-bangladesh-idUSL1N1JA021"},

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * tmsnrt.rs/2sTTjDx By Andy Home LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - Aluminium is still the star of the London Metal Exchange (LME) base metals complex, up by over 12 percent on the start of the year. After recording a two-year high of $1,981 per tonne in March, LME three-month metal has eased slightly but is largely holding its ground around the $1,900 level. Compare and contrast with the likes of copper and zinc, both of which have wilted on growing concerns about renewed slowdown in China's construction and manufacturing sectors. Aluminium is taking a different cue from China, pinning its hopes on what Beijing calls  supply-side reform  to force production cuts in the world's largest producer. The money men are largely keeping the faith with this narrative, holding a net long position LME-AH-MNET of 167,725 contracts as of June 1. That's down from a peak of more than 200,000 contracts at the end of March, but still high by historical standards, which means since the LME introduced its positioning reports in July 2014. But should fund managers be worried by indications of softness in the physical market? Graphic on Japanese quarterly premiums: tmsnrt.rs/2sTTjDx Japan Premium Falls Japanese buyers are in the process of concluding deals for shipments in the third quarter at a premium of $119 per tonne over LME cash prices. That's down from $128 per tonne for second-quarter shipments and marks the end of a broader bounce in premiums over the first half of this year. The drop in Japanese premiums is surprising given a double dose of production disruption in Australia, a key supplier to the Asian market. Output in the  Oceania  region, which denotes Australia plus the Tomago smelter in New Zealand, slumped by more than 12 percent in the first four months of this year, according to the International Aluminium Institute. That reflects one outage and one capacity curtailment. The Portland smelter in the state of Victoria was badly impacted by a power outage in December last year. It lost around two-thirds of its 300,000-tonne per year operating capacity and has only just managed to restore around half of that. Full production is only likely in August, according to majority owner and operator Alcoa. Rio Tinto's majority-owned Boyne smelter in the state of Queensland has trimmed production by around 15 percent or 80,000 tonnes this year after failing to get a sufficiently competitive power supply contract. The scare in the last few days about shipments from the Qatalum smelter in Qatar, another supplier to the Asian region, probably came too late to impact the Q3 premium negotiations. But it may not have mattered much anyway. Lme Stocks Feed Supply Every indication is that the Asian region is well-supplied, if not oversupplied. In part this is down to the steady flow of metal out of the LME warehouse system. LME headline aluminium inventory fell by almost 700,000 tonnes last year and it is already down by more than that this year. Although the unwind of structural load-out queues at the Dutch port of Vlissingen is a key driver of falling stocks, a lot of the recent aluminium activity has taken place at good-delivery locations in Asia. There have been  flash  queues at  Busan in South Korea and Port Klang in Malaysia in recent months. And only a part of what has been withdrawn from the LME has gone anywhere near a downstream aluminium processor. Significant tonnages have been moved to the United States to capitalise on what were higher premiums in that market place. That trade appears to have lost momentum as the Midwest premium has slipped from its first-quarter highs above 10 cents-per-lb ($220 per tonne) to a current 8.5 cents, basis the CME's premium contract. Which leaves a lot of ex-LME metal sitting in off-market sheds in the Asian region and being drip-fed into the physical market as stocks financing deals expire. If this were the only pressure point on regional premiums, aluminium bulls wouldn't have much to worry about. The dynamics behind the LME stocks declines are well understood and this is ultimately no more than a geographical distribution of what everyone knew was already there. Chinese Exports Crank Back Up A more worrying development is what appears to be a new surge in Chinese exports of semi-manufactured products ( semis ). The preliminary snapshot of May's trade figures showed aggregate exports of unwrought aluminium and semis rising to 460,000 tonnes from 430,000 tonnes in April. April's exports of semis products at 380,000 tonnes were the largest monthly tally since November 2015 and the implication is that, barring an unlikely burst in exports of either metal or alloy, they rose further in May. It's not an entirely surprising outcome given lots of evidence China's giant aluminium machine is cranking back up again. The official figures supplied by the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association show national production rising by 12.5 percent in the first four months of this year. There are plenty of analysts who think even that growth rate looks too slow. As ever when China generates more aluminium than it can use itself, exports of semis act as a pressure valve. The impact this time around, however, might be accentuated by the fact that China's outbound flows have shifted shape from Trade Code 7604 (bars, rods and profiles) to Code 7606 (plate, sheet and strip). Exports of 7604 have in the past been inflated by a significant flow of what the market has dubbed  fake  semis to Vietnam. This material has been on a world tour but is now back in Vietnam, still not in danger of going anywhere near the global supply chain. The fear is that this latest surge in Chinese exports, by contrast, is bona fide product that will have an immediate displacement effect on regional physical market dynamics. Tension There is a tension building between the bull narrative of future Chinese production cuts and the current acceleration in exports. Make no mistake. The prospect of significant aluminium production capacity being closed by Chinese policy-makers is an unprecedented supply side shock for aluminium, even if the scale of the threat is still very hard to determine. But the drop in Japanese premiums suggests that physical availability is growing, not diminishing. And it will continue doing so as long as China pumps out more semis into the world market. Bulls aren't panicking yet. That much is evident from the LME price. But they may want to keep a close eye on China's export flows over the coming few months.

Asset managers cut their combined net long position in the three main futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 39 million barrels in the week ending June 6 (tmsnrt.rs/2ske0ve). The net position had been increased by a total of 114 million barrels over the previous three weeks, analysis of data published by regulators and exchanges showed (tmsnrt.rs/2rRLXld). The earlier increase, however, was driven mostly by covering of short positions rather than the creation of new longs, and the short-covering now seems to have run its course. Hedge funds added 24 million barrels of new short positions in the most recent week, all in Brent, where shorts rose by 33 million barrels. The ratio of long to short positions fell to only 3.1 to 1, well short of the recent peak of 5.8 on April 18, let alone the record 10.3 set in February (tmsnrt.rs/2rRVQiS). From a positioning perspective, the balance of risks is now on the upside, with few long positions left to be liquidated and a relatively large number of short positions that need to be covered. Brent prices are trading close to their lowest since OPEC announced it was cutting output on Nov. 30, which also suggests some potential for a bounce in the short term. Saudi Arabia has offered some rhetorical support by reiterating its determination to bring global oil stocks down to the five-year average, though policymakers have so far resisted pressure to cut output again. But the continued rise in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has made it hard for fund managers to become bullish again. The number of rigs targeting oil-bearing formations has more than doubled over the past 12 months, even though WTI prices are down by about 6 percent. The rig count has continued to climb even after WTI prices peaked in February and started to decline (tmsnrt.rs/2rmxAli). Since production lags the rig count by six months, the recent increase in drilling will ensure that U.S. output continues rising for the remainder of 2017 and into 2018. The U.S. Energy Information Administration now forecasts output will increase by 460,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, up from the 110,000 bpd rise forecast in January. The agency expects production to rise by a further 680,000 bpd in 2018, against the 300,000 bpd forecast in January. With so much extra production projected to come from the United States, with output also increasing from Brazil, Norway, Libya and Nigeria, sentiment among hedge fund managers remains tepid. Fund managers have established large net long positions in crude twice this year, only for prices to drop sharply, leaving them with heavy losses. Many want firmer evidence that the market really is rebalancing before taking on risk again and going long for a third time.

Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the two main futures and options contracts linked to Henry Hub prices by 765 billion cubic feet in the week to June 6. Fund managers cut their net long position by a total of 1,349 billion cubic feet over the two weeks since May 23, after boosting positions by 1,721 billion cubic feet over the previous 12 weeks (tmsnrt.rs/2rRAYZa). By May 23, hedge funds had accumulated a near-record net long position of 3,919 billion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (tmsnrt.rs/2sTeDch). Fund managers had the biggest bullish bias on record, with more than five long positions for every short position (tmsnrt.rs/2rmwMwV). But the concentration of hedge fund long positions left prices looking stretched and vulnerable to a correction. Fund managers gambled that strong exports coupled with a new wave of combined-cycle power plants would tighten gas stocks this summer. But instead stocks have risen in line with the normal seasonal pattern as power producers have switched back to burning coal. With ample stocks, the bullish bias among the hedge fund managers was no longer sustainable and a correction became inevitable. Turning Point Spot prices and calendar spreads peaked in the middle of May, and started to soften gradually, before tumbling after May 22. Gentle liquidation of long positions by former hedge fund bulls has been accelerated by a new wave of short selling from hedge fund bears anticipating a price correction. Hedge fund long positions were reduced by 453 billion cubic feet over the two weeks ending on June 6, but fund managers also established 896 billion cubic feet of new short positions. Gas prices have fallen sharply to encourage electricity generators to run their gas-fired power plants for more hours and ease back on coal burning. Nearly all the decline in prices has been concentrated in near-dated futures contracts to encourage maximum power burn this summer. The price of gas for delivery at Henry Hub in July 2017 has fallen by more than 40 cents per million British thermal units, around 12 percent, since May 22 (tmsnrt.rs/2rRvNIz). By contrast, there has been little change in forward prices, with the price of gas for delivered in July 2018 down by just 2 cents since May 22. Calendar spreads have collapsed, with the backwardation from July 2017 to July 2018 easing from 47 cents on May 22 to just 9 cents on June 12 (tmsnrt.rs/2rmq3mx). The sharp reduction in hedge fund long positions and establishment of a significant number of new short ones has left the risks around gas prices looking much more balanced. Gas prices are now much more competitive with coal, which should encourage power producers to run their combined-cycle units for more hours as baseload and limit further downside risks.

Andy Home","keywords":"Australia,China,Malaysia,New Zealand,Qatar,South Korea,United States,Vietnam,US,ALUMINIUM,PREMIUMS,AHOME,Commentaries,Japan,Aluminium,Base Metals,Financial and Commodity Market Operators (TRBC),Asia / Pacific,English,Government Borrowing Requirement,Metals and Mining (TRBC),Europe,Regulation,United Kingdom,Reports","sector":"","content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Aluminum is still the star of the London Metal Exchange (LME) base metals complex, up by over 12 percent on the start of the year.  After recording a two-year high of $1,981 per tonne in March, LME three-month metal has eased slightly but is largely holding its ground around the $1,900 level.   Compare and contrast with the likes of copper and zinc, both of which have wilted on growing concerns about renewed slowdown in China's construction and manufacturing sectors.  Aluminum is taking a different cue from China, pinning its hopes on what Beijing calls  supply-side reform  to force production cuts in the world's largest producer.  The money men are largely keeping the faith with this narrative, holding a net long position of 167,725 contracts as of June 1. That's down from a peak of more than 200,000 contracts at the end of March, but still high by historical standards, which means since the LME introduced its positioning reports in July 2014.  But should fund managers be worried by indications of softness in the physical market? Graphic on Japanese quarterly premiums:  tmsnrt.rs/2sTTjDx Japan Premium Falls Japanese buyers are in the process of concluding deals for shipments in the third quarter at a premium of $119 per tonne over LME cash prices. That's down from $128 per tonne for second-quarter shipments and marks the end of a broader bounce in premiums over the first half of this year. The drop in Japanese premiums is surprising given a double dose of production disruption in Australia, a key supplier to the Asian market.  Output in the  Oceania  region, which denotes Australia plus the Tomago smelter in New Zealand, slumped by more than 12 percent in the first four months of this year, according to the International Aluminum Institute.  That reflects one outage and one capacity curtailment.  The Portland smelter in the state of Victoria was badly impacted by a power outage in December last year. It lost around two-thirds of its 300,000-tonne per year operating capacity and has only just managed to restore around half of that. Full production is only likely in August, according to majority owner and operator Alcoa. Rio Tinto's majority-owned Boyne smelter in the state of Queensland has trimmed production by around 15 percent or 80,000 tonnes this year after failing to get a sufficiently competitive power supply contract. The scare in the last few days about shipments from the Qatalum smelter in Qatar, another supplier to the Asian region, probably came too late to impact the Q3 premium negotiations. But it may not have mattered much anyway.  Lme Stocks Feed Supply Every indication is that the Asian region is well-supplied, if not oversupplied. In part this is down to the steady flow of metal out of the LME warehouse system.   LME headline aluminum inventory fell by almost 700,000 tonnes last year and it is already down by more than that this year.  Although the unwind of structural load-out queues at the Dutch port of Vlissingen is a key driver of falling stocks, a lot of the recent aluminum activity has taken place at good-delivery locations in Asia. There have been  flash  queues at  Busan in South Korea and Port Klang in Malaysia in recent months.  And only a part of what has been withdrawn from the LME has gone anywhere near a downstream aluminum processor.  Significant tonnages have been moved to the United States to capitalize on what were higher premiums in that market place.  That trade appears to have lost momentum as the Midwest premium has slipped from its first-quarter highs above 10 cents-per-lb ($220 per tonne) to a current 8.5 cents, basis the CME's premium contract.  Which leaves a lot of ex-LME metal sitting in off-market sheds in the Asian region and being drip-fed into the physical market as stocks financing deals expire.  If this were the only pressure point on regional premiums, aluminum bulls wouldn't have much to worry about.  The dynamics behind the LME stocks declines are well understood and this is ultimately no more than a geographical distribution of what everyone knew was already there.  Chinese Exports Crank Back Up A more worrying development is what appears to be a new surge in Chinese exports of semi-manufactured products ( semis ).  The preliminary snapshot of May's trade figures showed aggregate exports of unwrought aluminum and semis rising to 460,000 tonnes from 430,000 tonnes in April. April's exports of semis products at 380,000 tonnes were the largest monthly tally since November 2015 and the implication is that, barring an unlikely burst in exports of either metal or alloy, they rose further in May.  It's not an entirely surprising outcome given lots of evidence China's giant aluminum machine is cranking back up again.  The official figures supplied by the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association show national production rising by 12.5 percent in the first four months of this year. There are plenty of analysts who think even that growth rate looks too slow.  As ever when China generates more aluminum than it can use itself, exports of semis act as a pressure valve.  The impact this time around, however, might be accentuated by the fact that China's outbound flows have shifted shape from Trade Code 7604 (bars, rods and profiles) to Code 7606 (plate, sheet and strip).  Exports of 7604 have in the past been inflated by a significant flow of what the market has dubbed  fake  semis to Vietnam. This material has been on a world tour but is now back in Vietnam, still not in danger of going anywhere near the global supply chain. The fear is that this latest surge in Chinese exports, by contrast, is bona fide product that will have an immediate displacement effect on regional physical market dynamics.  Tension There is a tension building between the bull narrative of future Chinese production cuts and the current acceleration in exports.  Make no mistake. The prospect of significant aluminum production capacity being closed by Chinese policy-makers is an unprecedented supply side shock for aluminum, even if the scale of the threat is still very hard to determine.  But the drop in Japanese premiums suggests that physical availability is growing, not diminishing. And it will continue doing so as long as China pumps out more semis into the world market.  Bulls aren't panicking yet. That much is evident from the LME price. But they may want to keep a close eye on China's export flows over the coming few months.

The farmers of TR Crop Watch â which features weekly, real-life check-ins with two farmers in Illinois and one in Minnesota [nL1N1IY0UK] â reported that last week's warm temperatures were favorable for the development of their crops.  The lack of rain was not ideal, but there is rain in the forecast over the next several days, which should ease the farmersâ worries for now. The farmers also used last weekâs mini-rally in Chicago corn futures to market some of their crop â particularly last yearâs crop â as many U.S. growers still have a lot of 2016 grain in the bins with the hopes of prices moving higher. Before last week, the producers had sold 25 percent, 35 percent and 65 percent of their 2016 corn, and between 0 and 10 percent of 2017 corn. (Those percentages are listed in random order of the three producers, to protect their privacy.) But as of Monday they have sold 30 percent, 50 percent and 90 percent of their old crop. They also marketed between 5 and 14 percent of their 2017 corn in the last several days. The growers - known as Farmers A, B and C - will assign a condition score every week to each field, similar to the system used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The ratings are: excellent â 5, good â 4, fair â 3, poor â 2, very poor â 1. They will also give their best estimation of yield potential. The yield ratings are: yields well above average â 5, slightly above â 4, average â 3, slightly below â 2, well below average â 1. Farmer a â East Central Illinois Farmer A corn, June 4 versus June 12: reut.rs/2rnuEoK Farmer A soybeans, June 4 versus June 12: tmsnrt.rs/2sUrj2D Farmer Aâs corn doubled in height between June 4 and June 11, and now stands around 24 inches (0.61 m) tall. The corn is rapidly growing at this stage and A notes it looks better every day. Aâs soybeans also doubled in height last week and are now 6 inches (152 mm) tall. He assigned a bean condition rating of 4 â up from 3 last week â and a yield rating of 3, which is unchanged. He rates his corn condition as a 4, the same as last week, but he now rates the yield at a 3 instead of 4 as he did last week. Some of the uncertainty in Aâs area stems from the recent dryness as other nearby producers have also expressed the need for some rain, though that should be on the way in the coming days should the forecasts as of Monday morning be realized. Farmer B â South Central Minnesota Farmer B corn, June 4 versus June 11: tmsnrt.rs/2rmQjgL Farmer B soybeans, June 4 versus June 11: reut.rs/2rRXEbH Farmer Bâs corn is now 12 inches (205 mm) tall, a big departure from the 4.5 inches (114 mm) on June 4, and B was generally happy with the progress this week. On Tuesday, B sprayed this corn field with post-emergence weed control. Temperatures turned very warm toward the end of the week and he noticed some leaf rolling late on Friday and Saturday. Although he would like some rain now, B is still optimistic about his corn and left his 5 rating on condition and 4 rating on yield unchanged from last week. B also rated his soybeans in the exact same way, unchanged from last week. On June 11, his soybeans stood 5 inches (127 mm) tall compared with 2 inches (51 mm) on June 4. Most producers in Bâs area were happy over the past week with the progress of their crops, which could now use around 0.75 inch (19 mm) of rainfall for safe-keeping. However, the need for rain in Bâs area is nowhere near as critical now as it is in other parts of the Corn Belt. Farmer C â Southeastern Illinois Farmer C corn, June 4 versus June 11: reut.rs/2sTTNt2 Farmer C corn, June 11, different part of field: reut.rs/2ska65i Farmer C soybeans, June 4 versus June 11: tmsnrt.rs/2sTMamm Farmer Câs crops are in the most precarious position of the three producers and need rain the most. The past week was warm and sunny â good for crop growth â but also dry and windy.  Câs corn was 36 inches (0.91 m) tall on June 11, compared with the previous weekâs 26 inches (0.66 m). Soil quality varies throughout Câs fields, and the parts of his corn field on the lower-quality ground are showing definite signs of stress. Temperatures last week topped 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) and winds exceeded 20 miles per hour (32 km per hour), which caused the corn on lower-quality soil to roll up their leaves, giving them a spiky look. This happens when corn is short of moisture. At this point, Câs corn and bean fields need a good inch (25 mm) of rainfall this week as anything less will not be enough to make a difference. Farmer C said a dry June is not usually detrimental, but it can be if heavy rain is dumped on the crop after planting as happened with corn this year. Câs soybeans stand 10 inches (16 mm) tall compared with 6 inches (152 mm) in the week before. Last week he coated the field with fertilizer. Some of the soybean leaves have started to turn over, exposing the underside, which is a moisture-conservation technique used by the plant. C says his soybeans also need rain, but not as desperately as his corn. Farmer C also notes some producers in his area are having trouble getting their soybeans out of the ground as they were planted in dry dirt and have not received enough moisture to sprout. Rain is also critical for both crops at this point because it helps distribute the weed-killing chemicals that the farmers apply into the soils. As of June 11, Farmer C maintains his 4-rating on condition and yield for both crops, but notes the corn ratings would likely drop to 3 by next week if the forecasted rains prove to be disappointing.

Asset managers cut their combined net long position in the three main futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 39 million barrels in the week ending June 6 (tmsnrt.rs/2ske0ve). The net position had been increased by a total of 114 million barrels over the previous three weeks, analysis of data published by regulators and exchanges showed (tmsnrt.rs/2rRLXld). The earlier increase, however, was driven mostly by covering of short positions rather than the creation of new longs, and the short-covering now seems to have run its course. Hedge funds added 24 million barrels of new short positions in the most recent week, all in Brent, where shorts rose by 33 million barrels. The ratio of long to short positions fell to only 3.1 to 1, well short of the recent peak of 5.8 on April 18, let alone the record 10.3 set in February (tmsnrt.rs/2rRVQiS). From a positioning perspective, the balance of risks is now on the upside, with few long positions left to be liquidated and a relatively large number of short positions that need to be covered. Brent prices are trading close to their lowest since OPEC announced it was cutting output on Nov. 30, which also suggests some potential for a bounce in the short term. Saudi Arabia has offered some rhetorical support by reiterating its determination to bring global oil stocks down to the five-year average, though policymakers have so far resisted pressure to cut output again. But the continued rise in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has made it hard for fund managers to become bullish again. The number of rigs targeting oil-bearing formations has more than doubled over the past 12 months, even though WTI prices are down by about 6 percent. The rig count has continued to climb  even after WTI prices peaked in February and started to decline (tmsnrt.rs/2rmxAli). Since production lags the rig count by six months, the recent increase in drilling will ensure that U.S. output continues rising for the remainder of 2017 and into 2018. The U.S. Energy Information Administration now forecasts output will increase by 460,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, up from the 110,000 bpd rise forecast in January. The agency expects production to rise by a further 680,000 bpd in 2018, against the 300,000 bpd forecast in January. With so much extra production projected to come from the United States, with output also increasing from Brazil, Norway, Libya and Nigeria, sentiment among hedge fund managers remains tepid. Fund managers have established large net long positions in crude twice this year, only for prices to drop sharply, leaving them with heavy losses. Many want firmer evidence that the market really is rebalancing before taking on risk again and going long for a third time.

Brent crude futures were at $48.42 per barrel at 0044 GMT, up 13 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $46.21 per barrel, also up 13 cents, or 0.3 percent. Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, is leading an effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of the first quarter of 2018 in order to prop up prices. Other countries, including top producer Russia, are also participating. During the first half of the year, there were doubts over OPEC's compliance with its own pledges, as supplies, especially to Asia, remained high. Saudi officials now say they are making real cuts, including 300,000 bpd to Asia for July, although several Asian refiners said they were still receiving their full allocations.  Crude oil prices rose on the back of further supportive talk from Saudi Arabia. Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said that inventories are declining and reductions will accelerate in the next three week,  ANZ bank said. Although other OPEC members, like Libya and Nigeria, are exempt from the cuts, and there have been doubts over the compliance of others, including Iraq, the club's supplies have been falling since the the cut's start in January. Trade data shows that OPEC shipments to customers averaged around 26 million bpd in the last six months of 2016, while they are set to average around 25.3 million bpd in the first half of this year. Threatening to undermine OPEC's efforts to tighten the market is a relentless rise in U.S. drilling activity RIG-OL-USA-BHI, which has driven up U.S. output C-OUT-T-EIA by more than 10 percent since mid-2016, to over 9.3 million bpd. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) says production will rise above 10 million bpd by next year, challenging top exporter Saudi Arabia. Overall, oil markets remain well supplied. A sign of ample supplies is the Brent forward curve , which is in a shape known as contango, in which crude for delivery in half a year's time is around $1.50 per barrel more expensive than that for immediate dispatch, making it profitable to charter tankers and store fuel instead of selling it for direct use.

Mnuchin,Donald J. Trump,Lisa Donner,Sherrod Brown,Steven T. Mnuchin,USA,BANKS/REGULATION,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled a sweeping plan on Monday to upend the country's financial regulatory framework, which, if successful, would grant many items on Wall Street's wishlist. The nearly 150-page report that suggested more than 100 changes, most of which would be made through regulators rather than Congress. Republican President Donald Trump has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission to carry out his agenda. The changes suggested include easing up on restrictions big banks now face in their trading operations, lightening the annual stress tests they must undergo, and reducing the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been aggressively pursuing bad behavior by financial institutions. The industry has long sought such changes, which would benefit banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley. The plan would also expand the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is chaired by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It would also change the way global capital standards are implemented at home to give U.S. banks a leg up against foreign rivals. Smaller banks also would get some relief. Lenders with $50 billion or less in assets would have to jump through fewer regulatory hoops than rivals with multi-trillion-dollar balance sheets. Trade groups for large and small banks applauded the administration's proposals on Monday evening, though some said they wished there were more specifics on tricky questions, such as what level regulators should set for banks' assets before subjecting them to stricter regulations.  This is the first time in a while where there's been an official undertaking where our concerns resonated with the folks in the driver's seat,  said Rich Foster, senior counsel for regulatory and legal affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade group. However, reform advocates and Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the plan as a handout to Wall Street and a dangerous one for U.S. consumers who lost homes and jobs during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  The Treasury proposal advances ideas that have been pushed by industry lobbyists since Dodd-Frank was passed,  said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform.  We need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders.  Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown noted that the Treasury Department consulted with industry groups more than consumer groups, by a ratio of 17-to-1 while developing the report. In a statement, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the regulatory overhaul is needed to grow the economy, give consumers more choices and ensure U.S. taxpayers would not have to bail out big banks again. While the Trump administration has said it wants to protect consumers, existing rules limit their access to loans and investment products they want. If the Trump administration succeeds in making changes through regulatory agencies, it can avoid a lengthy and perhaps futile battle among lawmakers. Although the White House and Congress are led by Republicans, Democrats in the Senate can block legislation and are unlikely to support any overhaul that eases rules on big banks. Many changes proposed by the Treasury Department would undo rules put in place by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a landmark set of post-crisis laws signed by Obama, who is Trump's predecessor. Dodd-Frank required banks to hold more capital and liquidity, implemented annual stress tests and put restrictions around the types of trading and investments they could make. It also set up the CFPB and put other consumer protections in place.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-regulation-idUSL1N1J91W6"},

One by one, Trump's Cabinet members assembled around the table spoke effusively about the president as he sat beaming, soaking it all in at the first formal gathering of his most senior officials at the White House on Monday. The lavishing of praise and adulation contrasted with the storm enveloping the president as he struggles with myriad crises, including an investigation into possible ties between his election campaign and Russian meddling in the race.  For him, the meeting was a welcome rendering of what he feels are major accomplishments ignored by his detractors, even though major legislative achievements have eluded him thus far. There was no one more gushing than White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is frequently the target of criticism from long-time Trump advisers and is often see as just one misstep away from being ousted, even though rumors of his departure have all proved to be premature.  On behalf of the entire senior staff around you, Mr. President, we thank you for the honor and the blessing that youâve given us to serve your agenda and the American people and weâre continuing to work very hard every day to accomplish those goals,  Priebus said. Trump used the meeting to try to show a sense of momentum for his agenda after weeks of being engulfed in controversy over his May 9 firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was heading the Russia investigation. âWeâve been about as active as you can possibly be and at a just about record pace,â he said.  In just a very short time we are seeing amazing results. People are surprised. Itâs kicking in very fast.â U.S. President Donald Trump smiles during a meeting with members of his Cabinet at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 12, 2017.Kevin LamarqueBut one of his greatest adversaries, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, put together a mock video of a meeting with his staff with aides praising Schumer.  Michelle, how'd my hair look coming out of the gym this morning?  Schumer asks, turning to one staffer. Slideshow (4 Images) You have great hair. Nobody has better hair than you,  Michelle said. Priebus was not alone in using the opportunity to praise Trump. âIt is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president. The president is keeping his word to the American people,  said Vice President Mike Pence. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, noting the comments from other officials who said they had recently been abroad, noted wryly: âWhile we are bragging about international travel I just got back from Mississippi and they like you there.â U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who as governor of South Carolina had endorsed Trump opponent Marco Rubio last year, called it  a new day at the United Nations  with Trump in power.  We now have a very strong voice. People know what the United States is for. They know what we are against. And they see us in a new way across the board. I think the international community knows we are back,  she said. Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Mary Milliken","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cabinet-idUSKBN19400P"},

City officials hope the effort will keep tens of thousands of people out of the city's criminal courts each year, treating the offenses in most cases as civil matters punishable by a fines or community service. The effort is also intended to prevent some immigrants from being targeted by federal agents for deportation, officials said.      U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order in January expanding the focus of immigration agents to include the removal of immigrants charged with a crime, even before any conviction. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has been critical of Trump's immigration policies, and the city has often refused to cooperate with federal deportation efforts by not turning over suspects, a policy that predated Trump's presidency.  In the civil system, there is no chance of immigration consequences,  Sarah Solon, a deputy director for the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice, said in an email. Before Tuesday, people caught urinating in public could end up having a criminal misdemeanor on their records and their fingerprints shared automatically with federal law enforcement agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Groups representing immigrant New Yorkers, including the Legal Aid Society and the New York Civil Liberties Union, have argued that the New York Police Department's focus on  minor, non-violent offenses was unnecessarily exposing the city's large immigrant population to a risk of deportation.  Some 18,000 people were detained or issued criminal summons for public urination last year. For drinking alcohol in public, that number was 90,000. The city does not record how many of those people were immigrants. The police department was obliged to come up with the new rules under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, spearheaded by City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and signed by the mayor a year ago. The council negotiated the new rules with the police department and the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice over the past year.   I think it helped make our case a little better for us,  Mark-Viverito said in a telephone interview, referring to Trump's election last November.      Police can still issue criminal charges for such minor offenses against people on parole or who have been arrested at least twice for felonies in the previous two years.

The changes are part of a settlement announced on Monday in federal court in Phoenix in a 2014 lawsuit brought by seven death row inmates who argued Arizona's lethal injection practices were experimental, secretive and caused inmates prolonged suffering. Dale Baich, a lawyer for the litigants in the case, said the settlement agreement must be approved by a federal judge. Representatives for Arizona's attorney general and the state Department of Corrections could not be reached to comment. Baich said the agreement, if approved, would mark the first time a U.S. state had agreed to such major changes in its drug protocol and execution procedures because of prisoners' complaints.  The state is taking appropriate steps to decrease the risk that prisoners will be tortured to death,  he said. Under the settlement, Arizona agreed not to use paralytic drugs, which lawyers for the inmates argued hid signs of consciousness and suffering during executions. The state also agreed to limit the authority of the director of the department of corrections to change execution drugs, and allow a prisoner time to challenge any drug changes, Baich said. States have been scrambling to find chemicals for lethal injection mixes after U.S. and European pharmaceutical makers placed a sales ban in recent years on drugs for executions because of ethical concerns. In December, Arizona agreed in the same case to stop using the valium-like sedative midazolam, or related products, as a part of a drug protocol for lethal injections. Midazolam has been used in troubled executions in Arizona, Alabama, Ohio and Oklahoma. In some instances, witnesses said convicted murderers twisted on gurneys before dying. It was also used along with a narcotic in Arizona's last execution, which was for convicted murderer Joseph Wood in 2014. Wood was seen gasping for air during a nearly two-hour procedure where he received 15 rounds of drug injections. Lethal injections typically result in death in a matter of minutes. Arizona also agreed under the settlement to allow greater transparency by letting witnesses view more of the execution process, including the moment the executioner administers the drugs intravenously, Baich said.

The changes are part of a settlement announced on Monday in federal court in Phoenix in a 2014 lawsuit brought by seven death row inmates who argued Arizona's lethal injection practices were experimental, secretive and caused inmates prolonged suffering. Dale Baich, a lawyer for the litigants in the case, said the settlement agreement must be approved by a federal judge. Representatives for Arizona's attorney general and the state Department of Corrections could not be reached to comment. Baich said the agreement, if approved, would mark the first time a U.S. state had agreed to such major changes in its drug protocol and execution procedures because of prisoners' complaints.   The state is taking appropriate steps to decrease the risk that prisoners will be tortured to death,  he said. Under the settlement, Arizona agreed not to use paralytic drugs, which lawyers for the inmates argued hid signs of consciousness and suffering during executions.  The state also agreed to limit the authority of the director of the department of corrections to change execution drugs, and allow a prisoner time to challenge any drug changes, Baich said. States have been scrambling to find chemicals for lethal injection mixes after U.S. and European pharmaceutical makers placed a sales ban in recent years on drugs for executions because of ethical concerns.  In December, Arizona agreed in the same case to stop using the valium-like sedative midazolam, or related products, as a part of a drug protocol for lethal injections.  Midazolam has been used in troubled executions in Arizona, Alabama, Ohio and Oklahoma. In some instances, witnesses said convicted murderers twisted on gurneys before dying. It was also used along with a narcotic in Arizona's last execution, which was for convicted murderer Joseph Wood in 2014.  Wood was seen gasping for air during a nearly two-hour procedure where he received 15 rounds of drug injections. Lethal injections typically result in death in a matter of minutes.  Arizona also agreed under the settlement to allow greater transparency by letting witnesses view more of the execution process, including the moment the executioner administers the drugs intravenously, Baich said.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  used narrow grounds to reject the Trump administration's bid to undo a Hawaii federal judge's decision blocking the temporary ban. It said the Republican president's March 6 order violated existing immigration law. But the three-judge panel - all Democratic appointees - did not address whether it was unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims. A second court, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld a Maryland judge's ruling that also blocked Trump's 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  The 4th Circuit had ruled that the ban, which replaced an earlier Jan. 27 one also blocked by the courts,  drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination  aimed at Muslims. The 9th Circuit largely left in place a nationwide injunction by Judge Derrick Watson that stopped parts of the order, which Trump said was urgently needed to prevent terrorism in the United States. That ruling came in a lawsuit challenging the order brought by the state of Hawaii, which stated the ban would harm its universities and tourism industry. Even before Monday's ruling, the case was on the fast track to the Supreme Court, where the administration on June 1 filed an emergency request seeking to reinstate the order and hear its appeal of the 4th Circuit ruling. The Supreme Court could act on the administration's request as soon as this week. Trump has been on the losing side in all four court rulings on the March order. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration is reviewing Monday's decision and expressed continued confidence that the order is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the Supreme Court.  I think we can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence,  Spicer told a briefing. The 9th Circuit upheld the block on Trump's three-month travel ban for the six countries and four-month suspension of all refugee admissions. But the court pared back part of Watson's injunction in order to allow the government to conduct internal reviews on vetting procedures for these travelers. The administration said the travel ban was needed to allow time to implement stronger vetting measures, although it has already rolled out some new requirements not blocked by courts, including additional questions for visa applicants. Rather than focusing on Trump campaign statements as the Virginia-based court did, the 9th Circuit said the language in the executive order itself did not make a rational case for why a travel ban was needed. FILE PHOTO - International travelers arrive at Logan airport following U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order travel ban in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. February 3, 2017.Brian Snyder The order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality,  the court wrote, referring the combined populations of the six countries.  'Attractive Way' Under immigration law, the administration was required to make findings that entry of the people in question would be detrimental to the United States but failed to do so, the court said. Stephen Vladeck, a professor at University of Texas School of Law, said the 9th Circuit provided an easier path for the Supreme Court to keep the travel ban on hold, because it avoided entirely the controversy over Trump's campaign statements.   It provides a very attractive way to leave the injunction in place without setting broader doctrinal rules about which they may have pause,  Vladeck said. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  Monday was the deadline for the ban's challengers to respond to the administration's request that the order be allowed to go into effect. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents people challenging the ban in the separate Maryland suit handled by the 4th Circuit, filed court papers urging the court not to take up the case, saying the order will become moot on Wednesday, 90 days from when Trump issued it. Lawyers for Hawaii called the order a  thinly veiled Muslim ban.  Trump's earlier Jan. 27 order also included Iraq among the countries targeted and a total ban on refugees from Syria. The March order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but was blocked before it could go into effect on March 16. The suits by Hawaii and the Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution's First Amendment that prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. Hawaii's court papers mentioned a series of Trump Twitter posts on June 5. Trump described the order as a  watered down, politically correct  version of his original one.

Qatar has sent a letter to the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) governing council in an effort to resolve the dispute after Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain closed their airspace to Qatari flights.  The Gulf state has indicated that it will ask the council to resolve the conflict, one of the sources said, using a dispute resolution mechanism under the 1944 Chicago Convention which is overseen by ICAO. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because council business is discussed in private. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar a week ago, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. The biggest diplomatic rift in years among the rich states of the Gulf has disrupted Qatar's imports of food and other materials, although its finance minister has played down the economic toll of the confrontation. [nL8N1J92G2] It is not yet clear whether the ICAO council, which is holding regularly scheduled meetings in Montreal this week, would agree to intervene, and how long any efforts would take. The matter is expected to be discussed at council by Friday, said one of the sources.   I would not expect any overnight resolutions,  he said. ICAO spokesman William Raillant-Clark said the agency could not make an immediate comment.   The UN aviation agency, which is headquartered in Montreal, does not impose binding rules, but wields clout through safety and security standards that are usually followed by its 191-member countries.

The office also said it was turning to the Supreme Court a request by two opposition lawmakers that President Jimmy Morales be investigated for his role in the tragedy, for having placed unqualified officials into the state body that ran the shelter.  If the court accepts the lawmakers' petition and believes there is enough evidence for a case against Morales, it would turn the petition to Guatemala's Congress, where lawmakers would decide whether or not to remove Morales' immunity from investigation and proceed with a probe against him. The arrests form part of the investigation into the March blaze, which became a major scandal in Guatemala, especially after it emerged that the girls had been locked in a classroom after an escape attempt. The girls set mattresses on fire to try to call someone's attention.  The fire broke out in a wing of the government-run Virgen de la Asuncion home near San Jose Pinula, southwest of Guatemala City, which housed abused girls, as well as boys. Three of the five people arrested were charged with manslaughter and abuse of minors. The other two were not charged with manslaughter, but face accusations of abuse, the attorney general's office said.  Sandra Moran and Leocadio Juracan, the two leftist lawmakers from the Convergencia party who filed the case against the president, accuse Morales of having the ultimate responsibility in the tragedy for his role in staffing the social services ministry that ran the shelter.  We presented a criminal complaint against the president on March 14 for four crimes: abuse of authority, torture, non-compliance of duty and murder,  Moran said by phone.  Morales' spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government called a press conference for later on Monday to talk about the situation.

Gibson,US,USA,TRADE,NAFTA,STEEL,Americas,Steel,Japan,South America / Central America,International Trade,China (PRC),Mexico,Government / Politics,Economic Events,Asia / Pacific,Canada,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. steelmakers' association on Monday called for better coordination and enforcement of rules under a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement to guard against Mexico, the United States and Canada becoming a dumping ground for cheap steel from other countries. In comments to the U.S. Trade Representative ahead of NAFTA negotiations in August, the head of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), Thomas Gibson, urged updates to NAFTA's rules of origin - how much of a product is made in North American - new measures to curb steel dumped on the market by non-NAFTA countries, and steps to improve customs procedures.  The American steel industry views NAFTA as a successful agreement but after 23 years, one that can also be modernized and strengthened,  Gibson said in a letter to Edward Gresser, chairman of USTR's Trade Policy Staff Committee. The U.S. Trade Representative office asked businesses and industry groups to submit recommendations this week ahead of the NAFTA talks. AISI members include ArcelorMittal USA, Nucor Corp  (NUE.N), U.S. Steel and AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS.N). Gibson also said  enforceable currency disciplines  should be added to the new NAFTA to avoid trade-distorting currency misalignments or competitive currency depreciation, a complaint often heard by U.S. manufacturers against such countries as China and Japan. He said while Mexico and Canada did not manipulate their currencies, a currency clause would be a useful precedent for other trade agreements where it might be more relevant. NAFTA should also help level the playing field for North American steel producers, which are disadvantaged by enterprises that are owned or financed by governments, Gibson added. After calling NAFTA  the worst trade deal  ever during the presidential election campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump has since softened his stance toward the agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Instead of dismantling NAFTA, most U.S. industries and businesses have called for it to be updated and modernized. Like U.S. automakers, the U.S. steel industry has expressed concerns that changes could interfere with existing supply networks. In other comments sent to USTR ahead of the NAFTA talks, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called on the Trump administration to ensure that the negotiations  be conducted in a manner that does not put millions of American jobs at risk.    The chamber supports this effort to modernize the NAFTA, taking into account technological, economic, and other changes in the U.S., North American, and global economies in recent years,  the chamber's senior vice president for international policy, John Murphy, said. Meanwhile, the National Foreign Trade Council said the talks should create more open markets and better rules, not new restrictions.

Investment to conserve natural habitats also makes sense for insurers, a report written for Lloyd's said on Tuesday, as it is around 30 times cheaper than building seawalls. Insurers have paid out more than $200 billion in claims for damages due to coastal floods in the past 10 years.  But they could reduce the amount they pay in claims and offer lower premiums if they considered the impact of natural infrastructure.   If you are in a more resilient city, compared to a less resilient one, then those risk levels should be taken into account in pricing,  said Trevor Maynard, head of innovation at Lloyd's. Insurers should invest more in habitat conservation to reduce the risks from coastal floods, the report, by the Center for the Blue Economy, the University of California, Santa Cruz and The Nature Conservancy, said.  Flood risk reduction should be undertaken before the flood occurs, but we currently spend much more on recovery efforts than on risk reduction.   Coastal wetlands remaining in the northeast of the United States saved more than $625 million in flood damages from Hurricane Sandy, around 1 percent of the total flood damages from the 2012 hurricane, previous research for Lloyd's has shown. Public and private sector financing to support natural infrastructure is increasing, but  the availability is geographically uneven,  the report said.

The nonprofit theater said it recognized that its contemporary staging of the play, which portrays Caesar as a magnetic, blond businessman with a gold bathtub, had provoked heated debate. Actors and other artists threatened on Monday to boycott the two companies that ended their sponsorship.  Such discussion is exactly the goal of our civically-engaged theater,  it said in a statement.  Our production of Julius Caesar in no way advocates violence towards anyone. Shakespeare's play, and our production, make the opposite point: those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save,  the theater said.     Delta and Bank of America ended their support of the production on Sunday, hours after Trump's son Donald Jr.  questioned in a tweet whether it was art or political speech.  Disappointed in @Delta for turning its back on free expression. I've flown many thousands of miles with you. No more,  tweeted Beau Willimon, an American playwright and creator of the popular Netflix series  House of Cards.  Novelist Joyce Carol Oates tweeted that she would see the play  in thrilled defiance of ignorant would-be censors.  Actor Ron Perlman, known for his big-screen depiction of  Hellboy,  also condemned the two former sponsors.  Act accordingly,  Perlman told his followers on Twitter. 'Crossed the Line' On Sunday, Delta Air Lines said it pulled its support because the production  crossed the line on the standards of good taste,  while Bank of America said the play was presented in a manner intended to provoke and offend.  Had this intention been made known to us, we would have decided not to sponsor it,  the bank's statement said. The two companies also received support on social media.  Kudos to @Delta for pulling $$ from 'play' portraying assassination of @POTUS,  former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, a Republican whose daughter is deputy White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter.  No one should sponsor crap like that!  The National Endowment for the Arts said in a statement that while it had given the New York Shakespeare Festival $320,000 over the past four years, no NEA funds were awarded to support the Public Theater's production of  Julius Caesar.   American Express Co (AXP.N), which calls itself  the official card of The Public Theater,  said on Monday it did not support this version of  Julius Caesar,  but did not say if it would drop funding.  The Public Theater puts on many shows. Our sponsorship does not go toward the funding of the production of Shakespeare in the Park and we do not condone thisÂ interpretation of the play,  American Express said in a statement. Comedian Kathy Griffin faced a backlash in recent weeks after posing for a photograph with a fake severed and bloodied head resembling Trump.  After images were published on social media, Griffin lost sponsorships and jobs, including co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.

The Socialists looked set to win as few as 30 seats in the 577 French national assembly after this weekend's first-round vote, but Moscovici said his party's travails mirrored those of Social Democrats across Europe.  My conviction is that the Socialist Party in France is not fit for survival in its current form, but there is space for a new one,  he told the newspapers.

Twenty years after Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule, these young, alternative conservationists are eager to document the city's remaining historical buildings. Some structures have been demolished over the decades to make room for development in one of the world's most expensive real estate markets. Protests in 2007 against the tearing down of Victoria Harbour's Queen's Pier, which for almost half a century marked the ceremonial arrivals of British governors and royals including Queen Elizabeth, is often cited as a starting point for street activism bent on preserving Hong Kong's culture. For the young explorers in the group HK URBEX what started out as a hobby in 2013 has blossomed into a mission to assemble an archive of the city's colonial-era architecture. The eight members spend weeks and even months researching derelict sites before visiting and documenting them through photos and film that are posted on their social media page. They have recorded more than 50 sites in Hong Kong alone. Short videos show the members shining their flashlights on the prison gates of a colonial political prison, a pile of dusty movie reels and posters in an empty movie studio, or the walls of a former World War Two air raid tunnel.  I just fear that in maybe 20 years time, there won't be a lot of unique Hong Kong heritage or architecture that really shows that we are Hong Kong, because there's no other place like us,  said one of the group's co-founders, who declined to be identified because his activities could involve illegal trespassing.  And the government, of course, should be more active in preserving these places because in a way, it's also preserving our Hong Kong identity.  Currently 114 buildings and cultural landmarks are protected from development and more than 1,000 buildings are assigned a historic grade by the governmentâs Antiquities and Monuments Office. The Commissioner for Heritage's Office said in a written response to Reuters that the government had launched the revitalization of 19 historic buildings since it first announced its policies on heritage conservation a decade ago.  Conservation of historic buildings in Hong Kong has gone some way to the point which requires efforts beyond the government,  it added.

Training flights at Arizona's Luke Air Force Base, where the 55 jets are based, were canceled on Friday and scheduled to resume on Monday, but the grounding was extended indefinitely. More than 220 F-35s are flying worldwide. The grounding comes at a critical time for Lockheed, which plans to demonstrate the advanced jet at the Paris Air Show next week. F-35 air operations at other bases continued, U.S. Air Force officials said. The F-35 business accounts for about 37 percent of Lockheed's total revenue. During the first quarter, Lockheed's revenue from its aeronautics business increased 8 percent to $4.11 billion, led by higher sales of the F-35. Luke Air Force Base, located northwest of Phoenix, is home to the 56th Fighter Wing. The base canceled local flying operations for its F-35A Lightning II aircraft due to five incidents in which pilots experienced symptoms resembling hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, Graff said on Friday at the Pentagon. The Air Force said the incidents occurred from May 2 to Thursday, and that in each case the aircraft's backup oxygen system worked as designed and the jets were able to land safely. The base's F-35A Lightning II's typically fly 25 training missions each weekday, base officials said. The halt in flights at Luke Air Force Base was extended so the Air Force could study the issue with pilots, maintenance workers and medical professionals, said Major Rebecca Heyse, a base spokeswoman. Luke is the largest F-35 base in the world and trains U.S. pilots as well as those of allied countries.  A Lockheed representative said the company would help the Air Force address the issue. Lockheed and its main partners, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), United Technologies Corp's (UTX.N) Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L), have been developing and building F-35s for the U.S. military and 10 allies. The 220 F-35s around the world have collectively flown more than 95,000 flight hours, though the plane has not yet seen combat.

(Reuters) - Defense attorney Brian McMonagle's arguably biggest courtroom drama, the sex assault trial of entertainer Bill Cosby, has been a legal rematch with prosecutor Kevin Steele, who was on the opposing - and losing - side of a nearly identical 2014 rape case. In the Cosby trial, McMonagle, 58, wielded his signature defense style, aggressive cross-examinations and a theatrical closing argument, to make his case while calling just one witness on Monday. A veteran of the Philadelphia legal scene, he made his name in the district attorney's office prosecuting high-profile murder cases before moving into private practice in the early 1990s. McMonagle, who went to Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, has won hundreds of acquittals defending mobsters, rappers and athletes. People familiar with McMonagle's past work said he was a natural choice to defend Cosby, 79, in state court in Norristown, Pennsylvania, a Philadelphia suburb. Christopher Hall, a former federal prosecutor in the Philadelphia, said McMonagle was well known for his skill at cross-examination.  It requires tremendous concentration and command of the facts, and the ability to synthesize that in real time,  Hall said.   There's also an element of affability. I call it emotional intelligence. Brian has that emotional intelligence.  For Steele, the Montgomery County district attorney, McMonagle's most rattling win may have been the 2014 rape case. The defense attorney secured the dismissal of aggravated indecent assault charges against a high-powered lawyer who was accused of drugging and raping a female employee. It is the same charge that Steele is asking a jury to find Cosby guilty of after the performer was accused of giving pills to Andrea Constand and sexually assaulting her in 2004. The 2014 case never went to trial after McMonagle succeeded in highlighting flaws in police evidence gathering, including a report that suggested the victim had been given a drugged glass of wine. McMonagle used a similar approach in Cosby's trial, hammering the credibility of expert witnesses while avoiding taking direct aim at the alleged victims. He opted to let female colleague Angela Agrusa cross-examine Constand and a witness, Kelly Johnson, who also said Cosby sexually assaulted her. His other high-profile successes include the defense of a Roman Catholic archbishop accused of covering up sex assault by clergy in Pennsylvania, a former deputy attorney general facing homicide charges and the acquittal of the city's deputy mayor in one of the largest U.S. federal corruption cases. McMonagle tends to play the jury dramatically, raising his voice in exasperation at testimony he does not believe and gesturing. In his closing argument on Monday, McMonagle asked jurors,  If I did anything or said anything that offended any of your number, hold it against me,  not Cosby.  Sometimes I wear emotions on my sleeve. That isn't always a good look for a lawyer.

Garcia ended nearly two decades of frustration with his playoff victory over England's Justin Rose at the Masters in April.  It was something incredible,  Rahm said about the long-awaited victory by Garcia, who as a 19-year-old challenged Tiger Woods over the closing holes before finishing runner-up at the 1999 PGA Championship.  He's been so close so many times.  Rahm said the setting and the timing were perfect for role model Garcia.  With all the places, and all the possible days he could have won, being Seve's (the late Ballesteros' 60th) birthday at Augusta, I don't think you would ever get much more special than that for him,  he told reporters on Monday after practising ahead of Thursday's first round of the U.S. Open.  To be able to see him succeed the way he did, I thought it was absolutely incredible. And finish the way he did. It was absolutely amazing.  Huge Moment Rahm said Garcia's thrilling victory touched him personally.  He's always been one of my idols, one of the people I looked up to,  he said.  And as a Spaniard it was something amazing. I can't tell you how happy Spain was. It was a huge moment.  Rahm, 22, said Garcia's triumph fueled his own quest for a first major title. A win by Rahm at Erin Hills would extend a run of six straight first-time major winners following Garcia, Jimmy Walker (2016 PGA), Henrik Stenson (2016 British Open), Dustin Johnson (2016 U.S. Open), Danny Willett (2016 Masters) and Jason Day (2015 PGA).    It just motivates me,  said the stocky, powerful Spaniard, who ranks as a long driver despite taking one of the shortest backswings on the tour.  We've played together a bunch this year,  Rahm said.  I see what he can do. And I know what I'm capable of. It makes me believe that I do think I'll be able to win a major some day. And it makes me want to work harder.  A close friend of mine winning a tournament motivates me. A Spaniard winning a major is always going to motivate me.

Eddie Tipton faces 13-1/2 years in prison and a fine of $35,000 for theft by fraud and computer crime, both felonies, for programming lottery software resulting in him winning nearly $800,000, Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said in a statement. Tipton, who pleaded guilty in Dane County, Wisconsin, will be sentenced on Sept. 21. Tipton's attorney could not be reached for comment after business hours on Monday. As part of the agreement, Tipton will also plead guilty to one count of ongoing criminal conduct in Iowa at a later date and pay restitution to Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma for similar fraudulent lottery wins.  Mr. Tipton's actions defrauding the lottery were a gross violation of the public's trust and confidence and I'm grateful to the coalition of state entities and law enforcement agencies that spanned multiple states for their efforts to find truth and seek justice,  Schimel said. Tipton worked for the Multi-State Lottery Association and was responsible for programming the software used in the random number generator machines that picked the winning numbers, Schimel said. In 2007, Tipton programmed a modified code in the random number generator software that, when certain conditions were met, produced a predictable set of winning numbers. He then supplied these numbers to his friend, Robert Rhodes, who purchased a winning Megabucks ticket worth $783,257 on Dec. 29, 2007. Rhodes and Tipton split the proceeds. Tipton was previously convicted by a jury in Iowa in 2015 for two counts of fraud for rigging the Hot Lotto drawing in that state to win a $14.3 million prize.

Greg Gianforte, a wealthy former technology executive who campaigned on his support for President Donald Trump, attacked a reporter on May 24, the day before he won a special election to fill Montana's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Gallatin County Judge Rick West sentenced Gianforte to 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management classes. The judge in Bozeman, Montana, also handed down a six-month deferred jail sentence, allowing Gianforte to avoid time behind bars if he complies with the court's orders.

Timothy Sedlak, 44, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams in Manhattan to 18 months to run concurrently, rather than on top of, a sentence handed down last August based on child pornography being discovered on his computers during the hacking investigation. Prosecutors said that from June 2015 to July 2015, Sedlak from his residence in Florida made nearly 400,000 unsuccessful attempts to gain unauthorized access to the computer network of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The investigation into Sedlak, of Ocoee, Florida, predated probes into cyber attacks on the Democratic Party in the 2016 presidential election when Hillary Clinton was the party's nominee. U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered cyber attacks to help then-Republican candidate Donald Trump's chances of becoming president. Prosecutors in arguing in court papers that Sedlak deserved up to two years more in prison called the impact of cyber threats  profound.   The work of hackers like Sedlak who are motivated to target U.S. government officials and political candidates can have severe consequences of undermining public confidence and trust in our government institutions and political system,  they wrote. In September 2015, federal agents executed a search warrant on Sedlak's home and discovered 42 computers, many of which were running a password-cracking program, prosecutors said. According to court papers, the U.S. Secret Service questioned Sedlak about notes agents found referring to Hillary Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea. Sedlak, who called himself a private investigator, told the agents he was researching whether charities were unintentionally providing funding to Islamist militant groups, and said the Clintons  came up in his research,  court papers said. Chelsea Clinton is the vice chair of the foundation, which was started by her father, former U.S. President Bill Clinton.      Prosecutors said Sedlak also targeted charities, political organizations, investments firms, law firms and businesses. Following his arrest, authorities discovered files on his computers containing child pornography, including images depicting Sedlak sexually abusing a toddler, prosecutors said. Sedlak was separately charged in Florida, where a federal jury in Orlando in May 2016 found him guilty of charges he produced and possessed child pornography.

A federal jury in March found Barry Cadden, the co-founder and ex-president of New England Compounding Center, guilty on racketeering and fraud counts but cleared him of the most serious charges, second-degree murder, for his role in a meningitis outbreak that sickened 753 people in 20 states, killing 64. But when the 12 jurors filled out their verdict slip, rather than just checking findings of  guilty  or  not guilty,  they filled in numbers that prosecutors now say reflected vote counts showing a majority found Cadden guilty on 21 of 25 murder counts. The U.S. Attorney's office in Massachusetts argued in a motion filed on Monday that the verdict form showed jurors believed Cadden was guilty of murder and want the judge to consider that fact in determining his sentence on June 26. Former prosecutors said they had never seen a verdict slip quite like it.  While they failed to reach unanimity on these racketeering acts, the jury's verdict confirmed that the murder racketeering acts were proven by a preponderance of the evidence in this case, and can be properly considered at sentencing,  prosecutors wrote in the filing. Their argument might work since judges at sentencing can consider conduct proven by a standard lower than what jurors are instructed to follow to convict someone, said David Schumacher, former deputy chief of the health care fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney's office.  They have a very good argument,  he said.  They actually have documentary evidence prosecutors never have in criminal cases.

Sessions will likely face tough questions at the open Senate Intelligence Committee hearing over his dealings with Russian officials during the campaign and whether he had a role in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Until a statement on Monday from committee Chairman Richard Burr, a Republican, it had been unclear whether Sessions would testify in an open or closed setting. Initially, Sessions expected to testify in a closed-door session, said two sources familiar with the attorney general's thinking. But he left the decision up to Burr, the sources said. A Justice Department spokeswoman said that Sessions requested the open setting because  he believes it is important for the American people to hear the truth directly from him.  Comey told the same panel last week that the FBI had information in mid-February on Sessions that would have made it  problematic  for the attorney general to continue leading a federal probe into Russian attempts to influence the presidential election. Sessions recused himself from that inquiry in March after media reports that he had been in two previously undisclosed meetings last year with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Tuesday's testimony, scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT), will be the first for Sessions in a congressional hearing since he became attorney general. During his nomination hearing in January, the former senator told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had no contacts with Russian officials as part of the Trump campaign. Sessions is likely to be questioned over the truthfulness of his answers in January. A spokesman for the Justice Department said after media reports emerged in March of the meetings that Sessions had answered honestly because the encounters were part of his job as a senator and not as a surrogate of the Trump campaign. Most Senior Official to Testify Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of both the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees, has said Sessions should answer questions about his January testimony. Intelligence Committee members will also likely ask Sessions about a possible third undisclosed meeting with Kislyak that is now under investigation, according to media reports. Sessions, an early supporter of Trump's election campaign, will be the most senior government official to testify to the committee on the Russia issue, which has dogged the Republican president's early months in office. Critics charged that by firing Comey on May 9, Trump was trying to hinder the FBI's Russia probe. The former FBI chief added fuel to that accusation with his testimony last week. Trump has denied he tried to interfere with the probe. In his testimony, Comey said he had asked Sessions not to leave him alone with Trump following meetings where he said Trump had asked Comey for his loyalty. The attorney general may also face questions on that. Media reports last week said Sessions offered to resign because of tensions with Trump over his decision to recuse himself from the FBI's Russia probe. The allegations are being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller and several congressional panels, including the Senate Intelligence Committee. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow.

McMahon and others at National Securities Corporation, for instance, bought or sold between 200 and 900 shares of Apple stock for Haus nine times in about a year - racking up $27,000 in fees, according to a 2015 complaint Haus filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Haus alerted the regulator to what he called improper âchurningâ of his account to harvest excessive fees. But the allegation could hardly have come as a surprise to FINRA, the industryâs self-regulating body, which is charged by Congress with protecting investors from unscrupulous brokers. FINRA has fined National at least 25 times since 2000. As of earlier this year,  35 percent of Nationalâs 714 brokers had a history of regulatory run-ins, legal disputes or personal financial difficulties that FINRA requires brokers to disclose to investors, according to a Reuters analysis of FINRA data. McMahon did not respond to requests for comment. National declined to comment. National is among 48 firms where at least 30 percent of brokers have such FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis, which examined only the 12 most serious incidents among the 23 that FINRA requires brokers to disclose. That compares to 9 percent of brokers industry-wide who have at least one of those 12 FINRA flags on their record. In total, the 48 firms oversee about 4,600 brokers and billions of dollars in investor funds. For a graphic with the complete list of firms and statistics on each, see: tmsnrt.rs/2rtbhOl FINRA officials acknowledged in interviews with Reuters that the longstanding hiring practices at certain firms are a threat to investors. But they also argued that they can do little to stop firms from hiring high concentrations of potentially problematic brokers because doing so is not illegal. That leaves investors like Haus vulnerable to a small group of brokerages that regularly hire advisors with blemishes on their backgrounds that would make them unemployable at most firms, former regulators and industry experts said. The dozen FINRA flags examined by Reuters include regulatory sanctions for misconduct, employment terminations after allegations of misconduct and payments by firms to settle customer complaints. They also include brokersâ personal financial troubles, such as bankruptcies or liens for nonpayment of debts. [L1N1J9032] (For full coverage, including an explanation of Reuters methodology, see: here )  Last year, a FINRA official told Reuters, the regulator identified 90 firms as posing the highest risk to investors and flagged them internally for higher scrutiny. But FINRA declined to name the firms publicly or to release statistics showing the concentration of brokers with a history of FINRA flags within each firm. In an interview with Reuters, FINRAâs executive vice president of regulatory operations, Susan Axelrod, declined to comment on any specific firm identified by Reuters. She would not directly address why the regulator will not publicly name the firms it identified as high-risk. âLetâs just say those are not new names to us,â she said of the firms identified by Reuters. FINRA Chief Executive Robert Cook, however, addressed its unwillingness to name names in a speech on Monday morning in Washington at Georgetown University, according to prepared remarks released by FINRA. âWe must consider fairness and due process,â Cook said. âFINRA does not possess a crystal ball - someone who we may identify as a high-risk broker for oversight purposes is not necessarily a bad actor.â The regulator has created a dedicated unit focused on those high-risk firms, Axelrod told Reuters, but she declined to discuss its budget, staffing or specific duties. Cook on Monday said the unit included an unstated number of âexaminers and managersâ with experience dealing with high-risk brokers. FINRA makes data on individual brokersâ backgrounds available through its Brokercheck website, which Axelrod said provides âunparalleled transparencyâ to investors. That site allows the public to search histories of complaints and sanctions against individual brokers â but only one at a time. The regulator will not release the data in bulk form, such as a database, that would enable researchers to identify firms with high concentrations of brokers with a history of FINRA flags. Reuters analyzed the FINRA data after receiving it from researchers at Columbia University Law School DataLab, who wrote computer code to extract it from the regulatorâs website. Reuters sought comment from officials at all 48 firms. Some responded that many of the FINRA-mandated disclosures do not necessarily equate to misconduct by brokers, such as when a firm pays a client to settle a complaint without admitting wrongdoing. Cook, the FINRA chief, echoed that point in his speech Monday. âA broker who has an unpaid lien because of a debt accrued due to a medical issue in her family must disclose that lien,â he said. âThat event should not be treated the same as fraud or stealing money from customers.â At least one executive from a firm identified in the Reuters analysis serves on FINRAâs 24-member Board of Governors - Brian Kovack, president of Fort Lauderdale-based Kovack Securities Inc. Thirty-four percent of the firmâs 388 brokers have a history of FINRA flags, according to the Reuters analysis. In a statement, Brian Kovack attributed those figures to the firmâs decision to take on a large number of new brokers from another brokerage in 2014, which prevented the firm from using its usual vetting process for new employees. Asked why, three years later, the firm still has a high concentration of brokers with FINRA flags, Kovack said it took âconsiderableâ time to ensure the review of new brokersâ backgrounds was âfair and transparent.â  After the review, the firm asked some advisors to leave, Kovack said, without specifying how many or the reasons they were dismissed. Self-Regulation FINRA is not a government agency, but rather an industry-financed âself-regulatory organizationâ - as FINRA puts it - that is not subject to public records laws and receives no taxpayer support. Its annual operating budget of about $1 billion - supporting about 3,500 staffers in 16 offices - comes primarily from dues paid by member firms and individual brokers. FINRA has the power to fine, suspend and ban firms and brokers, and it can refer potentially criminal cases to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Last year, in an unlikely collaboration, Senators Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, sent FINRA a letter demanding the regulator do more to stop broker misconduct and to prevent those with troubled histories from concentrating in the same firms. Related CoverageHow Reuters analyzed the data FINRA doesn't want you to seeâFINRA is not doing nearly enough to fulfill its investor protection mission,â the letter read. The regulator responded with a letter on June 15 of last year saying that it closely oversees firms âto determine whether they present a heightened risk to investors.â From 2013 to mid-2016, the regulator told the senators, it identified 279 âhigh-riskâ brokers. After identifying them, the regulator permanently banned 238 brokers from the industry for subsequent violations. FINRA oversees about 3,800 brokerages and 630,000 brokers. In interviews with Reuters, Axelrod pointed to firms that FINRA expelled. The regulator shut down about 130 firms in the six years ending in January 2017, with many cited for securities fraud, misuse of funds or falsifying records. But the Reuters analysis of FINRA data found that the regulator did not expel the firmâs chief executive in 58 percent of those cases, leaving him or her free to join other brokerages. The brokers at those banned firms typically were also able to continue working in the industry. Axelrod said that FINRA gives extra scrutiny to former executives of expelled firms after they show up with new jobs at other firms. âOverwhelmingâ Evidence Regulators in at least one state think more can be done to crack down on brokers and brokerages with track records of violations. Massachusetts securities regulators are considering changing their licensing practices after completing a review last year of brokerages with a high proportion of brokers with troubled histories. âThe evidence is pretty overwhelming that there is a practice here - a history here - of people moving from one firm to another and re-offending,â Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin told Reuters. âWe canât simply stand by and say, âThe companies will do a better job.â They wonât do a better job unless they feel some incentive.â Some former regulators contacted by Reuters agreed with FINRAâs policy of withholding its internal risk ratings of firms from the public. Susan Merrill - former head of enforcement at FINRA and now a partner with the law firm Sidley Austin LLP - said that releasing such ratings would be unfair to firms who have not necessarily broken laws or regulations. âIf there is a finding by the regulator,â Merrill said, âthen thatâs fair game.â FINRAâs former CEO, Richard Ketchum, told Reuters last June that the regulator was considering publicly disclosing more information about firms with high concentrations of problematic brokers. FILE PHOTO - Robert Cook, the director of the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets, testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on the collapse of MF Global in Washington, DC, U.S. on April 24, 2012.Gary Cameron/File PhotoâWe are looking hard at questions about how we can appropriately and fairly provide that broader disclosure ... when firms have concentrations of persons that have similar problems,â Ketchum said in an interview. Cook said Monday that FINRA was considering additional measures to rein in high-risk brokers, but he didnât go into specifics. Wolves of Wall Street Many of the 48 firms identified by Reuters regularly cold-call customers on the phone with high-pressure sales pitches, according to regulatory complaints and sanctions against the firms and their brokers. Long Island, New York, has historically been a haven for boiler-room brokerages, which inspired the movie, âThe Wolf of Wall Street,â based on the true story of broker Jordan Belfort and his firm, Stratton Oakmont. Belfort pleaded guilty to securities fraud and money laundering in 1999. FINRA warned in a news release last year that boiler-room tactics were on the rise, particularly those targeting the elderly and other vulnerable investors. Brokers generally know which firms will hire them despite past sanctions, said Dean Jeske, a lawyer at Foley & Lardner and FINRAâs former deputy regional chief counsel for enforcement in the Midwest. âWhen you get a mark on your (record), itâs hard to get a job at Morgan Stanley or Merrill Lynch,â Jeske said. Mike McMahon has had little trouble landing jobs at brokerages despite a trail of allegations and settlements. McMahon left National in 2014 and later joined a smaller firm, Long Island-based Worden Capital Management - where 43 percent of 79 brokers had a history of FINRA flags as of earlier this year. Forty-one percent of the firmâs brokers had at some point in their careers worked at firms that were later expelled by FINRA, according to the Reuters analysis. Jamie Worden, head of Worden Capital, said in a statement that his firmâs compliance team vets all prospective brokers and that FINRA-mandated disclosures do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. âThe public disclosures only represent a sliver of the information surrounding any circumstance,â Worden said. McMahon, National and another firm where he worked have agreed to pay a total of $1.35 million since 2007 to settle 10 separate client complaints involving McMahon, according to McMahonâs record on FINRAâs BrokerCheck website. In addition, McMahon currently faces four additional complaints to FINRA - which have yet to be resolved in a settlement or arbitration ruling - from clients he advised while working with National, the regulatorâs records show. McMahon denied any wrongdoing in several of the settled complaints. Slideshow (5 Images)Haus - the customer who lost more than half a million dollars with McMahon and others at National - told Reuters that the ordeal made him contemplate suicide. âI was ashamed,â said the soybean farmer and U.S. military veteran. âI didnât want to tell anyone Iâm losing my life savings.â Haus settled his complaint against National in November for an undisclosed amount of money. The settlement required him to sign a nondisclosure agreement, and he has since not responded to Reutersâ inquiries. Hiring Opportunity In many cases, the firms identified by Reuters continue to operate after years of repeated run-ins with FINRA and other regulators. Take Los Angeles-based WestPark Capital Inc, where about half of the firmâs 95 brokers have FINRA flags on their records. More than 47 percent of WestPark brokers once worked at firms that were later expelled by FINRA. Regulators including FINRA and the New Jersey Bureau of Securities have sanctioned WestPark six times in the past 11 years for a variety of alleged violations. In 2004, FINRA suspended WestParkâs chief executive, Richard Rappaport, for 30 days from his management role and fined him and the firm $50,000 in response to allegations that WestPark omitted critical information from investment research reports and lacked supervisory controls.  Without admitting wrongdoing, Rappaport agreed to the punishment in a settlement with FINRA. But he then ignored the suspension and continued to actively manage WestPark, according to FINRA disciplinary records reviewed by Reuters. His punishment for ignoring the 30-day suspension? Another 30-day suspension from FINRA and a $10,000 fine. In 2016, West Park saw a hiring opportunity. The firm started taking on dozens of brokers from Newport Coast Securities - a firm that FINRA banned from the industry that year for excessive trading in client accounts to rack up fees and for recommending unsuitable investments. Newport appealed the expulsion. By early 2017, WestPark had hired about 40 brokers from Newport Coast - including its former CEO, Richard Onesto. WestPark and Rappaport declined to comment. Onesto did not respond to requests for comment. Pump and Dump Another firm Reuters identified in its analysis - Windsor Street Capital - has been fined 12 times by FINRA since 2000 but may now face much stiffer penalties from the SEC. Fifty-eight percent of the firmâs 48 brokers had FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis. Over the years, FINRA fines have cost the firm about $300,000, and Windsor has appealed two other fines totaling more than $1 million. In January, the SEC brought administrative actions against Windsor Street Capital and its former anti-money laundering officer, John Telfer, for allegedly facilitating a $25 million pump-and-dump scheme - in which investors promote or âpumpâ the value of a dubious stock they own just before selling, or âdumpingâ it. Windsor declined to comment to Reuters but denied any misconduct in an SEC filing. The SEC alleges that Windsor allowed clients to sell hundreds of millions of unregistered penny stocks through Windsor brokerage accounts and did not report the suspicious transactions to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Windsor clients bought stock in dormant shell companies, spread false information to promote the companiesâ products and then dumped the shares as other investors bought in at inflated prices, the SEC alleges in a case that is still pending. Windsor made about $500,000 in commissions and fees from transactions related to the scheme, according to the SEC. When asked if FINRA investigators contributed to the SECâs investigation, an SEC official declined to comment and pointed to the agencyâs press release, which only credits SEC investigators. FINRA did not respond to requests for comment on whether it had a role in the Windsor investigation. âHappy New Year!â At Long Island-based Joseph Stone Capital, 71 percent of the firmsâ 59 brokers had FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis. Joseph Stone was investigated by the state of Montana after one of its sales representatives, Lawrence Sullivan, cold-called the office of Montanaâs Commissioner of Securities and Insurance to pitch an investment on January 15, 2016, according to a report on the incident by the regulator. The securities commission launched an investigation into the firm after the call, during which Sullivan quickly backtracked and denied he was pitching securities, according to the report. Reuters could not reach Sullivan for comment. The staffer he called - Patrick Navarro, an assistant analyst at the state regulator - did not respond to requests for comment. Investigators ultimately unearthed âfraudulent and unethicalâ practices, including excessive trading in client accounts - resulting in commissions totaling 28 percent of the $877,493 invested by clients in Montana, according to the regulatorâs report. The firm settled with the state on April 18, agreeing to pay $30,000 in restitution to clients without admitting wrongdoing. During the call that got the firm into trouble, Sullivan pitched Navarro on an investment in Paypal stock, the report said. After Navarro informed Sullivan that he worked for the stateâs securities regulator, Sullivan blurted out âHappy New Year!â and hung up.

A preliminary settlement was filed on Monday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, and requires a judge's approval. It follows similar settlements with Barclays Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc for a respective $94 million and $45 million, which have won preliminary court approval. Euribor is the euro-denominated equivalent of Libor, a benchmark for setting rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of credit cards, student loans, mortgages and other debt. Investors accused banks of conspiring to rig Euribor and fix prices of Euribor-based derivatives from June 2005 to March 2011 to profit at their expense, in violation of U.S. antitrust law. Deutsche Bank did not admit wrongdoing and settled to avoid the cost and distraction of more litigation, court papers show. The German bank's legal bills have topped 15 billion euros ($16.8 billion) since 2009. A spokesman, Troy Gravitt, declined to comment. Vincent Briganti, a lawyer for the investors, also declined to comment. The case against Deutsche Bank had been put on hold in January, pending the submission of settlement papers. Among the plaintiffs were the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), and Greenwich, Connecticut-based FrontPoint Australian Opportunities Trust. In February, U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan, who oversees the litigation, dismissed most of the investors' claims against several other banks. In April, he refused to let the investors amend their lawsuit for a fifth time. Regulators have imposed more than $4 billion in penalties against various banks for alleged manipulation, Castel has said. Many lawsuits in the Manhattan court seek to hold banks liable for alleged rigging in interest rate, commodity, currency and other financial markets. The case is Sullivan et al v.

McMahon and others at National Securities Corporation, for instance, bought or sold between 200 and 900 shares of Apple stock for Haus nine times in about a year - racking up $27,000 in fees, according to a 2015 complaint Haus filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Haus alerted the regulator to what he called improper âchurningâ of his account to harvest excessive fees. But the allegation could hardly have come as a surprise to FINRA, the industryâs self-regulating body, which is charged by Congress with protecting investors from unscrupulous brokers. FINRA has fined National at least 25 times since 2000. As of earlier this year,  35 percent of Nationalâs 714 brokers had a history of regulatory run-ins, legal disputes or personal financial difficulties that FINRA requires brokers to disclose to investors, according to a Reuters analysis of FINRA data. McMahon did not respond to requests for comment. National declined to comment. National is among 48 firms where at least 30 percent of brokers have such FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis, which examined only the 12 most serious incidents among the 23 that FINRA requires brokers to disclose. That compares to 9 percent of brokers industry-wide who have at least one of those 12 FINRA flags on their record. In total, the 48 firms oversee about 4,600 brokers and billions of dollars in investor funds. For a graphic with the complete list of firms and statistics on each, see: tmsnrt.rs/2rtbhOl FINRA officials acknowledged in interviews with Reuters that the longstanding hiring practices at certain firms are a threat to investors. But they also argued that they can do little to stop firms from hiring high concentrations of potentially problematic brokers because doing so is not illegal. That leaves investors like Haus vulnerable to a small group of brokerages that regularly hire advisors with blemishes on their backgrounds that would make them unemployable at most firms, former regulators and industry experts said.

Pump and Dump Another firm Reuters identified in its analysis - Windsor Street Capital - has been fined 12 times by FINRA since 2000 but may now face much stiffer penalties from the SEC. Fifty-eight percent of the firmâs 48 brokers had FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis. Over the years, FINRA fines have cost the firm about $300,000, and Windsor has appealed two other fines totaling more than $1 million. In January, the SEC brought administrative actions against Windsor Street Capital and its former anti-money laundering officer, John Telfer, for allegedly facilitating a $25 million pump-and-dump scheme - in which investors promote or âpumpâ the value of a dubious stock they own just before selling, or âdumpingâ it. Windsor declined to comment to Reuters but denied any misconduct in an SEC filing. The SEC alleges that Windsor allowed clients to sell hundreds of millions of unregistered penny stocks through Windsor brokerage accounts and did not report the suspicious transactions to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Windsor clients bought stock in dormant shell companies, spread false information to promote the companiesâ products and then dumped the shares as other investors bought in at inflated prices, the SEC alleges in a case that is still pending. Windsor made about $500,000 in commissions and fees from transactions related to the scheme, according to the SEC. When asked if FINRA investigators contributed to the SECâs investigation, an SEC official declined to comment and pointed to the agencyâs press release, which only credits SEC investigators. FINRA did not respond to requests for comment on whether it had a role in the Windsor investigation. âHappy New Year!â At Long Island-based Joseph Stone Capital, 71 percent of the firmsâ 59 brokers had FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis. Joseph Stone was investigated by the state of Montana after one of its sales representatives, Lawrence Sullivan, cold-called the office of Montanaâs Commissioner of Securities and Insurance to pitch an investment on January 15, 2016, according to a report on the incident by the regulator. The securities commission launched an investigation into the firm after the call, during which Sullivan quickly backtracked and denied he was pitching securities, according to the report. Reuters could not reach Sullivan for comment. The staffer he called - Patrick Navarro, an assistant analyst at the state regulator - did not respond to requests for comment. Investigators ultimately unearthed âfraudulent and unethicalâ practices, including excessive trading in client accounts - resulting in commissions totaling 28 percent of the $877,493 invested by clients in Montana, according to the regulatorâs report. The firm settled with the state on April 18, agreeing to pay $30,000 in restitution to clients without admitting wrongdoing. During the call that got the firm into trouble, Sullivan pitched Navarro on an investment in Paypal stock, the report said. After Navarro informed Sullivan that he worked for the stateâs securities regulator, Sullivan blurted out âHappy New Year!â and hung up.

Azmoun's goal midway through the first half at the Azadi Stadium put them on track to qualify for a place in Russia before Taremi added a second two minutes from time as Iran reached back-to-back World Cup tournaments for the first time.

Your victory made all of us happy... Guys well done for the qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia,  he tweeted.   Thousands of Iranians spilled onto the streets after the match with impromptu street parties in Tehran and across the country as people danced, waved flags and honked car horns.  People are shouting 'Iran, Iran'... It is like a carnival â¦ We are so happy and proud of our team,  said Iran fan Reza Ghanbari in northern Tehran's Tajrish Square. The win means Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz's Iran team will finish in the top two places in Group A of Asia's final round of qualifying. Uzbekistan are eight points adrift of the leaders in third place and have only two games remaining. The top two teams in each of Asia's two qualifying groups advance automatically to the finals while the teams in third place go through a series of playoffs. Azmoun opened the scoring in the 23rd minute when Alireza Jahanbaksh's through ball found the FC Rostov striker with time and space behind the Uzbek defense to roll the ball under goalkeeper Aleksandr Lobanov and into the net. Captain Masoud Shojaei squandered the chance to double Iran's advantage five minutes into the second half when he fired a penalty over the bar after Taremi had been bundled over in the box by Akmal Shorakhmedov. But Taremi calmed Iran's nerves when he added the second goal late on by curling a low shot into the corner of Lobanov's goal to spark the celebrations amongst the home supporters.

Young men and women poured into the streets in Tehran and other cities immediately after Iran secured its place in next year's World Cup finals with a 2-0 win against Uzbekistan.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani joined the celebrations, saying on Twitter:  Congratulations to the nation and our national team for qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

The celebration came just after the release on Monday of an audio message purporting to come from the spokesman of Islamic State, who called on followers to launch attacks in various countries - including Iran - during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which began in late May and ends in late June. The Sunni militant group carried out twin attacks on Wednesday in Tehran that killed 17 people. From across the country, social media sites showed online video clips of people dancing, waving flags and honking car horns.

The verdict by a jury in New Orleans came in a lawsuit by the husband and children of Sharyn Orr, who blamed her 2015 death following a stroke on inadequate information the companies provided her doctor about the drug's bleeding risks. The case is second in a series of bellwether trials in the federal product liability litigation over Xarelto's bleeding risks. The companies also won in a previous trial on May 3. The two cases are among an estimated 18,600 lawsuits in federal and state courts related to Xarelto. Bellwethers are supposed to help both sides assess similar claims that the companies downplayed the drug's bleeding risks. Bayer in a statement said the two verdicts  affirm both the safety and efficacy of Xarelto, and that its FDA-approved label contains accurate, science-based information on the benefits and risks of this life-saving medicine.  J&J;'s Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc unit in a statement said it will continue to defend against the allegations in the litigation. Andy Birchfield and Brian Barr, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, in a statement said they  will continue to press forward with the legal claims of the thousands of innocent victims of this drug.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Xarelto in 2011. The drug is prescribed for people with a common heart rhythm disorder known as atrial fibrillation and to treat and reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms. But plaintiffs contend Xarelto was unreasonably dangerous and that J&J; and Bayer, which jointly developed it, failed to warn patients about a serious risk of uncontrollable, irreversible bleeding in emergencies. In the trial over Orr's death, her husband, Joseph Orr, and her surviving children said she suffered a stroke in late April 2015, a year after her doctor prescribed her Xarelto to treat her atrial fibrillation. The plaintiffs' lawyers said that based on inadequate information from Bayer and J&J;, a doctor decided to wait 12 hours before operating because he feared the Xarelto she took would cause Orr to bleed out. She died on May 4, 2015, despite the surgery. Bayer and J&J; contended Xarelto's warnings were adequate and that any purported inadequacy did not cause her death.

But the risk of amputations, particularly of toes or feet, was double versus placebo in the studies of 10,142 patients with type 2 diabetes.

But being a U.S. Open, players can expect a mental and physical challenge at the year's second major. The 11-year-old, tree-less course 35 miles (56 km) northwest of Milwaukee stretches beyond 7,700 yards, where calf-length fescue grass waves in the wind alongside fairways.  It's one of the toughest mental tests that you're going to encounter out there, and it's important to be fresh, and at least I think I've got that part,  British Open champion Henrik Stenson of Sweden told reporters on Monday.  I've had a week off in Sweden and haven't really focused much on golf. So at least we're fresh.  Spain's Jon Rahm, a candidate to become the sixth successive first-time major winner, said he also was trying to lessen his stress level before Thursday's start.  I wanted to get some rest at home, work out, practice on my game. And made sure I stayed patient, not get the anticipation built up too high.  Rahm, who tied for 23rd as the low amateur at last year's U.S. Open at Oakmont, has been a sensation since turning professional. He won the Farmers Insurance Open in January and has recorded five more top-five finishes to zoom up the world rankings to number 10. Rahm played a full round of practice on Monday and was full of enthusiasm.  I absolutely love the golf course,  he said.  It's a very long golf course, big greens. ...It's like a links golf course on steroids.  The Spaniard said he plans to dial down his practice to stay fresh.  Played 18 holes today to get a feel of the golf course. I'll play nine tomorrow and nine Wednesday, and after the nine holes try to get my touch around the greens which I think will be very important,  he said. The greens, like the fairways, are full of slope. Although there is no rough around the greens, swales can carry errant approach shots far away from the pins. Stenson took a different approach to getting acclimated.  It's important to have your mental strength and energy over the weekend, if you're going to do well, and not overdo it in the first couple of days,  said Stenson, who added the Olympic silver medal in Rio.  So I walked 18 today, and then I'll play nine tomorrow and nine on Wednesday and that should be good,  Stenson said in between sneezes.  One thing I forgot to say, this is hay fever heaven, and I expect any local pharmacy to sell out of antihistamines. If you haven't gotten yours, make sure you get them quickly.  I forgot to take my pills this morning and I've been sneezing about 50 times already.

The epicenter of the quake was about 84 km (52 miles) northwest of the Turkish coastal city of Izmir and 15 km south of Lesbos, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said on its website. The National Observatory of Athens put it slightly lower at 6.1. Extensive damage was reported at a village on Lesbos, which was at the forefront of a migration crisis two years ago when hundreds of thousands of war refugees landed there seeking a gateway into Europe. TV footage showed collapsed buildings and debris blocking narrow streets at Vrisa, a community of around 600 people to the south of the island.   Tens of buildings have collapsed and roads are blocked off,  said Marios Apostolides, the divisional commander of the fire brigade.  A woman, believed to be about 60, was crushed by the roof of her home and died, the island's mayor said. Local officials said at least 10 people were injured.

The vast majority of recommendations laid out in the Treasury's 150-page report can be accomplished by regulators appointed by President Donald Trump without any legislative changes from Congress, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers Monday. The report relies heavily on those regulators, as the Trump administration cannot count on legislation from Congress. Democrats are resisting major changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that came out of the financial crisis and was a signature achievement for former President Barack Obama. Among other things, the Treasury would expand the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, ease up on the Volcker rule, which restricts banks' ability to place speculative market bets, and reduce the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It would also provide relief for smaller banks by raising a $50 billion asset threshold that now requires tougher regulatory scrutiny.

Dominique Heaggan-Brown, who is also black, is charged with first-degree reckless homicide in the death of 23-year-old Sylville Smith following an Aug. 13 traffic stop. Police said Smith was armed and ignored commands to drop his gun. Heaggan-Brown's attorney could not be reached on Monday. Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm declined to comment on the case, according to his office. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Conen denied a request by Heaggan-Brown's lawyers to delay the case for fear that a jury could be tainted by high emotions sparked by another officer-involved shooting that occurred Sunday night in Milwaukee, according to the court clerk.

Courtesy Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office/Handout via REUTERSIn that incident, a Milwaukee County Sheriff's deputy fired at an SUV following a pursuit that started with an attempted traffic stop, sheriff's officials said. A man was shot in the head and remained on life-support on Monday. A woman was wounded.  The deputy, Michael Truax, was put on administrative leave pending a use-of-force investigation by an outside sheriff's department, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr. said at a news conference. The deputy is white, but officials did not confirm the races of those who were shot. After Smith was shot last year, the resulting violence during protests left businesses burned, police cars damaged and officers injured. Heaggan-Brown was fired from the police force in October over unrelated sexual assault charges. He was charged with assaulting a man a day after he fatally shot Smith. Heaggan-Brown also was charged with having sex with prostitutes and sexually assaulting another person between December 2015 and July 2016, court records said.  The case is one of several ongoing trials involving fatal police shootings of black men. Others include the retrial of former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing, charged in the 2015 murder of an unarmed black motorist, and the trial of Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez in the death of black motorist Philando Castile last year.

The workers were trapped after section two of the Delia mine, part of Mandalay's Cerro Bayo complex in Chile's southern Aysen region, was flooded on Friday. The air force had provided a search robot and regional, national and emergency authorities were coordinating a response, the government said. Families and friends of the miners gathered outside the entrance to the mine, carrying Chilean flags and singing the national anthem. In 2010, a mining accident in Copiapo, northern Chile, led to 33 miners being trapped underground for nearly 10 weeks before being rescued, an event that made world headlines. Mining minister Aurora Williams said the search for the men, identified as Enrique Ojeda and Jorge Sanchez, was the company's responsibility and  as a government we are deploying all specialist teams and technical resources to support that job.  Williams said the chief operating officer of the Canadian-listed company, Dominic Duffy, met her in Santiago on Monday.  We are profoundly saddened by this unexpected event even as we focus our resources on search and rescue,  Mandalay chief executive Mark Sander said in a statement. Sander said flooding had impeded rescue efforts. As with the Copiapo collapse, the mine does have an emergency shelter. On Monday night the rescue teams would start drilling to reach the level where the two men were believed to be working, government mining security engineer Ricardo Berrios said.

Dozens of Iraqi Chaldean Catholics in Detroit, Michigan were among those targeted in immigration sweeps over the weekend, according to immigration attorneys and family members, some of whom feared they would be killed if deported to their home country where they have faced persecution. Kurdish Iraqis were also picked up in Nashville, Tennessee in recent days, attorneys, activists and family members told Reuters. The actions came as part of the Trump administration's push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States.  As a result of recent negotiations between the U.S. and Iraq, Iraq has recently agreed to accept a number of Iraqi nationals subject to orders of removal,  said Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Christensen said the agency arrested individuals who had criminal convictions for violations ranging from homicide to drug charges and had been ordered removed by an immigration judge. She declined to give more details, citing the ongoing nature of the operation. An Iraqi official said Iraqi diplomatic and consular missions would coordinate with U.S. authorities to issue travel documents for the deportees when they can be proven  to be 'Iraqi' based on our records and investigation.  The Iraqi official said around 100 people were arrested just in Detroit over the weekend. Reuters could not independently confirm all of the cases. The moves come after the U.S. government dropped Iraq from a list of countries targeted by a revised version of Trump's temporary travel ban issued in March. The March 6 order said Iraq was taken off the list because the Iraqi government had taken steps  to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal.  There are approximately 1,400 Iraqi nationals with final orders of removal currently in the United States, according to U.S. officials. Iraq had previously been considered one of 23  recalcitrant  countries, along with China, Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia and others, that refused to cooperate with ICE's efforts to remove nationals from the United States, according to ICE. At least some of the people who were picked up came to the United States as children, got in trouble years ago and already served their sentences, according to immigration attorneys and local activists. They had been given an effective reprieve from deportation because Iraq would not take them back.  I understand these are criminals, but they paid their dues,  said Eman Jajonie-Daman, an immigration attorney in Detroit who had been receiving frantic phone calls from clients' families over the weekend.  But we cannot send them back to die.  Trump Supporters Some of the weekend arrests took place in Michigan's Macomb County, which Trump won by 53.6 percent in the 2016 Presidential race, backed by many in the Iraqi Christian community. The community is home to many refugees who have fled Iraq in the face of religious persecution, according to the Chaldean Community Foundation. At least one family of Trump supporters has been affected by the recent enforcement actions. Nahrain Hamama said ICE agents came to her house on Sunday morning and arrested her 54-year-old husband Usama Hamama, a supermarket manager who goes by  Sam.  He has lived in the United States since childhood and has four U.S.-born children. During the election, all his U.S. citizen relatives were Trump supporters, Hamama said.  He forgot his language, he doesn't speak Arabic anymore. We have no family there on both sides. Where would he go? What would he do? How would he live?  Hamama said. She fears for his health and that he will be targeted by groups in Iraq because of his religion, made more visible because of a cross tattooed on his wrist. Sam got in trouble with the law in his 20s, in what his wife called a  road rage  incident where he brandished a gun during a fight in traffic. He served time in prison and was ordered deported after being released. For the past seven years he has regularly checked in with immigration officials, his wife said.  It is a shame that for one mistake, that he paid for legally, now he has to pay with his own life.

Trump Supporters Some of the weekend arrests took place in Michigan's Macomb County, which Trump won by 53.6 percent in the 2016 Presidential race, backed by many in the Iraqi Christian community. The community is home to many refugees who have fled Iraq in the face of religious persecution, according to the Chaldean Community Foundation.  At least one family of Trump supporters has been affected by the recent enforcement actions. Nahrain Hamama said ICE agents came to her house on Sunday morning and arrested her 54-year-old husband Usama Hamama, a supermarket manager who goes by  Sam.  He has lived in the United States since childhood and has four U.S.-born children. During the election, all his U.S. citizen relatives were Trump supporters, Hamama said.  He forgot his language, he doesn't speak Arabic anymore. We have no family there on both sides. Where would he go? What would he do? How would he live?  Hamama said. She fears for his health and that he will be targeted by groups in Iraq because of his religion, made more visible because of a cross tattooed on his wrist.  Sam got in trouble with the law in his 20s, in what his wife called a  road rage  incident where he brandished a gun during a fight in traffic. He served time in prison and was ordered deported after being released. For the past seven years he has regularly checked in with immigration officials, his wife said.  It is a shame that for one mistake, that he paid for legally, now he has to pay with his own life.

Amtrak's work, which will start July 10, was originally scheduled to take years but was expedited after recent derailments and other problems left hundreds of thousands of commuters delayed throughout the greater New York City area because of decaying infrastructure. The repairs, which will take three key tracks offline, will last through Sept. 1. While Amtrak owns and operates the station and is spearheading the repairs, New York's Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and NJ Transit also will see major disruptions because they lease track and station space and will have to reroute trains. Some riders from New Jersey will see 45 minutes added to their commutes each way when their direct service is temporarily halted, and Amtrak is canceling some of its trains from Washington, D.C. During the so-called  summer of agony,  LIRR must cancel or divert 15 trains into Penn Station during morning rush hour, directly impacting at least 9,600 of its roughly 88,000 customers every morning, officials said at a news conference. To make up for it, LIRR will add three new trains into Penn Station and 36 cars to other existing trains. It also will launch two new routes for water ferries and 200 new coach buses from points across Long Island. Unlike NJ Transit, LIRR has no plans to discount fares for inconvenienced passengers.  We've chosen to focus on providing service,  said  Veronique  Ronnie  Hakim, interim director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the LIRR.      Obviously it's going to be a long, hot summer,  she said.  The idea of this service plan is to be as responsive to our customers' needs as possible.  Hakim could not say how much the additional service will cost or how it will be paid for, although she said expenses will not be pushed down onto customers. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also said on Monday he had ordered the MTA to finish major construction on its bridges and tunnels before Amtrak starts its repairs.  The aim, he said, is to help ease the expected additional traffic on roads as train passengers seek other ways to get to work.

The 1.35 million acre (5,463 square kms) area, designated by former President Barack Obama during his final days in office and named for its iconic twin buttes, is the first of 27 national monuments to be reviewed by the Trump administration as part of a plan to increase development on federal lands.  My job is to make sure that I ... reflect the concerns of Utah, and reflect the concerns of the taxpayers and the public who own the lands, and I think we've done that,  Zinke told reporters in a teleconference about his interim recommendation sent to Trump on Saturday. Zinke toured Utah for four days before making the recommendation. His report said that the Antiquities Act, used by past presidents to declare monuments, should cover the  smallest area compatible  with protecting important sites.   Therefore... the Secretary of the Interior recommends that the existing boundary of the (Bears Ears) be modified to be consistent with the intent of the act.  Related CoverageFactbox: Review of U.S. national monuments could unlock new energy reservesRather than designating a vast monument, as Obama did,  it would have been more appropriate to identify and separate the areas that have significant objects to be protected to meet the purposes of the Act,  Zinke's report said. More study is necessary to determine how much smaller Bears Ears should be, Zinke said, and that decision will not be made until all of the 27 monuments are reviewed.  A 13th century masonry structure at an Ancestral Puebloan archaeological site know as Cave Towers is seen in Bears Ears National Monument in the Four Corners region, Utah, U.S. May 16, 2017.Bob StrongJamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said Zinke's recommendation was  nothing less than an attack on the future of all American monuments, parks and public lands,  and was  against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of Americans.   A public comment period that closed in late May generated hundreds of thousands of comments, with the majority expressing hope that monuments like Bears Ears remain protected. Zinke also recommended that tribes be allowed to co-manage  cultural areas  within the resized monument - a nod to Native Americans who had lobbied for protections for the territory - and that Congress review conservation policies in the area. Slideshow (7 Images)His recommendation to Trump set the tone for the administration's broader review, triggered by an executive order in April. Trump had argued that previous administrations  abused  their right to designate monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906 and put millions of acres of land, mainly in western states, off limits to drilling, mining, logging and ranching without adequate input from locals. The review is likely to add fuel to a heated national debate over Washington's role in America's wildest spaces. Environmentalists and tribal groups support federal oversight, but many state political leaders, conservatives and industry groups say the lands should generate money for business, creating jobs, or yielding revenue for education and other public services. While the land encompassed by the Bears Ears monument is not believed to contain huge amounts of coal, oil or gas, several other monuments on Zinke's review list do - making the Bears Ears decision symbolically important to industry groups. Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, representing oil and gas companies, said Zinke's approach was sensible.  It's clear that Bears Ears was an overreach, and was much larger than necessary to protect cultural resources.

Training flights at Arizona's Luke Air Force Base, where the 55 jets are based, were canceled on Friday and scheduled to resume on Monday, but the grounding was extended indefinitely. More than 220 F-35s are flying worldwide. The grounding comes at a critical time for Lockheed, which plans to demonstrate the advanced jet at the Paris Air Show next week. F-35 air operations at other bases continued, U.S. Air Force officials said. The F-35 business accounts for about 37 percent of Lockheed's total revenue. During the first quarter, Lockheed's revenue from its aeronautics business increased 8 percent to $4.11 billion, led by higher sales of the F-35. Luke Air Force Base, located northwest of Phoenix, is home to the 56th Fighter Wing. The base canceled local flying operations for its F-35A Lightning II aircraft due to five incidents in which pilots experienced symptoms resembling hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, Graff said on Friday at the Pentagon. The Air Force said the incidents occurred from May 2 to Thursday, and that in each case the aircraft's backup oxygen system worked as designed and the jets were able to land safely. The base's F-35A Lightning II's typically fly 25 training missions each weekday, base officials said. The halt in flights at Luke Air Force Base was extended so the Air Force could study the issue with pilots, maintenance workers and medical professionals, said Major Rebecca Heyse, a base spokeswoman. Luke is the largest F-35 base in the world and trains U.S. pilots as well as those of allied countries.  A Lockheed representative said the company would help the Air Force address the issue.

Kuwait's foreign minister is making efforts to mediate between our countries. We support this effort and our choice is resolve this through dialogue,  Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told reporters in Paris after meeting his French counterpart.  But there are other problems that need to solved and it seems that they are trying to destroy Qatar. That doesn't seem to be very timely.  Speaking amid a tour of European capitals to gauge support among Doha's traditional allies, Sheikh Mohammed said there was  no proof  to accusations that his country financed terrorist groups, supported the Muslim Brotherhood and the Palestinian group Hamas and had close ties with Iran.  We still have no clue what is behind these measures,  he said.  Whatever is related to the collective security of the Gulf countries, Qatar is ready to negotiate ... but we have the right to react to these accusations that we are interfering in their internal affairs.  Our foreign policy is subject to the sovereignty of our country and is based on our own assessment and our own principles.  The campaign to isolate Qatar is disrupting trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food. It also raises the prospect of a shock to the global gas market, where the Gulf state is a major participant. The Arab states have also accused Doha of undermining other Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority with its backing of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.  Sheikh Mohammed said the allegations on the Muslim Brotherhood were  false  and that it did not understand why it needed to cut ties with Hamas, since it was a resistance movement and not a terrorist group. He said European countries, including France, were trying to ease tensions in support of Kuwait's mediation efforts, and he believed that the United States, which was also backing mediation, wanted restrictions on Doha to be lifted.  We in Qatar are prepared to engage in dialogue positively, but in accordance with the international norms and standards that govern any dialogue as per international law,  Sheikh Mohammed said.

A week after the frontier was shut by the Saudis who accuse Qatar of fomenting regional instability, soldiers in an armored pick-up truck looked out over a barbed-wire fence at sprawling empty dustland separating Qatar from Saudi Arabia. Indian migrants who work at the border in green uniforms lay on inspection platforms sheltering from the sun. Normally, thousands of passengers and hundreds of trucks from Saudi Arabia pass through the crossing each day, bringing fruit and vegetables, as well as construction materials for projects that include stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. Qatar is the world's richest country per capita, with just 2.7 million residents and income from the world's biggest exports of liquefied natural gas. Nearly 90 percent of its population are foreign guest workers, mostly from South Asia or poorer countries in the Middle East. It imported most of its food from its bigger Gulf neighbors before they imposed the economic and diplomatic boycott, forcing Qatar to seek other routes for imports. Qatar's financial markets stabilized on Monday after a week of losses as the government showed it had ways to keep the economy running in the face of sanctions by other Gulf states. A road sign is seen near Abu Samra border crossing to Saudi Arabia, Qatar June 12, 2017.Tom FinnAt the land border, dozens of truck drivers had been stranded on the Qatari side. One Sri Lankan driver asked Qatari border guards if he could drive into Saudi Arabia if he agreed to leave his cargo, a tanker full of helium, behind in Qatar.  We Can Do Nothing  Slideshow (2 Images) We can do nothing,  the border guard told him.  Saudi has shut the border. There is no way to pass.  Staff said the closing of the frontier had divided families. Last week, a Qatari woman was forced to hand her two-year-old son to her Saudi husband across the border after Saudi authorities said she could not enter, Sultan Qahtani, a Qatari police major, told Reuters in his office.   Qataris were affected because they were unable to see their relatives in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain. One of my relatives told me he was unable to travel to Saudi to attend the funeral of a poet,  he said.   I pray to god that the Saudi border will be opened to preserve ties of kinship between Qataris and other GCC nationals. We must concentrate on these families who are apart now,  he said, referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council,  founded in 1981, which includes Qatar and its neighbors. Prominent Arabian tribes have lived for decades on both sides of the border. On weekends, the land border is normally used by thousands of Saudis who cross to take advantage of Qatar's laxer rules and stay in hotels that serve alcohol. A few miles from the border a vast sea-front complex with an aqua park and white-washed villas is being built by the Hilton hotel chain for Saudi tourists.

Mizuho Securities cut its rating on Apple to  neutral  from  buy  on Monday, saying the stock had outperformed this year and that the  upcoming product cycle is fully captured at current levels.  Apple shares, down 2.4 percent on Monday, are up about 26 percent so far in 2017.    The S&P; technology sector fell 0.8 percent after dropping 2.7 percent Friday for its largest two-day decline in nearly a year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed the S&P; 500 as the ongoing rout in the sector sparked a search for value elsewhere. Energy stocks .SPNY, the worst performing sector year-to-date, were among the ones trying to stop the bleeding on the S&P; 500. Despite the flailing leadership in tech stocks, Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, said he is not too worried about it becoming a broader market selloff.  We're not even in correction territory for the Nasdaq or large tech shares. If economic data was worse than what it is, then I'd be worried,  he said.  The risk of recession is still pretty low, so I think this (tech) selloff is not a harbinger.

Jacobsen said he would not yet buy into the market's dip ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting that ends Wednesday, as the Fed is  the biggest risk to the market  in the near-term.  If the Fed dismisses the recent bout of soft data and continues hiking (rates) for the sake of hiking, then we could see a correction  in the stock market, he said.

Overall, however, the increased risk of a motor vehicle accident among people with ADHD is not as high as was reported in previous studies, the researchers found.  It's commonly reported that new drivers with ADHD have a four-fold increased risk of getting into crashes than the general population of young drivers,  senior author Thomas Power, of the Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia, told Reuters Health.  But some have suggested the risk is lower.  People with ADHD may be overactive and have problems with attention and impulsivity, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recent surveys suggest more than one in 10 U.S. children and teens have been diagnosed with ADHD. For the new study, researchers analyzed medical records of 18,344 young residents of New Jersey born between 1987 and 1997, including 2,479 with ADHD. Their medical records were linked with data spanning 2004 through 2014 on licensing and motor vehicle crashes in New Jersey. Compared to young people without ADHD, those with ADHD were 35 percent less likely to obtain a driver's license within six months of becoming eligible for it. This was true for both boys and girls. The researchers can't say why getting a driver's license took longer for young people with ADHD, Power said. Parents may have delayed the driving tests or students may have taken longer to pass the exams. The researchers also found that young people with ADHD were 1.36 times more likely to be involved in a motor vehicle accident during the study period than those without the condition. About 43 percent of young people with ADHD were in a crash, compared to about 36 percent of those without ADHD. The increased crash risk among young drivers with ADHD did not vary by gender or by age when they passed the driving test. There was no extra crash risk for people taking ADHD medications, but Power said the number of participants on treatment was too small to allow for a difference to show up. The study, Power said,  broadly indicates that we need to be concerned about adolescents with ADHD getting a driver's license and we need to provide careful screening, assessment, consultation and coaching.   But given that the increased risk of crashes was nowhere near the four-fold higher odds reported elsewhere,  We donât want to be overly concerned and afraid to proceed as a general rule,  he said. Zheng Chang, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, whose research team recently reported on the benefits of treating ADHD in adult drivers, said parents of teens with ADHD should understand the increased risk of accidents and the benefits of medication.  It is important for parents and teens to keep in mind that ADHD may persist into adolescence and adulthood,  with an associated risk of motor vehicle crashes, Chang told Reuters Health in an email. More research is needed to find out whether ADHD treatment improves long-term crash risks and other outcomes, said Chang, who was not involved with the new study.

May will also want to raise Britain's talks to leave the European Union, which have been put in doubt since her governing Conservative Party suffered the setback in the election and now needs to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish party. But her spokesman said the two leaders will focus on counter-terrorism, and return to May's election campaign pledge to tackle online extremism following two attacks in as many weeks in Manchester and London that killed 30 people.  The counter-terrorism cooperation between British and French intelligence agencies is already strong, but President Macron and I agree that more should be done to tackle the terrorist threat online,  May will say, according to her office. She will add that the measures to  encourage corporations to do more and abide by their social responsibility  could include  creating a new legal liability for tech companies if they fail to remove unacceptable content . It was not clear how much further their talks would build on  discussions at a meeting of the G7 most industrialized nations last month, where the leaders agreed to do more to purge extremist content. Internet firms, such as Google and Twitter, say they are investing heavily and employing thousands of people to take down hate speech and violent content on their platforms, with evidence their efforts are working. But the companies say they also struggle to identify replacement accounts that quickly reappear. After two Islamist attacks in less than two weeks, May's bid  to clamp down on internet extremism has struck a chord with international leaders especially Macron, whose country has suffered several jihadist attacks since 2015.  (At the G7) they had a very good conversation on how they could work together in order to make social media companies do more to address the fact their platforms are used to spread extremism,  May's spokesman said.

Analysts started trimming their growth estimates over the past week, after President Michel Temer came under investigation for allegedly taking bribes and condoning hush money for a potential witness in a corruption probe. The scandal broke as government data showed the economy expanding at the fastest pace in four years, emerging from a deep two-year recession and briefly lifting hopes that Brazil's economy could float clear of the political crisis. On Monday, however, economists in a weekly central bank poll trimmed estimates for Brazil's economic growth in 2017 and 2018 to 0.4 and 2.3 percent respectively, down from 0.5 and 2.4 percent last week.  The recovery process is going to be slow. It will not have the pace we have been waiting for,  said JÃºlio Mereb, an economist with the GetÃºlio Vargas Foundation (FGV).  FGV's Mereb made a deeper cut to his estimates, forecasting GDP to grow 1.8 percent next year instead of 2.5 percent as he previously forecast.  All this will cause a lot of damage to the labor market. The job recovery that we had been expecting to start in the middle of this year will be postponed to the second half of next year,  Mereb said. The recent downturn, Brazil's worst in at least a century, left over 14 million workers unemployed. Brazil's largest bank ItaÃº Unibanco SA (ITUB4.SA) also moderated its bullish economic outlook since the crisis erupted. The bank expects Brazil's GDP to grow 0.3 percent this year and 2.7 percent in 2018, down from 1.0 and 4.0 percent before.  The political turmoil will delay the fiscal reforms, which complicates the task of balancing the budget,  wrote ItaÃº Chief Economist Mario Mesquita. A senior member of Temer's economic team told Reuters that the administration continues to believe it will pass its reform agenda, which includes unpopular changes to social security and labor rules.

Bears Ears: Barack Obama designated this 1.35 million acres in southeastern Utah a national monument in late 2016, shortly before leaving office. The area, which surrounds a pair of iconic buttes, has moderate oil and gas potential, and one oil company, EOG Resources, was granted drilling leases within its boundaries shortly before the designation.  Canyons of the Ancients: Bill Clinton designated this 178,000-acre area in southwestern Colorado a national monument in 2000, but because it was already an active zone for the oil and gas industry, he granted drillers an allowance to continue to operate there, with limitations. Carrizo Plain: Bill Clinton designated this 204,000-acre area in California a national monument in 2001. It is located in an area that has seen oil exploration in the past and has some moderate potential for commercial reservoirs. California Resources Corporation has pre-existing drilling rights on part of the monument, but has not yet made a big find. Grand Staircase-Escalante: Bill Clinton designated this 1.9 million acre swath of southern Utah a national monument in 1996. It holds roughly 62 billion tons of coal, along with coal bed gas, and potentially commercial quantities of oil, according to the Utah Geological Survey. (here ) Upper Missouri River Breaks: Bill Clinton designated this 495,000 acre area of central Montana a national monument in 2001.

Heated Debate The view from Comb Ridge is pictured in Utahâs Bears Ears area of the Four Corners Region, Utah, U.S. December 18, 2016. Picture taken December 18, 2016.Annie KnoxThe review taps into a heated national debate over Washington's role in America's wildest spaces: environmentalists and tribal groups support federal oversight, but many state political leaders, conservatives, and industry groups say the lands should be generating money for business, creating jobs, or yielding revenue for education and other public services. Bears Ears was created after years of lobbying by a coalition of five tribes, who say the area is sacred. Republicans, like Senator Orin Hatch of Utah, have argued, however, that Obama's designation of the Bears Ears monument had weakened education funding in the state through its School and Institutional Trust Lands system - which delivers revenues from land development to schools. While the land encompassed by the Bears Ears monument is not believed to contain huge amounts of coal, oil or gas, several other monuments on Zinke's review list do - making the Bears Ears decision important symbolically to industry groups.

The justices agreed to hear an appeal by Houston-based oilfield services company Oil States International Inc of a lower court's ruling upholding a proceeding called inter partes review in which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office can cancel patents the agency previously granted. The company asserts that because the agency's process does not give patent owners the option of a jury trial, it violates the right to a jury trial enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Under the agency's process, administrative law judges review a patent and decide whether the patent office made a mistake in granting it. The Supreme Court has said there is a right to a jury trial in disputes in which private property can be revoked. Oil States' position is that patents are a type of private property so inter partes reviews are unconstitutional. The patent office used the review process to invalidate one of Oil States' patents at the request of a competitor it had sued for infringement, Greene's Energy Group. The case involves a patent relating to hydraulic fracking but will be closely watched by technology companies because they have frequently used inter partes review to invalidate patents they have been accused of infringing, said Alan Fisch, a patent lawyer at the law firm Fisch Sigler. Apple Inc, Google Inc and Samsung Electronics Co are among the companies that most frequently use inter partes reviews as a defensive strategy in patent disputes. Congress created inter partes review through the America Invents Act of 2011, a law intended to combat companies that assert patents but do not make products of their own, pejoratively called  patent trolls.  The inter partes review process was designed to be cheaper and faster than traditional litigation. Companies hit with patent lawsuits will often respond by initiating a review in the hopes of quickly invalidating the patent at issue.  Use of these procedures has risen in popularity each year and has been somewhat transformative in the way patent litigation is handled,  said Neel Chatterjee, a patent lawyer at the law firm Goodwin Procter. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected Oil States' argument, finding patents are not private property, so the lack of a jury is not unconstitutional. The company then appealed to the Supreme Court.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-patent-idUSL1N1J91Q7"},

Amtrak's work, which will start July 10, was originally scheduled to take years but was expedited after recent derailments and other problems left hundreds of thousands of commuters delayed throughout the greater New York City area because of decaying infrastructure. The repairs, which will take three key tracks offline, will last through Sept. 1. While Amtrak owns and operates the station and is spearheading the repairs, New York's Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and NJ Transit also will see major disruptions because they lease track and station space and will have to reroute trains. Some riders from New Jersey will see 45 minutes added to their commutes each way when their direct service is temporarily halted, and Amtrak is canceling some of its trains from Washington, D.C. During the so-called  summer of agony,  LIRR must cancel or divert 15 trains into Penn Station during morning rush hour, directly impacting at least 9,600 of its roughly 88,000 customers every morning, officials said at a news conference. To make up for it, LIRR will add three new trains into Penn Station and 36 cars to other existing trains. It also will launch two new routes for water ferries and 200 new coach buses from points across Long Island. Unlike NJ Transit, LIRR has no plans to discount fares for inconvenienced passengers.  We've chosen to focus on providing service,  said  Veronique  Ronnie  Hakim, interim director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the LIRR.      Obviously it's going to be a long, hot summer,  she said.  The idea of this service plan is to be as responsive to our customers' needs as possible.  Hakim could not say how much the additional service will cost or how it will be paid for, although she said expenses will not be pushed down onto customers. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also said on Monday he had ordered the MTA to finish major construction on its bridges and tunnels before Amtrak starts its repairs.  The aim, he said, is to help ease the expected additional traffic on roads as train passengers seek other ways to get to work.

After winning support from the Conservatives to stay on as prime minister after Thursday's election, May heads to France, wanting to repair her authority and possibly to bask in the popularity of Emmanuel Macron, who last month swept to victory in a presidential contest. May will also want to raise Britain's talks to leave the European Union, which have been put in doubt since her governing Conservative Party suffered the setback in the election and now needs to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish party. But her spokesman said the two leaders will focus on counter-terrorism, and return to May's election campaign pledge to tackle online extremism following two attacks in as many weeks in Manchester and London that killed 30 people.  The counter-terrorism cooperation between British and French intelligence agencies is already strong, but President Macron and I agree that more should be done to tackle the terrorist threat online,  May will say, according to her office. She will add that the measures to  encourage corporations to do more and abide by their social responsibility  could include  creating a new legal liability for tech companies if they fail to remove unacceptable content . It was not clear how much further their talks would build on  discussions at a meeting of the G7 most industrialized nations last month, where the leaders agreed to do more to purge extremist content. Internet firms, such as Google and Twitter, say they are investing heavily and employing thousands of people to take down hate speech and violent content on their platforms, with evidence their efforts are working. But the companies say they also struggle to identify replacement accounts that quickly reappear. After two Islamist attacks in less than two weeks, May's bid  to clamp down on internet extremism has struck a chord with international leaders especially Macron, whose country has suffered several jihadist attacks since 2015.  (At the G7) they had a very good conversation on how they could work together in order to make social media companies do more to address the fact their platforms are used to spread extremism,  May's spokesman said.

Analysts started trimming their growth estimates over the past week, after President Michel Temer came under investigation for allegedly taking bribes and condoning hush money for a potential witness in a corruption probe. The scandal broke as government data showed the economy expanding at the fastest pace in four years, emerging from a deep two-year recession and briefly lifting hopes that Brazil's economy could float clear of the political crisis. On Monday, however, economists in a weekly central bank poll trimmed estimates for Brazil's economic growth in 2017 and 2018 to 0.4 and 2.3 percent respectively, down from 0.5 and 2.4 percent last week.  The recovery process is going to be slow. It will not have the pace we have been waiting for,  said JÃºlio Mereb, an economist with the GetÃºlio Vargas Foundation (FGV).  FGV's Mereb made a deeper cut to his estimates, forecasting GDP to grow 1.8 percent next year instead of 2.5 percent as he previously forecast.  All this will cause a lot of damage to the labor market. The job recovery that we had been expecting to start in the middle of this year will be postponed to the second half of next year,  Mereb said. The recent downturn, Brazil's worst in at least a century, left over 14 million workers unemployed. Brazil's largest bank ItaÃº Unibanco SA (ITUB4.SA) also moderated its bullish economic outlook since the crisis erupted. The bank expects Brazil's GDP to grow 0.3 percent this year and 2.7 percent in 2018, down from 1.0 and 4.0 percent before.  The political turmoil will delay the fiscal reforms, which complicates the task of balancing the budget,  wrote ItaÃº Chief Economist Mario Mesquita. A senior member of Temer's economic team told Reuters that the administration continues to believe it will pass its reform agenda, which includes unpopular changes to social security and labor rules. Still, the central bank has suggested the crisis may slow the pace of coming interest rate cuts. While the bank is still expected to reduce its benchmark rate from 10.25 percent to 8.50 percent by year-end, according to the weekly analyst survey, it signaled that its next rate cuts could be smaller than the 100-basis-point reduction last month.

Without this step, downgrades to the first level of junk by S&P; or Moody's Investors Service could have forced the cash-strapped state to pay the banks as much as $39 million in fees to end the swaps, according to the Illinois Comptroller's office. Eleni Demertzis, the governor's spokeswoman, said the rating levels that would trigger the termination of four swaps - two with Barclays Bank, and one each with Bank of America and JP Morgan - were dropped a notch to the second level of junk - BB with S&P; or Ba2 with Moody's. Illinois moved an uncomfortable step closer to the previous triggers this month with downgrades to one notch above junk by S&P; and Moody's. S&P; warned the state could fall to junk - a first for any U.S. state - if it fails to enact a budget for  fiscal 2018 that addresses a big structural deficit. The new fiscal year begins on July 1. After hiring swap and legal experts, the state last year renegotiated the deals with the banks, lowering the termination triggers to the first level of junk ratings. The ratings trigger for the largest swap deal with Deutsche Bank that has a termination payout of about $70 million was changed last year to BB or Ba2. An impasse between Illinois' Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for nearly two straight fiscal years. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a deal for an unprecedented third fiscal year. Since then, House Democrats launched a new round of budget hearings. There have been no signs of a deal. The swaps, aimed at hedging interest-rate risk, are related to $600 million of outstanding variable-rate debt that Illinois sold in 2003 with a final maturity in 2033. The deals proved costly to Illinois after interest rates dropped in the wake of the Great Recession. Demertzis said terms of the renegotiated swap deals were not immediately available. The state also ended the need for letters of credit on the bonds last year by placing the debt with banks for a two-year term.

The Cadiz Knutsen tanker will go to the Taichung LNG terminal in Taiwan with a load of supercooled gas from Cheniere Energy Inc's Sabine, according to Reuters and Genscape shipping data. The increase in U.S. deliveries coincides with the LNG market worries that Qatar, the world's biggest LNG exporter, could experience problems delivering fuel to some countries after Saudi Arabia and a few other Arab nations severed diplomatic and transport links with the gulf sheikhdom after accusing the country of sponsoring terrorism. In May, a record 18 vessels picked up cargoes from Sabine Pass. Those vessels, which had a total capacity of around 59.5 billion cubic feet, went to several countries, including Brazil, the UAE, Mexico, China, South Korea, Argentina and the first exports to the Netherlands and Poland. Based on an average price of $3.12 per million British thermal units at the Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana in May, the value of gas shipped from Sabine last month was about $192 million. The first vessel left Sabine in February 2016. Each of the three liquefaction trains operating at Sabine can process about 0.65 billion cubic feet of gas per day. A fourth 0.65-bcfd train is expected to enter service during the second half of 2017.

Without this step, downgrades to the first level of junk by S&P; or Moody's Investors Service could have forced the cash-strapped state to pay the banks as much as $39 million in fees to end the swaps, according to the Illinois Comptroller's office. Eleni Demertzis, the governor's spokeswoman, said the rating levels that would trigger the termination of four swaps - two with Barclays Bank, and one each with Bank of America and JP Morgan - were dropped a notch to the second level of junk - BB with S&P; or Ba2 with Moody's. Illinois moved an uncomfortable step closer to the previous triggers this month with downgrades to one notch above junk by S&P; and Moody's. S&P; warned the state could fall to junk - a first for any U.S. state - if it fails to enact a budget for  fiscal 2018 that addresses a big structural deficit. The new fiscal year begins on July 1. After hiring swap and legal experts, the state last year renegotiated the deals with the banks, lowering the termination triggers to the first level of junk ratings. The ratings trigger for the largest swap deal with Deutsche Bank that has a termination payout of about $70 million was changed last year to BB or Ba2. An impasse between Illinois' Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for nearly two straight fiscal years. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a deal for an unprecedented third fiscal year. Since then, House Democrats launched a new round of budget hearings. There have been no signs of a deal. The swaps, aimed at hedging interest-rate risk, are related to $600 million of outstanding variable-rate debt that Illinois sold in 2003 with a final maturity in 2033. The deals proved costly to Illinois after interest rates dropped in the wake of the Great Recession. Demertzis said terms of the renegotiated swap deals were not immediately available. The state also ended the need for letters of credit on the bonds last year by placing the debt with banks for a two-year term.

A federal jury in March found Barry Cadden, the co-founder and ex-president of New England Compounding Center, guilty on racketeering and fraud counts but cleared him of the most serious charges, second-degree murder, for his role in a meningitis outbreak that sickened 753 people in 20 states, killing 64. But when the 12 jurors filled out their verdict slip, rather than just checking findings of  guilty  or  not guilty,  they filled in numbers that prosecutors now say reflected vote counts showing a majority found Cadden guilty on 21 of 25 murder counts. The U.S. Attorney's office in Massachusetts argued in a motion filed on Monday that the verdict form showed jurors believed Cadden was guilty of murder and want the judge to consider that fact in determining his sentence on June 26. Former prosecutors said they had never seen a verdict slip quite like it.  While they failed to reach unanimity on these racketeering acts, the jury's verdict confirmed that the murder racketeering acts were proven by a preponderance of the evidence in this case, and can be properly considered at sentencing,  prosecutors wrote in the filing. Their argument might work since judges at sentencing can consider conduct proven by a standard lower than what jurors are instructed to follow to convict someone, said David Schumacher, former deputy chief of the health fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney's office.  They have a very good argument,  he said.  They actually have documentary evidence prosecutors never have in criminal cases.  A conviction on any of the 25 acts of second-degree murder Cadden faced under a racketeering law could have exposed him to life in prison. He could still face decades behind bars. A lawyer for Cadden did not respond to a request for comment. In court papers, his lawyers have disputed that the jury did not clearly acquit him and said prosecution claims to the contrary were  wishful thinking.  Cadden, 50, was one of only two out of 14 people indicted in 2014 connected to the scandal at the Framingham, Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center to face murder charges. The other murder defendant, former supervisory pharmacist Glenn Chin, is scheduled go on trial on Sept. 19. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said that in 2012, the compounding pharmacy sent out 17,600 vials of steroids labeled sterile that were contaminated with mold to 23 states and that Cadden ignored the rules and put profits before patients. Cadden denied wrongdoing.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/massachusetts-meningitis-idUSL1N1J91PF"},

Under the agreement, GE will combine Baker Hughes with its oil and gas business, creating a company with $23 billion in annual revenue, the companies said. GE will pay existing Baker Hughes shareholders $7.4 billion for a special dividend. Following the approval, shares of Baker Hughes added slightly to gains to close up 1.1 percent at $56.16.

The company's shares were down 1.4 pct at $63.50 in after-market trading on Monday. Merck said the action followed recommendation by an external data monitoring committee and that patients currently enrolled in the two studies would continue to receive the treatment. The trials included combinations with Celgene Corp's Pomalyst and Revlimid.  Multiple myeloma is a type of aggressive and incurable blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow.  Keytruda belongs to a closely watched new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that help the immune system fight cancer by blocking a mechanism tumors use to evade attack. In May, Keytruda became the first cancer drug ever approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on a patients' specific genetic traits, regardless of where in the body the disease originated. Keytruda is also approved to treat lung cancer, bladder cancer, advanced melanoma, as well as refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that starts in white blood cells.

Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said first-quarter growth was  pretty impressive  and that signs economic growth was broadening would lead the central bank to consider whether current low rates would still be required.                   It's quite the turn from hinting at cuts at the start of the year to decidedly neutral to now pointing to hikes in the forecast horizon,  said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.     The Canadian dollar reacted immediately to the release of Wilkins' prepared remarks at 1:20 p.m. EDT (1720 GMT) and continued to strengthen through the afternoon.     At 4 p.m. EDT, the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3331 to the greenback, or 75.01 U.S. cents, up 1 percent.     The currency hit C$1.3322 during the trading session, its strongest level since April 18.     Canadian government bond prices fell across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 19.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.844 percent, and the 10-year             falling 57 Canadian cents to yield 1.488 percent.     The yield on the 2-year hit its highest since March while the 10-year touched a more than two-week high.     The central bank makes its next rate decision on July 12. While many economists had expected the bank to start raising in 2018, markets had priced in a 56 percent chance of a hike by the end of 2017 following Wilkins' speech.      The loonie, as the currency is known colloquially, had touched its strongest since late May on Friday, when data showed job growth accelerated in May at its fastest pace in eight months.                  Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, edged up on signs of U.S. inventory declines and news that Saudi Arabia will limit volumes of crude to some Asian buyers in July and deepen cuts to the United States.           The U.S. dollar        dipped against a basket of major currencies ahead of Wednesday's decision by the Federal Reserve on U.S. interest rates, while the euro was lifted by election results in France and Italy.                              The foreign exchange options market is showing much less risk of a sharp drop in the Canadian dollar than before last November's U.S. presidential election, which could spell bad news for speculators who have heavily shorted the currency.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index closed down 89.41 points, or 0.58 percent, at 15,383.80. Seven of its 10 main sectors fell. Investor enthusiasm for equity markets has been dampened by stretched valuations, said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates.  The assumptions have been that politics and interest rates wouldn't matter that much ... I think some of those assessments are coming out of the market.  The Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to raise interest rates for the third time since December, while comments by a senior Bank of Canada official raised the prospect that the central bank could hike rates sooner than investors had anticipated. The tech sector lost 2 percent as CGI Group lost 1.5 percent to C$66.15 and BlackBerry Ltd tumbled nearly 5 percent to C$14.11. The financials group, which accounts for one third of the TSX's weight, declined 0.7 percent. Royal Bank of Canada fell 1.1 percent to C$94.26. The energy sector was little changed as oil prices broke a three-day losing streak despite rising U.S. drilling. U.S. crude oil futures settled 25 cents higher at $46.08 a barrel. Cenovus Energy <CVE.TO advanced 2.4 percent to C$11.37 but Enbridge Inc fell 2.2 percent to C$51.00. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, fell 0.8 percent. Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc dropped 1.7 percent to C$22.51, while gold was little changed at $1,265.20 an ounce ahead of the Fed meeting this week. Shares of aircraft manufacturer Bombardier rose nearly 3 percent to C$2.44, recovering from a decline on Friday, when the U.S. International Trade Commission gave a green light to the U.S. Commerce Department to begin preparing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties against Bombardier's new jets.

One of the world's largest digital currency companies with operations in 32 countries, Coinbase engineers and support teams have been working to keep up with the volume, the exchange said in a statement to Reuters. The market capitalization of digital currencies has increased by around 95 percent to $106 billion over the past month as demand for crypto-assets has soared with the creation of new tokens to raise funding for start-ups using blockchain technology. This is the second time in about two weeks that Coinbase had  an outage due to a surge in trading volume.  Coinbase has two trading platforms, one for retail investors and one for institutions. The outage occurred just as bitcoin had a more than 10 percent drop in the price to $2,640, on the Bitstamp platform. Customers voiced on Twitter their displeasure at Coinbase for the outage, as it prevented them from taking advantage of the dip in price to buy bitcoins. Despite Monday's fall in price, bitcoin still was up more 170 percent so far this year.  At the same time that bitcoin dropped, another digital currency ethereum soared to record highs on Monday. Ethereum, which has the second-largest market capitalization behind bitcoin, soared to $373.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals used narrow grounds to reject the Trump administration's bid to undo a Hawaii federal judge's decision blocking the temporary ban. It said the Republican president's March 6 order violated existing immigration law. But the three-judge panel - all Democratic appointees - did not address whether it was unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims. A second court, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld a Maryland judge's ruling that also blocked Trump's 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The 4th Circuit had ruled that the ban, which replaced an earlier Jan. 27 one also blocked by the courts,  drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination  aimed at Muslims. The 9th Circuit largely left in place a nationwide injunction by Judge Derrick Watson that stopped parts of the order, which Trump said was urgently needed to prevent terrorism in the United States. That ruling came in a lawsuit challenging the order brought by the state of Hawaii, which stated the ban would harm its universities and tourism industry. Even before Monday's ruling, the case was on the fast track to the Supreme Court, where the administration on June 1 filed an emergency request seeking to reinstate the order and hear its appeal of the 4th Circuit ruling. The Supreme Court could act on the administration's request as soon as this week. Trump has been on the losing side in all four court rulings on the March order. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration is reviewing Monday's decision and expressed continued confidence that the order is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the Supreme Court.  I think we can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence,  Spicer told a briefing. The 9th Circuit upheld the block on Trump's three-month travel ban for the six countries and four-month suspension of all refugee admissions. But the court pared back part of Watson's injunction in order to allow the government to conduct internal reviews on vetting procedures for these travelers. The administration said the travel ban was needed to allow time to implement stronger vetting measures, although it has already rolled out some new requirements not blocked by courts, including additional questions for visa applicants. Rather than focusing on Trump campaign statements as the Virginia-based court did, the 9th Circuit said the language in the executive order itself did not make a rational case for why a travel ban was needed.  The order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality,  the court wrote, referring the combined populations of the six countries. 'Attractive Way' Under immigration law, the administration was required to make findings that entry of the people in question would be detrimental to the United States but failed to do so, the court said. Stephen Vladeck, a professor at University of Texas School of Law, said the 9th Circuit provided an easier path for the Supreme Court to keep the travel ban on hold, because it avoided entirely the controversy over Trump's campaign statements.  It provides a very attractive way to leave the injunction in place without setting broader doctrinal rules about which they may have pause,  Vladeck said. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  Monday was the deadline for the ban's challengers to respond to the administration's request that the order be allowed to go into effect. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents people challenging the ban in the separate Maryland suit handled by the 4th Circuit, filed court papers urging the court not to take up the case, saying the order will become moot on Wednesday, 90 days from when Trump issued it. Lawyers for Hawaii called the order a  thinly veiled Muslim ban.  Trump's earlier Jan. 27 order also included Iraq among the countries targeted and a total ban on refugees from Syria. The March order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but was blocked before it could go into effect on March 16. The suits by Hawaii and the Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution's First Amendment that prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. Hawaii's court papers mentioned a series of Trump Twitter posts on June 5. Trump described the order as a  watered down, politically correct  version of his original one.

So long as uncertainty is there I don't see that as particularly positive for M&A; in the short term,  Karen Cook, chair of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, said at the Reuters Global M&A; summit.   I think the problem is there is a government with different views amongst the Tory (Conservative) party, who are not all aligned to hard Brexit.   A failed gamble on a snap election has weakened Britain's hand just days before formal talks on leaving the European Union.

Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A; at JPMorgan, said that dealmaking would likely be driven by what happens in the currency markets.  What I follow more than hard or soft Brexit is what happens to sterling and post-election there is renewed weakness in sterling,  said Cristerna, noting a weaker pound could spark deals as happened after last year's Brexit vote.

There clearly is increased protectionism in the UK and the US,  said Cook.  If this government wants to have more protectionism they ought to do it through legislation not through the back door on takeover rules because I think the takeover rules broadly work.

You (the United States) and your agents are the source of instability in the Middle East...who created Islamic State? America ... America's claim of fighting against Islamic State is a lie,  Khamenei said in a meeting with high-ranking Iranian officials, according to his official website. Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution and enmity to Washington has long been a rallying point for hardline supporters of Khamenei in Iran. Khamenei has made several statements denouncing the United States since the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, while U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken out against Iran in harsh terms since taking office, indicating that he will reverse the previous administration's attempts at rapprochement with Tehran. The Iranian leader has accused the United States and its regional ally Saudi Arabia of funding hardline Sunni militants, including Islamic State, which carried out its first attack in Iran on Wednesday in Tehran, killing 17 people.  Riyadh has denied involvement in the suicide bombings and gun attacks on Iran's parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who favors opening up to the world, has condemned the attacks, without pointing a finger at any country.      The pragmatist president championed a nuclear deal with the United States and five other powers in 2015 that led to the lifting of most sanctions against Iran, in return for curbs on its nuclear program.  But the deal has not led to normalization of ties between the two countries that Rouhani hoped for. Trump has frequently called the agreement  one of the worst deals ever signed  and said Washington would review it. Khamenei said Iran had no intention of normalizing ties with the United States.  The American government is against an independent Iran ... They have problems with the existence of Islamic Republic of Iran...Most of our problems with them cannot be resolved,  the semi-official Fars news agency quoted him as saying. Khamenei's hardline loyalists, drawn from among Islamists and the Revolutionary Guards, fear that normalization of ties with the United States might weaken their position.  America is a terrorist country and backs terrorism ... therefore, we cannot normalize ties with such country,  he said.

The board, at a meeting on Sunday, adopted a series of recommendations from former U.S Attorney General Eric Holder following a sprawling, multi-month investigation into Uber's cultures and practices. The recommendations will be released to Uber employees on Tuesday, said the representative, who declined to be identified. Holder and his law firm were retained by Uber in February to investigate company practices after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post detailing what she described as sexual harassment and the lack of a suitable response by senior managers. The recommendations in Holder's firm's report are expected to force greater controls on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Chief Executive Travis Kalanick have had a surprising amount of autonomy for a company with more than 12,000 employees, a source familiar with the matter said. The meeting, which Uber did not publicize, is a pivotal moment for the world's most valuable venture-backed private company that has upended the tightly regulated taxi industry in many countries but has also run into legal trouble with a rough-and-tumble approach to local regulations and the way it handles employees and drivers. Uber's image, culture and practices have been largely defined by Kalanick's brash approach, company insiders and investors previously told Reuters. Also at the meeting on Sunday, board members were expected to discuss Kalanick temporarily stepping away from the embattled ride-hailing firm - possibly returning to a role with less authority - and other changes to executive leadership. The company also plans to appoint Wan Ling Martello, an executive vice president at Nestle SA, to the board, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. (bloom.bg/2rhUeAc) The board's decisions follow a series of public-relations crises for Uber. The company faces a criminal probe related to a technology it created called Greyball that was used to deceive regulators in cities where it was operating. Uber's self-driving car program is in jeopardy after a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc alleging trade secrets theft, and the company has suffered an exodus of several of its top executives. One Uber investor called the board's decisions on Sunday a step in the right direction, giving Uber an  opportunity to reboot.

Separately, a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court announced it would issue a ruling on the same issue on Monday. Lawyers for Hawaii, which challenged Trump's ban in court and won a nationwide injunction blocking it, said in court papers his executive order is a  thinly veiled Muslim ban.  Trump's administration on June 1 filed emergency applications with the nine Supreme Court justices seeking to undo two different lower court rulings that blocked his March 6 order barring entry for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the U.S. government implements stricter visa screening. The administration has said the order is needed to prevent terrorism in the United States. Federal courts in both Maryland and Hawaii issued rulings suspending key parts of the ban. A Virginia-based appeals court upheld the Maryland ruling. In the Hawaii case, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said on Monday a ruling is  imminent.  In deciding whether to allow the ban to go into effect, the Supreme Court is set to weigh whether Trump's comments as a presidential candidate can be used as evidence that the executive order was intended to discriminate against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment ban on the government favoring one religion over another. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  Monday is the deadline for the ban's challengers to respond to the administration's request that the order be allowed to go into effect. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents people challenging the ban in a separate Maryland case, is due to file its own response later on Monday. Hawaii's court papers mentioned a series of Twitter posts that Trump wrote on June 5, after the administration sought Supreme Court intervention. Trump described the order, which replaced an earlier Jan. 27 order that also was blocked by courts, as a  watered down, politically correct  version of his original plan. Hawaii's lawyers said that Trump has made  a series of barely veiled statements linking the orders to his promised Muslim ban.  If he had not done so, the order may not violate the Constitution, the lawyers said. The administration has said courts should not second guess the president's assertion that the ban was needed for national security reasons.

With their striking black, red and white hulls and  wing  foil and revolutionary  cycling  system for powering their on-board hydraulics, the New Zealand team led by Glenn Ashby and helmed by Peter Burling have been hot favorites throughout. They bounced back from a near-catastrophic capsize last week when racing Land Rover BAR, getting their 50-foot (15 meter) catamaran and towering wing foil repaired in time to beat the British crew and progress to the Challenger final.

There were celebrations aboard the New Zealand catamaran after they crossed the line nearly a minute ahead of the Swedish boat after an earlier race had to be abandoned when the wind dropped away and left both teams drifting.

The Louis Vuitton America's Cup Match, which is a first-to-seven race event, is due to start on June 17.

Outteridge, 31, and Burling, 26, were more accustomed to head-to-head battles in relatively tiny two-man 49er skiffs. While Outteridge won Olympic gold in 2012, Burling got his revenge in 2016 in Rio, relegating his rival to silver. Both men have been sailing with their 49er partners in the America's Cup competition, with Burling's crew Blair Tuke joining him in the New Zealand boat and Outteridge's team mate Iain Jensen aboard the Artemis catamaran as a  grinder .

The U.S. Commerce Department's regulations  hit list  recommendations follow more than three months of study and consultation with industry on ways to streamline regulations and ease burdens on manufacturing firms. A Trump administration official with knowledge of the recommendations to be sent to the White House said the Environmental Protection Agency's complex permitting rules will be a key focus, echoing comments to Reuters by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month. The 171 public comments submitted by companies and industry groups offer a strong hint to priorities for Commerce's streamlining efforts, with numerous industry groups and firms complaining that EPA air quality permit rules for new facilities are often redundant. The report will analyze the submissions and  will identify a lot of problems and lay out ways to take responsible actions,  saidd the official, who declined to be identified by name. The process has looked at many regulations finalized under Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama. A common demand from industry was that the Trump administration should reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards, with several groups arguing this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for new facilities, raising costs. 3M Co said other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act contained  overlapping rules, redundant requirements, conflicts between rules and undue complexity.  The National Association of Manufacturers said the EPA's review requirements for new sources of emissions such as factories can add $100,000 in costs for modeling air quality to a new facility and delay factory expansions by 18 months. It added that EPA should find ways to ease burdens for smaller projects and smaller firms. Also drawing complaints from construction groups and iron foundries is an incoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule reducing by 80 percent the amount of crystalline silica dust that can be inhaled. The dust, common on construction sites, can cause lung cancer, according to OSHA, but industry groups say reducing it to those levels will be prohibitively expensive.  To meet these much lower levels, new engineering controls and other measures will become necessary within the roofing industry,  said the National Roofing Contractors Association. Trump has already taken steps to roll back some not fully completed Obama-era environmental regulations such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants and a clean water rule greatly restricting runoff into small streams. But the Commerce list may target some rules already on the books.  We are at the outset of what we think will be a very intense deregulatory agenda from the Trump team,  said Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group.  We are concerned that they are looking to gut regulations that benefit workers and benefit consumers.  Another OSHA rule that drew industry complaints is one that further reduces worker exposure to beryllium, another potential carcinogen, that became effective on May 20 after a decade-long rulemaking effort. Manufacturing groups including auto parts makers have also targeted labor rules that make it easier for unions to organize workers, expand the number of employees eligible for overtime and govern the reporting of workplace injuries. The range of industry complaints is vast. Mining giant Freeport-McMoRan argued that planned EPA financial responsibility requirements for hard rock mining operations costing billions of dollars were based on inadequate study and  will have disastrous consequences for the mining industry.  Guitar maker Taylor Guitars said that permits needed from the Fish and Wildlife Service for mother-of-pearl used to decorate instruments was unnecessarily raising its costs.  This declaration requirement does not seem to serve any conservation or other purpose. The shell is not a species that is protected under law,  the company said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-regulation-idUSL1N1J91KV"},

Lower-than-expected prices in cash cattle markets late last week further weighed on futures, even as rising U.S. wholesale beef prices suggested meat demand remained strong.     Chicago Mercantile Exchange June live cattle        briefly declined by their 3.000 cents daily price limit, before settling 2.900 cents lower at 128.350 cents per pound, a more than one-week low. Most-active CME August live cattle        was 2.300 cents lower at 121.550 cents, finishing below its 10-day moving average for the first time this month.      There's enough people around who don't think beef prices can hold at these levels,  independent livestock trader Dan Norcini said of the selling in cattle futures.     Wholesale beef already was trading at the highest levels in roughly 23 months and prices added to those gains on Monday, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.                But demand generally from retailers generally peaks around this time of year as consumers cook fewer roasts and steaks.      There's a seasonal tendency - beef and cattle prices don't fare well in the heat of the summer,  Norcini said.      CME August feeder cattle futures        finished 2.625 cents lower at 151.550 cents per pound, lowest since May 31. Feeders also eased at a cash cattle auction in Oklahoma City, USDA said.                  CME June hogs        were down 0.500 cent to 81.975 cents per pound and July hog futures        off 2.000 cents to 80.700 cents.       Felt like a lot of fund selling today,  said Rosenthal Collins broker James Burns.     Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday showed noncommercial investors, a category that includes hedge funds, trimming their net long stake in live cattle futures and increased their net long in lean hogs.                  USDA on Monday said 411,000 hogs were slaughtered, down from 440,000 a week ago.                The lower slaughter total indicated that at least one U.S. pork packing plant likely was not slaughtering hogs. There was widespread talk that a facility in Oklahoma was shut down due to a chemical leak but that could not be confirmed. The owner of the plant did not respond to requests for comment.     Cash hogs in the top market of Iowa and southern Minnesota were up $1.21 higher to $77.24 per cwt. Wholesale pork prices edged 69 cents higher to $93.14 per cwt.

The justices agreed to hear an appeal by Houston-based oilfield services company Oil States International Inc of a lower court's ruling upholding a proceeding called inter partes review in which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office can cancel patents the agency previously granted. The company asserts that because the agency's process does not give patent owners the option of a jury trial, it violates the right to a jury trial enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Under the agency's process, administrative law judges review a patent and decide whether the patent office made a mistake in granting it. The Supreme Court has said there is a right to a jury trial in disputes in which private property can be revoked. Oil States' position is that patents are a type of private property so inter partes reviews are unconstitutional.  The patent office used the review process to invalidate one of Oil States' patents at the request of a competitor it had sued for infringement, Greene's Energy Group.

Dozens of people have been killed in protests against Maduro's socialist government since April.  If nothing is done, we are going to end up with a sea full of blood,  said Kuczynski, a former banker who has taken the lead among Latin American leaders in criticizing Maduro. He warned of the threat of massive immigration to Colombia, and said desperate refugees might even try to get to the Caribbean island of Curacao, risking a replay of the deadly Mediterranean journeys of refugees from Syria and Iraq.  We have to avoid that. If Latin America has any solidarity among countries, we have to try to find a solution,  Kuczynski  said, according to a statement from his office in Lima. Venezuela has lost many regional allies as several Latin American countries have moved to the right in recent years. Human rights groups have criticized the Venezuelan government's response to the protests, saying its  excessive use of force  and militarization have escalated the violence.

Speaking just before an executive meeting of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, or PSDB, they said a decision to stick with Temer was based on the need to support his austerity program in congress to balance Brazil's overdrawn fiscal accounts. Senior leaders of the party have managed to hold back a movement by younger lawmakers who want to quit the government and pull the four PSDB ministers out of Temer's cabinet. Temer's acquittal on Friday in an illegal campaign funding case dating from the 2014 election strengthened the president's position among some of those wavering in the PSDB.  The government has retained its legitimacy by not being removed by the electoral court, and our party is committed to its policies that are needed for the recovery of the economy,  national executive member Jose Anibal told Reuters. Temer's unpopular fiscal reforms, particularly an overhaul of the costly pension system, are seen as crucial for Brazil to bring a gaping budget deficit under control and regain investor confidence. But Temer's administration has been shaken by accusations he endorsed payment of hush money to buy the silence of a potential witness in a corruption probe and took bribes from giant meatpacker JBS SA. Temer is being investigated for corruption and obstruction of justice. Brazil's top prosecutor is expected to file charges against the president in the coming days. Another PSDB executive member said a majority of the party's 46 lawmakers in the lower chamber of Congress wanted to abandon Temer's coalition. They are worried voters will punish them at the polls next year for being part of a government widely perceived as corrupt.  Our party has not won an election in 16 years and the electorate has changed a lot. Voters no longer tolerate traditional political practices,  the PSDB leader said, requesting anonymity to speak more freely. Corruption allegations that led to the ousting of the PSDB's former leader and presidential candidate in 2014, Aecio Neves, have weakened the party and made it imperative to take distance from Temer, he said. The lawmaker wants the party to remove its ministers from Temer's government while making clear to markets that it fully backs his reform proposals.

The justices agreed to hear an appeal by Houston-based oilfield services company Oil States International Inc of a lower court's ruling upholding a proceeding called inter partes review in which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office can cancel patents the agency previously granted. The company asserts that because the agency's process does not give patent owners the option of a jury trial, it violates the right to a jury trial enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Under the agency's process, administrative law judges review a patent and decide whether the patent office made a mistake in granting it. The Supreme Court has said there is a right to a jury trial in disputes in which private property can be revoked. Oil States' position is that patents are a type of private property so inter partes reviews are unconstitutional.  The patent office used the review process to invalidate one of Oil States' patents at the request of a competitor it had sued for infringement, Greene's Energy Group. The case involves a patent relating to hydraulic fracking but will be closely watched by technology companies because they have frequently used inter partes review to invalidate patents they have been accused of infringing, said Alan Fisch, a patent lawyer at the law firm Fisch Sigler.

The NEB's changes must pass external standards committees that include the pipeline industry and would change the way manufacturers have been designing parts, making production more complicated, NEB chief engineer Iain Colquhoun said. The NEB will set out precise measures after a multi-party workshop in June, Colquhoun said in an interview in late May.  They're big changes in philosophy because the standards that we are (currently) using evolved over many decades,  The changes are unlikely to significantly affect pipeline operators, although parts manufacturers may see some increased costs as they try to meet new requirements. The NEB in April warned about parts from Tecnoforge, a subsidiary of Italy's Valvitalia SpA (IPO-VALIT.MI), and South Korea's TK Corp, but did not name the companies using them. An internal NEB memo seen by Reuters under access-to-information laws named TransCanada as the company using Tecnoforge fittings and noted it had two similar cases with other manufacturers. Colquhoun, who spoke to Reuters after it had seen the memo, identified Enbridge as the company using TK Corp fittings. TransCanada and Enbridge said in separate statements they acted immediately and proactively after discovering the issues and that all their pipes were safe. Valvitalia and TK Corp declined to comment, with the latter calling the issue  sensitive.  Both firms discovered the substandard parts prior to putting them into operation, and the companies were not penalized. Pipe parts are usually made stronger than needed, and the substandard ones had not caused safety issues, but the  repeated occurrence  of the matter demands broad action, according to the NEB memo, dated October 2016. Colquhoun said the NEB would push for manufacturing processes in which strength was determined at the design level through more calculations in coming up with attributes such as thickness and diameter. The NEB may also push for other changes to production processes, including in heat treatment, he said. According to the NEB, TransCanada discovered a substandard Tecnoforge fitting in 2016 on a compressor station on its Nova Gas Transmission Ltd network, which spans the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The company has since removed at least 44 of its  several hundred  fittings from the maker installed since 2011, the NEB said. According to the NEB, Enbridge discovered a substandard TK Corp part in 2012 on a minor pipeline system under the authority of the province of Alberta. Enbridge said that it has replaced more than 400 fittings, although it did not name the pipeline system they had been on.

Mizuho Securities cut its rating on Apple to  neutral  from  buy  on Monday, saying the stock had outperformed this year and that the  upcoming product cycle is fully captured at current levels.  Apple shares, down 2.4 percent on Monday, are up about 26 percent so far in 2017.    The S&P; technology sector fell 0.8 percent after dropping 2.7 percent Friday for its largest two-day decline in nearly a year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed the S&P; 500 as the ongoing rout in the sector sparked a search for value elsewhere. Energy stocks .SPNY, the worst performing sector year-to-date, were among the ones trying to stop the bleeding on the S&P; 500. Despite the flailing leadership in tech stocks, Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, said he is not too worried about it becoming a broader market selloff.  We're not even in correction territory for the Nasdaq or large tech shares. If economic data was worse than what it is, then I'd be worried,  he said.  The risk of recession is still pretty low, so I think this (tech) selloff is not a harbinger.  CEO Tim Cook speaks during WWDC.Stephen LamThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 36.3 points, or 0.17 percent, to 21,235.67, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 2.38 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,429.39 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 32.45 points, or 0.52 percent, to 6,175.47. Jacobsen said he would not yet buy into the market's dip ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting that ends Wednesday, as the Fed is  the biggest risk to the market  in the near-term.  If the Fed dismisses the recent bout of soft data and continues hiking (rates) for the sake of hiking, then we could see a correction  in the stock market, he said. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S.,  June 2, 2017.Brendan McDermidGeneral Electric (GE.N) was the S&P;'s biggest boost with a 3.6 percent advance to $28.94. Jeff Immelt will retire as chief executive and would be replaced by John Flannery, the head of GE healthcare, who said he will conduct a swift review of the business portfolio. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Under Armour (UAA.N), which rose 5.8 percent, while the largest decliner was Netflix (NFLX.O), down 4.2 percent. Coherus BioSciences (CHRS.O) tumbled 23.8 percent to $15.73 after the FDA denied the approval of its biosimilar for Amgen's (AMGN.O) Neulasta. Amgen edged up 0.5 percent to $164.88.

Paulo newspaper said on Monday. Temer's main political advisory group backs the idea, which would reduce the highest income tax bracket to as low as 18 percent from 27.5 percent, Estado reported, without saying how it got the information. Temer's press office said in an emailed response that the government had not yet made a decision on the matter. A member of Temer's cabinet, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, told Reuters the economic team was unlikely to back a lower tax threshold due to its fiscal cost. The government would tax dividends in order to fund eventual revenue losses stemming from the income tax reduction, the report said. Those eligible for Brazil's top social assistance program Bolsa Familia would get a 4.5 percent hike in stipends - above annual inflation readings. The report adds to growing concerns that Temer may ease budget spending controls to assert himself in power after corruption allegations against him by members of a billionaire business family. Based on testimony from a member of Brazil's Batista family, prosecutors said Temer worked to obstruct justice by condoning efforts to pay for the silence of a potential witness. Temer's political advisors remain undecided whether the tax income proposal will be presented to Congress in an executive decree or through an allied lawmaker, Estado said.

By Lucy Nicholson LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Many California tech companies are encouraging employees to bring their dogs to the office, saying their presence can boost productivity, relieve stress and improve the work environment. In Los Angeles' seaside tech hub, an area that encompasses parts of Santa Monica and Venice Beach and is dubbed  Silicon Beach,  the majority of companies are dog-friendly. At GumGum, a Santa Monica internet tech firm specializing in artificial intelligence, for instance, dogs are most welcome because of the calming effect they have on employees, said the company's chief executive, Ophir Tanz. Indy, Tanzâs American Eskimo dog, usually greets employees when they arrive at the office and dog treats and snacks are always up for grabs.  I think this could be a high stress, very high-paced environment,  Tanz, 35, said.  It just kind of takes the edge off.  But it doesn't take the edge off for all employees. Kyle Fresques, 27, sits at his desk with his dog at the GumGum office in Santa Monica, California, U.S., June 1, 2017. Picture taken June 1, 2017.Lucy Nicholson I have what could be described as a fragile relationship with dogs,  said Nicole Hirschman, a senior director of marketing at GumGum.  I'm not always sure how to interact with them, especially dogs that are hyper,  Hirschman said, adding that her company has accommodated that fear by providing sections of the office that are more isolated from dogs. Slideshow (7 Images)GumGum's pet policy is open only to dogs but could be expanded to include cats and other animals in the future, Tanz said, acknowledging that some companies trying to grant dogs access to their offices may face restrictions.  We spent more time probably negotiating the dog component of our lease with the landlord than anything else,  Tanz said.  But I do think that it is a practice that will become more popular.   Tradesy, an online fashion marketplace where women can resell their clothes and accessories, also pushes for the presence of dogs in the workplace, adorned by a large portrait of a French Bulldog. Dogs of various breeds sit in on meetings, curl up on couches, nuzzle under desks, sit on desks and get belly rubs. Some owners have their dogs on their laps while they are seated at their desk. Tradesy Chief Executive Officer Tracy DiNunzio said such integration of dogs is a win for employees and their employers.   Our employees like being able to bring their dogs to work and it benefits our business,  said DiNunzio, 38.  Our employees work longer hours because they've got their furry friends here.

The lawsuit seeks to force Missouri, and as a result to pressure other states, to enact stricter measures to guard against the over-medication of children in state custody. Filed by Children's Rights and the National Center for Youth Law in U.S. District Court in Jefferson City, it is the first statewide federal suit to take sole aim at the issue, attorneys said. They are seeking class-action status for the suit.  Giving a pill to sedate the child or older person is a quicker and easier response than training caregivers and staff (to provide) non-pharmacological, safer and in many instances more effective treatment,  said Bill Grimm, an attorney with the National Center for Youth Law. Jennifer Tidball, acting director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, and Tim Decker, director of the department's Children's Division, the two agencies named in the suit, declined to comment through a spokeswoman. The lawsuit, also filed by the St. Louis University Legal Clinic, said the children's constitutional right to be free from harm while in state custody was violated. It seeks a court to order authorities to ensure drugs are safely administered, that medical records are maintained and prescriptions reviewed, and that the children's informed consent is obtained and documented. While such drugs can be a helpful part of therapy, poor oversight means some children with behavioral issues rooted in abuse or neglect are given the drugs as  chemical straight-jackets  to control behavior, the lawsuit said. Some 30 percent of children in state care in Missouri are prescribed psychotropic medications, including anti-psychotics such as Abilify and Risperdal, as well as anti-depressants and mood stabilizers, the lawsuit said. That is almost twice the national rate, it said. Side effects of such drugs can include sleepiness, nervous tics and suicidal thoughts. Poor coordination means medical records often do not immediately accompany foster children when they move from one placement to another, the lawsuit said.  These children are being prescribed too many powerful and potentially dangerous drugs, at unacceptable dosages and at too young an age,  said Sara Bartosz, a Children's Rights attorney. Some states, including Florida, Texas, California, New York and Illinois, have taken steps such as requiring court authorization for psychotropic prescriptions.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/missouri-lawsuit-foster-idUSL1N1J90Z8"},

At the Sunday meeting, the company's board adopted a series of recommendations from the law firm of former U.S Attorney General Eric Holder following a sprawling, multi-month investigation into Uber's culture and practices, according to a board representative.

The recommendations in Holder's firm's report place greater controls on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Kalanick have had a surprising amount of autonomy for a company with more than 12,000 employees, sources familiar with the matter said. Kalanick and two allies on the board have voting control of the company.

An island-wide referendum on Sunday favored statehood in a 97 percent landslide, though voter turnout reached just 23 percent as opponents of Governor Ricardo Rossello's push to become a state boycotted the vote. The non-binding plebiscite is not expected to sway the U.S. Congress, which would have to agree to make Puerto Rico a state. Currently a U.S. territory, the island is struggling with $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, and is not viewed as a priority in Washington. Rossello, who campaigned on a push for statehood, said in a telephone interview with Reuters that he will go to the U.S. capital this week to urge federal lawmakers to begin the process of admitting Puerto Rico into the union.  We will make sure this becomes an issue,  Rossello said. The vote comes at a critical time for Puerto Rico, whose hazy status - which dates to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain - has contributed to its ongoing economic crisis. Last month, the island filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Its woes make statehood even more urgent, Rossello said.  Statehood brings stability, allows us to have fewer rule-changes from Congress, provides resources to our people,  he said. Divided Island Sunday's referendum, which cost Puerto Rico between $5 million and $7 million, according to government estimates, was the island's fifth since 1967 - and the third in which pro-statehood sentiments triumphed, though none have moved Congress to act.  If the U.S. is going to go to Venezuela and Cuba and Afghanistan and push democracy abroad, theyâve got to do the same  with their own territories, he said. But Puerto Ricans are skeptical the island's status will change.  This has all been a waste of time,  said taxi driver Felix Salasarar, 54, adding that federal lawmakers will  look at the voter turnout and say, 'where's the will of the people?'  Working against the governor may be a perception in Washington that Sunday's vote was not fair. The U.S. Department of Justice in April called on Rossello to change ballot language that initially did not give voters an option to remain a U.S. territory. Rossello told Reuters he made that decision because the territory option - which Rossello equates to colonialism - already lost in a previous status referendum, in 2012, making this year's vote a choice between statehood and independence. The Justice department viewed the language as politically unfair to millions of Puerto Ricans who favor territory status, prompting Rossello to add the territory option. But the Justice department never reviewed or approved the new language. To be sure, Sunday's results do not reflect the true nature of Puerto Ricans' views on statehood, which are fairly evenly divided between those who favor it and those who do not, based upon historical election results. Statehooder Rossello, for example, won his own election with just 42 percent of the vote. But that, the governor said, is how democracy works:  Everybody knows that those who go through the voting process have a louder voice than those who don't,  he said. Carolina Santos, a single working mother struggling to make her mortgage payments, said bankrupt Puerto Rico has more important things to worry about than a status vote.  Maybe we should focus more on fixing our financial problems and our schools,  she said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-vote-idUSL1N1J91I2"},

Kuczynski said during a conference in Madrid that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro should let humanitarian aid enter his oil-producing but economically ailing country. Dozens of people have been killed in protests against Maduro's socialist government since April.  If nothing is done, we are going to end up with a sea full of blood,  said Kuczynski, a former banker who has taken the lead among Latin American leaders in criticizing Maduro. He warned of the threat of massive immigration to Colombia, and said desperate refugees might even try to get to the Caribbean island of Curacao, risking a replay of the deadly Mediterranean journeys of refugees from Syria and Iraq.  We have to avoid that. If Latin America has any solidarity among countries, we have to try to find a solution,  Kuczynski  said, according to a statement from his office in Lima. Venezuela has lost many regional allies as several Latin American countries have moved to the right in recent years. Human rights groups have criticized the Venezuelan government's response to the protests, saying its  excessive use of force  and militarization have escalated the violence. Venezuelan officials say the world is turning a blind eye to opposition brutality including shootings of security officials and recruitment of underage protesters.

By Lucy Nicholson LOS ANGELES, June 12 (Reuters) - Many California tech companies are encouraging employees to bring their dogs to the office, saying their presence can boost productivity, relieve stress and improve the work environment. In Los Angeles' seaside tech hub, an area that encompasses parts of Santa Monica and Venice Beach and is dubbed  Silicon Beach,  the majority of companies are dog-friendly. At GumGum, a Santa Monica internet tech firm specializing in artificial intelligence, for instance, dogs are most welcome because of the calming effect they have on employees, said the company's chief executive, Ophir Tanz. Indy, Tanzâs American Eskimo dog, usually greets employees when they arrive at the office and dog treats and snacks are always up for grabs.  I think this could be a high stress, very high-paced environment,  Tanz, 35, said.  It just kind of takes the edge off.  But it doesn't take the edge off for all employees.  I have what could be described as a fragile relationship with dogs,  said Nicole Hirschman, a senior director of marketing at GumGum.  I'm not always sure how to interact with them, especially dogs that are hyper,  Hirschman said, adding that her company has accommodated that fear by providing sections of the office that are more isolated from dogs. GumGum's pet policy is open only to dogs but could be expanded to include cats and other animals in the future, Tanz said, acknowledging that some companies trying to grant dogs access to their offices may face restrictions.  We spent more time probably negotiating the dog component of our lease with the landlord than anything else,  Tanz said.  But I do think that it is a practice that will become more popular.  Tradesy, an online fashion marketplace where women can resell their clothes and accessories, also pushes for the presence of dogs in the workplace, adorned by a large portrait of a French Bulldog. Dogs of various breeds sit in on meetings, curl up on couches, nuzzle under desks, sit on desks and get belly rubs. Some owners have their dogs on their laps while they are seated at their desk. Tradesy Chief Executive Officer Tracy DiNunzio said such integration of dogs is a win for employees and their employers.  Our employees like being able to bring their dogs to work and it benefits our business,  said DiNunzio, 38.  Our employees work longer hours because they've got their furry friends here.

The ride-sharing service also faces a mass exodus of senior executives, a toxic culture about to be laid bare and a business model based on inventing the future, all of which increase the degree of difficulty. Thus far, Kalanick has made the most of being the next abrasive and industrious Silicon Valley founder. Uberâs valuation rocketed to $68 billion as his firmâs casual disregard for legal niceties upended the car-for-hire industry. Claims of rampant sexism, regulatory backlash, lawsuits and internal turmoil, however, have forced the board of directors to take the sort of closer look often reserved for a publicly traded entity. The notoriously prickly Steve Jobs accomplished the rare feat of reviving a faltering technology company, but he also was a rare commodity. Despite Uber's impressive achievements, it's not obvious the 40-year-old Kalanick can manage the same feat. His right-hand man has just decamped, and the firm's president, chief financial officer and heads of maps, artificial intelligence and self-driving also recently left or are leaving. Being private will block only some of the glare. An investigation into the companyâs culture by the former U.S. attorney general is now complete. A lengthy Sunday board meeting to discuss it suggests the findings aren't pretty. Unsavory revelations could revive a movement among consumers to delete the app from their phones.Â And Kalanick, whose mother was recently killed and father was seriously injured in a boating accident, may take a temporary step back. Uberâs inflated valuation is a big problem, too. It generated $20 billion of gross bookings last year. That's an estimated one-fifth of the global taxi and limousine market, implying future growth in this area will slow. Taking a bigger cut would risk alienating drivers and emboldening rivals. Investors are counting on cash-burning Uber to expand in logistics and to blaze a trail in self-driving vehicles, where competitors include formidable companies such as Alphabet. Skepticism about the worth of Uberâs equity might make it hard to hire top talent, from engineers to executives. Retention also could become an even bigger problem. Even to get Uber headed in the right direction would be a massive achievement.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The lawsuit seeks to force Missouri, and as a result to pressure other states, to enact stricter measures to guard against the over-medication of children in state custody. Filed by Children's Rights and the National Center for Youth Law in U.S. District Court in Jefferson City, it is the first statewide federal suit to take sole aim at the issue, attorneys said. They are seeking class-action status for the suit.  Giving a pill to sedate the child or older person is a quicker and easier response than training caregivers and staff (to provide) non-pharmacological, safer and in many instances more effective treatment,  said Bill Grimm, an attorney with the National Center for Youth Law. Jennifer Tidball, acting director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, and Tim Decker, director of the department's Children's Division, the two agencies named in the suit, declined to comment through a spokeswoman. The lawsuit, also filed by the St. Louis University Legal Clinic, said the children's constitutional right to be free from harm while in state custody was violated. It seeks a court to order authorities to ensure drugs are safely administered, that medical records are maintained and prescriptions reviewed, and that the children's informed consent is obtained and documented. While such drugs can be a helpful part of therapy, poor oversight means some children with behavioral issues rooted in abuse or neglect are given the drugs as  chemical straight-jackets  to control behavior, the lawsuit said. Some 30 percent of children in state care in Missouri are prescribed psychotropic medications, including anti-psychotics such as Abilify and Risperdal, as well as anti-depressants and mood stabilizers, the lawsuit said. That is almost twice the national rate, it said. Side effects of such drugs can include sleepiness, nervous tics and suicidal thoughts.  Poor coordination means medical records often do not immediately accompany foster children when they move from one placement to another, the lawsuit said.  These children are being prescribed too many powerful and potentially dangerous drugs, at unacceptable dosages and at too young an age,  said Sara Bartosz, a Children's Rights attorney. Some states, including Florida, Texas, California, New York and Illinois, have taken steps such as requiring court authorization for psychotropic prescriptions.

TransDigm may have avoided sharing cost information with the government for parts for which it is the sole source supplier, Warren wrote in a letter dated May 19 to Acting Inspector General Glenn Fine at the U.S. Department of Defense. The company could have also  unreasonably raised prices  on many parts shortly after completing acquisitions of the companies that produce them, Warren's letter suggested.  (bit.ly/2sUQxO5) Cleveland, Ohio-based TransDigm gets about 30 percent of its sales from the defense industry. The company is already facing heat from U.S. Congressman Ro Khanna, who in March asked the Department of Defense for a probe into its business practices  for potential waste, fraud and abuse in the defense industrial base . TransDigm has also been targeted by short-seller Citron Research, which issued a critical report in January suggesting that the company was vulnerable to pricing pressure as President Trump pressured defense contractors Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), two of TransDigm's major customers, to reduce costs. However, some analysts refuted Citron's arguments and attributed TransDigm's strong margins mainly to its substantial exposure to the aerospace aftermarket and meaningful contributions from acquisitions.

By Lucy Nicholson LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Many California tech companies are encouraging employees to bring their dogs to the office, saying their presence can boost productivity, relieve stress and improve the work environment. In Los Angeles' seaside tech hub, an area that encompasses parts of Santa Monica and Venice Beach and is dubbed  Silicon Beach,  the majority of companies are dog-friendly. At GumGum, a Santa Monica internet tech firm specializing in artificial intelligence, for instance, dogs are most welcome because of the calming effect they have on employees, said the company's chief executive, Ophir Tanz. Indy, Tanzâs American Eskimo dog, usually greets employees when they arrive at the office and dog treats and snacks are always up for grabs.  I think this could be a high stress, very high-paced environment,  Tanz, 35, said.  It just kind of takes the edge off.  But it doesn't take the edge off for all employees. Kyle Fresques, 27, sits at his desk with his dog at the GumGum office in Santa Monica, California, U.S., June 1, 2017. Picture taken June 1, 2017.Lucy Nicholson I have what could be described as a fragile relationship with dogs,  said Nicole Hirschman, a senior director of marketing at GumGum.  I'm not always sure how to interact with them, especially dogs that are hyper,  Hirschman said, adding that her company has accommodated that fear by providing sections of the office that are more isolated from dogs. Slideshow (7 Images)GumGum's pet policy is open only to dogs but could be expanded to include cats and other animals in the future, Tanz said, acknowledging that some companies trying to grant dogs access to their offices may face restrictions.  We spent more time probably negotiating the dog component of our lease with the landlord than anything else,  Tanz said.  But I do think that it is a practice that will become more popular.   Tradesy, an online fashion marketplace where women can resell their clothes and accessories, also pushes for the presence of dogs in the workplace, adorned by a large portrait of a French Bulldog. Dogs of various breeds sit in on meetings, curl up on couches, nuzzle under desks, sit on desks and get belly rubs. Some owners have their dogs on their laps while they are seated at their desk. Tradesy Chief Executive Officer Tracy DiNunzio said such integration of dogs is a win for employees and their employers.   Our employees like being able to bring their dogs to work and it benefits our business,  said DiNunzio, 38.  Our employees work longer hours because they've got their furry friends here.

President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, both Republicans, suggested in their proposed budget last month to increase federal funding for charter schools, which are public schools that are run independently from local districts, typically by a corporation.  We have a huge opportunity to score major funding increases for our movement,  said National Alliance for Public Charter Schools President Nina Rees at an annual meeting.  But if you don't speak up now, we may never have as good a chance to make a difference for our students.  More than three million children across the country attend charter schools, Rees said. The budget also proposed increasing money for other  school choice  programs, primarily giving families vouchers to pay private school tuition. The overall education budget would be cut by $9 billion under the Trump administration's plan, which Congress must still approve. The two major teacher unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, have said the budget would slash public school funding to free up money for private initiatives. Democrats have supported charter schools in the past, but now are nervous about associating themselves with Trump policies, Rees said. Republicans have long wanted to pursue ideas different from the traditional state schools. Rees told the meeting that some Republicans could give charter schools a lower priority than other issues on their legislative agenda.   All of us need to understand that accepting the presidentâs support for charter schools doesn't tie us to his whole agenda,  Rees said. Last week, DeVos faced hostile questions from a U.S. Senate committee about her voucher ideas, with her mostly responding that she was only exploring the possibility of a program. Past Republican proposals would provide  vouchers  via tax credits for parents. Supporters say vouchers could give children in neighborhoods with weak public schools the chance to receive a better education at local private institutions. Critics say vouchers are intended to boost private-sector profits with public money, and that the suggested subsidy amounts are too low to make tuition affordable for the poorest parents.

The numbers revealed just after 11 p.m. were 32, 26, 20, 38 and 58, with a Powerball 3. Lottery officials said one ticket, purchased in Sun City, California, matched all the numbers for the grand prize. The lump sum payout for the winning ticket would be $279.1 million.  The grand prize in the multi-state U.S. lottery soared to its highest in months after 19 straight drawings failed to produce a winner.

California is one of 44 states, plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, that participate in Powerball. Saturday's estimated $447.8-million jackpot, the seventh largest in Powerball history, beat out the $435.3 million won by a ticket buyer in Indiana in a Feb. 22 drawing, after a late surge in ticket buying.

Honeywell said in May it would decide by this fall whether to separate the business, its biggest with $14.75 billion in 2016 sales, which makes auxiliary power units and engines for aircraft.  The business has actually performed pretty well,  said Cote in an interview on the sidelines of the International Economic Forum of the Americas in Montreal.   And if you take a look at margin improvement and you take a look at the wins that we've had over a long period of time since 2013. We've invested very heavily in that business.      Hedge fund investor Third Point LLC has argued in favor of  the spinoff, which it said could create more than $20 billion in shareholder value. Cote said Honeywell Chief Executive Darius Adamczyk was reviewing the unit with the company's board and discussions would be held with investors at some point.  I can promise you that whatever Darius does, it's going to be consistent with 'how do you keep growing that overall return for our shareholders,'  he said. Cote, Honeywell's former CEO, also said that while he would have preferred that the United States not leave the 2015 global Paris agreement to fight climate change, he did not believe the move was  catastrophic.   While the decision would erode the ability of the United States to influence other countries, it will not stop America from achieving its own emissions reductions goals, in part because of the conversion from coal to natural gas use for power generation, he said. Cote also said he believed it was worth modernizing and updating the North American Free Trade Agreement to include technological developments.   Twenty years ago when they were negotiating NAFTA the whole idea of cyber was not all that big a deal,  he said.  It's very different today.

Honeywell said in May it would decide by this fall whether to separate the business, its biggest with $14.75 billion in 2016 sales, which makes auxiliary power units and engines for aircraft.  The business has actually performed pretty well,  said Cote in an interview on the sidelines of the International Economic Forum of the Americas in Montreal.   And if you take a look at margin improvement and you take a look at the wins that we've had over a long period of time since 2013. We've invested very heavily in that business.      Hedge fund investor Third Point LLC has argued in favor of  the spinoff, which it said could create more than $20 billion in shareholder value. Cote said Honeywell Chief Executive Darius Adamczyk was reviewing the unit with the company's board and discussions would be held with investors at some point.  I can promise you that whatever Darius does, it's going to be consistent with 'how do you keep growing that overall return for our shareholders,'  he said. Cote, Honeywell's former CEO, also said that while he would have preferred that the United States not leave the 2015 global Paris agreement to fight climate change, he did not believe the move was  catastrophic.   While the decision would erode the ability of the United States to influence other countries, it will not stop America from achieving its own emissions reductions goals, in part because of the conversion from coal to natural gas use for power generation, he said. Cote also said he believed it was worth modernizing and updating the North American Free Trade Agreement to include technological developments.   Twenty years ago when they were negotiating NAFTA the whole idea of cyber was not all that big a deal,  he said.  It's very different today.

New York Federal Reserve data released earlier on Monday showed inflation expectations fell to multi-month lows in May, reinforcing concerns that domestic price growth would fall short of the U.S. central bank's 2 percent goal for a longer period than previously thought. Prospects the Fed might not slow its pace of interest rate increases also weighed on the inflation outlook and reduced the appeal of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) for investors.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  used narrow grounds to reject the Trump administration's bid to undo a Hawaii federal judge's decision blocking the temporary ban. It said the Republican president's March 6 order violated existing immigration law. But the three-judge panel - all Democratic appointees - did not address whether it was unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims. A second court, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld a Maryland judge's ruling that also blocked Trump's 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  The 4th Circuit had ruled that the ban, which replaced an earlier Jan. 27 one also blocked by the courts,  drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination  aimed at Muslims. The 9th Circuit largely left in place a nationwide injunction by Judge Derrick Watson that stopped parts of the order, which Trump said was urgently needed to prevent terrorism in the United States. That ruling came in a lawsuit challenging the order brought by the state of Hawaii, which stated the ban would harm its universities and tourism industry. Even before Monday's ruling, the case was on the fast track to the Supreme Court, where the administration on June 1 filed an emergency request seeking to reinstate the order and hear its appeal of the 4th Circuit ruling. The Supreme Court could act on the administration's request as soon as this week. Trump has been on the losing side in all four court rulings on the March order. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration is reviewing Monday's decision and expressed continued confidence that the order is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the Supreme Court.  I think we can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence,  Spicer told a briefing. The 9th Circuit upheld the block on Trump's three-month travel ban for the six countries and four-month suspension of all refugee admissions. But the court pared back part of Watson's injunction in order to allow the government to conduct internal reviews on vetting procedures for these travelers. The administration said the travel ban was needed to allow time to implement stronger vetting measures, although it has already rolled out some new requirements not blocked by courts, including additional questions for visa applicants. Rather than focusing on Trump campaign statements as the Virginia-based court did, the 9th Circuit said the language in the executive order itself did not make a rational case for why a travel ban was needed. FILE PHOTO - International travelers arrive at Logan airport following U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order travel ban in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. February 3, 2017.Brian Snyder The order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality,  the court wrote, referring the combined populations of the six countries.  'Attractive Way' Under immigration law, the administration was required to make findings that entry of the people in question would be detrimental to the United States but failed to do so, the court said. Stephen Vladeck, a professor at University of Texas School of Law, said the 9th Circuit provided an easier path for the Supreme Court to keep the travel ban on hold, because it avoided entirely the controversy over Trump's campaign statements.   It provides a very attractive way to leave the injunction in place without setting broader doctrinal rules about which they may have pause,  Vladeck said. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  Monday was the deadline for the ban's challengers to respond to the administration's request that the order be allowed to go into effect. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents people challenging the ban in the separate Maryland suit handled by the 4th Circuit, filed court papers urging the court not to take up the case, saying the order will become moot on Wednesday, 90 days from when Trump issued it. Lawyers for Hawaii called the order a  thinly veiled Muslim ban.  Trump's earlier Jan. 27 order also included Iraq among the countries targeted and a total ban on refugees from Syria. The March order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but was blocked before it could go into effect on March 16. The suits by Hawaii and the Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution's First Amendment that prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. Hawaii's court papers mentioned a series of Trump Twitter posts on June 5. Trump described the order as a  watered down, politically correct  version of his original one.

Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, will cut crude allocations to Asia in July to a total of about 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), deeper than in June, sources told Reuters. One source said volumes to the United States would be cut by about 35 percent in July.  Data from market intelligence firm Genscape estimating a draw of more than 1.8 million barrels at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for U.S. crude futures last week added to the bullish sentiment, said traders who saw the data. Brent crude futures LCOc1 ended the session up 14 cents, or 0.3 percent at $48.29 a barrel, having risen as much as 2 percent to a session high of $49.15. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 gained 25 cents, or 0.6 percent, to settle at $46.08, having peaked at $46.71. Prices plunged about 5 percent last week after data from the U.S. Department of Energy showed a surprise increase in stockpiles.   We think the market's negative reaction to a one-week counter-seasonal crude inventory build of 3.3 million barrels was excessive, at least relative to its lack of positive reaction to draws amounting to 10.9 million barrels in the previous two weeks of data,  Standard Chartered analysts said in a note.  We do not expect a repeat of the inventory increase this week; rather we see a further large inventory draw.     Some traders and analysts said the rise looked technical in nature, after WTI rallied and encouraged a similar move in the Brent market. But they said the move might prove fleeting.  When you start to approach $45 a barrel in WTI, you're in an area where you do find some price support and I think there has been some evidence last week of investment flows coming back into crude oil,  Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.  You have to be careful not to be too optimistic for now,  he said.  Physical differentials are still under pressure and the time structure is still under pressure in Brent. It's a bit premature to call for much higher oil prices.  Traders also noted the price rise came as data showed speculative traders had increased their investment in crude futures by taking on large volumes of long positions.  Oil bulls have reset for a technical bounce,  said Stephen Schork, author of the Schork Report. While financial traders have confidence in rising prices, the physical market remains under pressure, especially because of an increase in U.S. drilling and output.  The combination of a rebound in OPEC and Russian output in the first half of 2018 and growing U.S. production will probably push the market back into oversupply next year after being in a large deficit in the second half of 2017,  Capital Economics said in a note.   As a result, it now seems more likely than not that oil prices will fall back a little next year, even with continued growth in demand, rather than slowly rising as we had previously assumed. As such, we are lowering our end-2018 forecast for Brent from $65 per barrel to $55.

With British politics thrust into the deepest turmoil since last June's shock Brexit vote, EU leaders were left wondering how the divorce talks would open next week. Despite her party's expectations of a landslide victory, May lost her majority in parliament, pushing her into rushed talks on a support agreement with a small eurosceptic Northern Irish Protestant party with 10 parliamentary seats. May faced Conservative party lawmakers at a meeting of its 1922 Committee. Despite anger at the election, she was cheered briefly at the start of the meeting.  She said 'I'm the person who got us into this mess and I'm the one who is going to get us out of it,'  said one Conservative lawmaker who attended.  She said she will serve us as long as we want her.  Lawmakers, who are by tradition not named at such meetings, told Reuters that there were no dissenting voices and that the party had no appetite for a leadership election. May appeared contrite, sought to apologize for her failed election gamble and gave an explanation of what went wrong. While some members of her party have said she will have to go eventually, May is expected to stay on as prime minister at least for now. May has promised to start the formal Brexit talks next week but her authority has collapsed since the election result and  opponents took her woes as a chance to push back against her Brexit strategy. During the campaign, May cast herself as the only leader competent enough to navigate the tortuous Brexit negotiations that will shape the future of the United Kingdom and its $2.5 trillion economy. At the meeting with lawmakers in Parliament, May recognized that a broader consensus needed to be built for Brexit and made clear that she would listen to all wings of the party on the issue. She mocked Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a socialist, as incompetent and unrealistic, but his electoral campaign energized the youth vote and wiped out the Conservatives' majority in parliament.

May's Brexit?  Her spokesman insisted her position on Brexit remained unchanged but Scottish Conservatives were pushing for her to move the focus onto economic growth and away from immigration, sources in the Scottish branch of the party said. EU talks might not begin on June 19 as expected, Brexit minister David Davis said and the Queen's Speech, due on the same day in which the government traditionally spells out its policy plans, has also been delayed, the BBC reported. May wants to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU before Britain leaves in March 2019, followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of the divorce. But her election failure means she must now go into Britain's most complex negotiations since World War Two with her eye firmly on the different factions within her Conservative Party, which has been divided over EU membership for a generation. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband Phillip arrive at church in Sonning, Britain June 11, 2017.Stefan WermuthOpponents of a sharp break include Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives. who helped the party win 12 more seats in Scotland in contrast to losses elsewhere. She has called for a closer relationship with the EU after Brexit.  There can be changes in the offer of Brexit as we go forward,  Davidson told reporters in London after meeting May.  What's clear is that there is going to be a real imperative on the economic impact of Brexit, to make sure that Brexit works for the whole country, to make that we're able to pursue free trade,  Davidson said.[L8N1J923P] May's spokesman said it remained government policy to cut net migration to under 100,000 and Brexit Minister David Davis also said walking away without securing a deal with the remaining 27 EU states remained a possibility. While Britons voted by 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in last year's referendum, Scots strongly backed staying in the bloc and  Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister in Scotland's devolved assembly, said a so-called Hard Brexit was  dead in the water . Ratings agency Moody's and Irish Prime Minister-designate Leo Varadkar also said the election made the opportunity of a  Soft Brexit  more likely, but Davis downplayed the chances of Britain staying in the single market. Prime Minister May?  Before the government can do anything it must finalize a deal with the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). May is due to meet its leader Arlene Foster on Tuesday.  In an article in the Belfast Telegraph, Foster listed three priorities, including getting Northern Ireland's devolved power-sharing government at Stormont working again.  We stood on a clear policy platform of wanting to strengthen the Union, of working for a good deal for Northern Ireland as the United Kingdom leaves the EU, and of promising to do our best to get Stormont up and running again for the benefit of all,  Foster wrote.  We will use the position we find ourselves in to do as we promised.  Davis, who said that some policies in the government's program would now be pruned back, was one of a number of senior Conservatives to publicly pledge loyalty to May. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is touted as the favorite to replace May should she be forced out, called on colleagues to rally behind her. However, George Osborne, a former finance minister who is now editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper and a vocal critic of May, said she appeared a  dead woman walking . Britain's descent into political crisis just days before the Brexit talks begin has sapped confidence amongst business leaders and infuriated bosses who were already grappling with the fallout from the vote to leave the EU.  The uncertainty has hit business confidence, according to a survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD). It found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence from its last survey in May. The pound slid to its lowest level for nearly two months after the vote, but the fall was much less severe than the one sparked by the Brexit vote in June 2016. On Monday, the currency was under pressure once again.    The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,  said a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100, speaking on condition of anonymity.   That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election. That has really profound implications for multinational businesses that have made a long-term bet on London being the sensible place to base themselves.

The prime minister was described as  contrite  at a meeting of Conservative members called the 1922 Committee, apologizing to those politicians who lost their seats in an election she did not need to hold and promising to clear up  the mess  she made on Thursday by working more widely with her party. For some who attended, it was a performance strong enough to convince doubters over her future.  Her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, described it on Twitter as a:  Stonking performance by the PM at 1922. One team going forward together for the UK.  But it was also one they wished she had deployed more during the seven-week election campaign, when her double-digit lead in the polls collapsed as she was widely mocked as a  Maybot  for sticking doggedly to an agreed script. Several Conservative lawmakers, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting, said she started off at the meeting by saying she had got the party into  this mess and I'm the one who is going to get us out of it.'   Once she'd made that confession - that mea culpa 'I'm taking responsibility' - the room really warmed up,  said another lawmaker who attended the meeting of the committee, named after a meeting in 1922 when the Conservatives withdrew from a coalition government.   We're all hugely proud, fond and respectful of her as a person.  With cheers, laughter and the sound of fists thumping tables heard in the corridor outside the Gladstone Room in parliament overlooking the Thames, her pledge to  serve us as long as we want her  was met with a 'yes', at least for now. The more than hour-long meeting was the latest test for the 60-year-old prime minister whose uncharacteristic gamble to strengthen her leadership by calling an early election left her authority in tatters and weakened her hand in Brexit talks. Her two closest aides have resigned, any plans for a wide reshuffle of her top ministers were put firmly aside and she will most probably have to rein in her reform program, now dependent on a small Northern Irish party for support. And while at least one Conservative lawmaker left the meeting suggesting that not all was well by shouting  what do you expect, some kind of communal love in?  when asked how the meeting was going, others seemed satisfied that May had bought herself more time at the helm of the party, and country. She seemed to settle nerves among eurosceptics and pro-EU lawmakers about her strategy for Britain's departure from the European Union and eased concerns about a tie-up with the Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which some feared could press on social issues such as abortion and gay rights.  But it was her words about the party which won many over. She spoke about being  a servant of the party since she was 12-years-old  when she started stuffing envelopes with Conservative Party promotional material, a lawmaker said. Another said:  I just wished we had seen more of it during the campaign.

(Reuters) - A Montana Republican congressman-elect pleaded guilty on Monday to assaulting a reporter and was ordered to perform community service and receive anger management training. Greg Gianforte, a wealthy former technology executive who campaigned on his support for President Donald Trump, attacked a reporter on May 24, the day before he won a special election to fill Montana's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Gallatin County Judge Rick West sentenced Gianforte to 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management classes. The judge in Bozeman, Montana, also handed down a six-month deferred jail sentence, allowing Gianforte to avoid time behind bars if he complies with the court's orders. Ben Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of The Guardian newspaper, said Gianforte  body-slammed  him, breaking his eyeglasses, when the reporter posed a question about healthcare during a campaign event in Bozeman. The altercation has been portrayed as a sign of the toxicity that has infused American politics. Critics of Trump say his strident criticism of the media has encouraged violence against journalists, while some of the president's supporters say reporters in general are unfair in their coverage. An attorney for Gianforte and his spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. Last week Gianforte apologized to Jacobs in a letter, and he sent a $50,000 check to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In court, Jacobs said he accepted Gianforte's apology.  I am confident that he will be a strong advocate for a free press and the First Amendment,  he said.  And I even hope to be able to finally interview him once he has arrived on Capitol Hill.  Gianforte apologized to Jacobs again in court and said he looked forward to meeting with him later. The judge left open the possibility that Gianforte, after completing his sentence, could have the misdemeanor assault charge formally dismissed, Gallatin County Prosecutor Marty Lambert said by phone. Gianforte initially sought to plead no contest, instead of guilty, but the prosecutor said he insisted on a guilty plea.  This is the type of case where a defendant just needs to admit to the court what he did, to plead guilty, and he did that,  Lambert said. Gianforte on May 25 defeated Democrat Rob Quist to fill the House seat vacated when Trump appointed Ryan Zinke as interior secretary.

Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, will cut crude allocations to Asia in July to a total of about 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), deeper than in June, sources told Reuters. One source said volumes to the United States would be cut by about 35 percent in July.  Data from market intelligence firm Genscape estimating a draw of more than 1.8 million barrels at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for U.S. crude futures last week added to the bullish sentiment, said traders who saw the data. Brent crude futures LCOc1 ended the session up 14 cents, or 0.3 percent at $48.29 a barrel, having risen as much as 2 percent to a session high of $49.15. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 gained 25 cents, or 0.6 percent, to settle at $46.08, having peaked at $46.71. Prices plunged about 5 percent last week after data from the U.S. Department of Energy showed a surprise increase in stockpiles.   We think the market's negative reaction to a one-week counter-seasonal crude inventory build of 3.3 million barrels was excessive, at least relative to its lack of positive reaction to draws amounting to 10.9 million barrels in the previous two weeks of data,  Standard Chartered analysts said in a note.  We do not expect a repeat of the inventory increase this week; rather we see a further large inventory draw.     Some traders and analysts said the rise looked technical in nature, after WTI rallied and encouraged a similar move in the Brent market. But they said the move might prove fleeting.  When you start to approach $45 a barrel in WTI, you're in an area where you do find some price support and I think there has been some evidence last week of investment flows coming back into crude oil,  Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.  You have to be careful not to be too optimistic for now,  he said.  Physical differentials are still under pressure and the time structure is still under pressure in Brent. It's a bit premature to call for much higher oil prices.  Traders also noted the price rise came as data showed speculative traders had increased their investment in crude futures by taking on large volumes of long positions.  Oil bulls have reset for a technical bounce,  said Stephen Schork, author of the Schork Report. While financial traders have confidence in rising prices, the physical market remains under pressure, especially because of an increase in U.S. drilling and output.  The combination of a rebound in OPEC and Russian output in the first half of 2018 and growing U.S. production will probably push the market back into oversupply next year after being in a large deficit in the second half of 2017,  Capital Economics said in a note.   As a result, it now seems more likely than not that oil prices will fall back a little next year, even with continued growth in demand, rather than slowly rising as we had previously assumed. As such, we are lowering our end-2018 forecast for Brent from $65 per barrel to $55.

Treasury yields fell after the U.S. Treasury Department sold $24 billion in three-year government debt to the strongest bidding in about 1-1/2 years, according to Treasury data.     Three-year yields hit a session low of 1.478 percent, while 10-year yields hit a session low of 2.187 percent after the auction. U.S. two-year yields had touched 1.359 percent, their highest in a month, while three-year yields touched their highest since May 24 at 1.500 percent, ahead of the auction.      Yields resumed their rise, however, after the Treasury sold $20 billion of 10-year government notes to average demand at a yield of 2.195 percent. That yield was higher than expected and indicated more tepid appetite than that for the three-year supply.      There may be a little reluctance to buy the 10-year at these prices,  said David Coard, head of fixed income sales and trading at Williams Capital Group in New York, in reference to the lukewarm demand.      The Treasury will sell $12 billion in 30-year bonds on Tuesday.      Caution restrained the move higher in yields as traders awaited the Fed's two-day meeting beginning on Tuesday. While an interest rate increase from the Fed is widely expected, the central bank's forecasts for future rate hikes and hints of potential balance sheet reduction are uncertain and will be closely watched.      Wednesdayâs meeting is pretty much a high-risk event,  said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasuries trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York.     Analysts said the Fed could take the hawkish stance of hinting it could taper its balance sheet later this year while also hiking rates again in December. Conversely, a more dovish stance is also seen as possible, in part due to recent signs of softening inflation.     Benchmark 10-year Treasuries were last down 3/32 in price to yield 2.211 percent, from a yield of 2.199 percent late on Friday.

The finance minister of the world's richest country per capita played down the economic toll of the confrontation, and said the government was  extremely comfortable  with its financial position, with the resources to endure the pressure. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar a week ago, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. The biggest diplomatic rift in years among the rich states of the Gulf has disrupted Qatar's imports of food and other materials and caused some foreign banks to scale back business. On Monday, it was becoming clear that Qatar could keep the economic damage from becoming critical. Some of its food factories were working extra shifts to process imports from nations outside the Gulf, such as Brazil. Shipping lines have re-routed container traffic via Oman instead of the UAE. Such measures may involve delays and raise costs for Qatar; on Monday Fitch put Qatar's AA credit rating on Rating Watch Negative, saying a sustained crisis could hurt its credit outlook. But they are unlikely to prevent the economy from functioning in any fundamental way, economists say. The diplomatic confrontation has become a major test for the United States, which is closely allied to the countries on both sides. Qatar hosts the Middle East headquarters for U.S. air forces; Bahrain hosts the main base for the U.S. Navy. As the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas, Qatar's wealth has allowed it to crown its small Gulf peninsula with skyscrapers. It has also given the government the means to take an outsized role in regional affairs, sponsoring factions in revolts and civil wars and brokering peace deals across the Middle East. Several neighbours have been furious for years.  Starve the Beast  In Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump, who has strongly backed the countries imposing sanctions on Qatar despite a more neutral stance taken by the State Department and Pentagon, said the measures were helping to stop terrorism funding.  One of the big things that we did and you are seeing it now is Qatar and all of the things that are actually going on in a very positive fashion. We are stopping the funding of terrorism,  he said during a photo call with cabinet officials.  We are going to starve the beast.â Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference in France that Qatar  still had no clue  why the nations cut ties. He denied that Qatar supported groups like the Muslim Brotherhood that its neighbours oppose, or had warm ties with their enemy Iran. So far, the measures do not seem to have caused a serious shortages of supplies in shops. Some people have even joked about being  blockaded  inside the world's richest country: a Twitter page called  Doha under siege  pokes fun at the prospect of readying  escape yachts , stocking up on caviar and trading Rolex watches for espresso. But an economic downturn could have more dire consequences for the vast majority of Qatar's 2.7 million residents, who are not citizens but foreign workers. Migrant labourers make up 90 percent of Qatar's population, mostly unskilled and dependent on construction projects such as building stadiums for the 2022 soccer World Cup. In an interview with CNBC television -- one of the first public appearances by a Qatari economic policy maker since the crisis erupted -- Finance Minister Ali Sherif al-Emadi said the government was  extremely comfortable with our positions, our investments and liquidity in our systems . The energy sector and economy are essentially operating as normal and no serious impact has been felt on supplies of food or other goods. Qatar can import goods from Turkey, the Far East or Europe and will respond to the crisis by diversifying its economy even more, he told CNBC.  Our reserves and investment funds are more than 250 percent of gross domestic product, so I don't think there is any reason that people need to be concerned about what's happening or any speculation on the Qatari riyal.  Jason Tuvey, a Middle East economist at London-based Capital Economics, said that as long as the other Gulf countries did not interfere with Qatar's gas exports, the tiny state should be able to carry on without a serious recession.  It seems Qatar would be able to weather quite a prolonged period of sanctions,  he said, adding that economic growth, fuelled by government spending and infrastructure projects, was  highly unlikely to grind to halt . Qatar, like other Gulf states, has tried to diversify from oil and gas. The sanctions have hurt one of its highest-profile enterprises, fast-growing airline Qatar Airways, which says it has been cut it off from 18 of its destinations.  It is actually a travesty of civilised behaviour to close airline offices. Airlines offices are not political arms,  CEO Akbar Al Baker told CNN.  We were sealed as if it was a criminal organisation. We were not allowed to give refunds to our passengers.  He added that he was  extremely disappointed  in Trump. Washington  should be the leader trying to break this blockade and not sitting and watching what's going on and putting fuel on (the) fire.  Underpinned by Wealth Fund Qatar's riyal currency, pegged at 3.64 to the U.S. dollar, was under pressure last week as banks reacted nervously to the diplomatic rift. On Monday, the currency came off last week's lows in the spot and offshore forwards markets. Bankers said the central bank, which has $34.5 billion of net foreign reserves backed by an estimated hundreds of billions of dollars of assets in Doha's sovereign wealth fund, was supplying enough dollars to keep exchange rates under control. The cost of insuring Qatar's sovereign debt against default fell back for the first time in a week. Yields on Doha's international bonds dropped almost 10 basis points and the stock market stabilised after sliding 8.7 percent in the past week. Tuvey said the main threat to the economy was that Qatari banks could find it much harder to obtain wholesale funding from other banks to sustain growth in their loan portfolios. However, if the situation becomes critical, the Qatari government can liquidate some of its overseas assets to fund its banks, as Saudi Arabia did last year when its banks faced a squeeze. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund has major stakes in top Western companies such as Credit Suisse. Asked by CNBC whether it might now sell some of those stakes to raise money, Emadi indicated this was not on the cards for now. Qatar's normally bustling border with Saudi Arabia was deserted on Monday. Soldiers in an armoured pick-up truck looked out over barbed-wire at sprawling dustland separating Qatar from Saudi Arabia. Indian migrants who work at the border in green uniforms lay on inspection platforms sheltering from the sun. Normally, thousands of passengers and hundreds of trucks from Saudi Arabia pass through the crossing each day, bringing fruit and vegetables, as well as construction materials.

The decision made public on Monday by U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan ends seven years of litigation over a practice that the plaintiffs' lawyers said was unconstitutional and disproportionately harmed minorities. Summonses had typically been issued for minor offenses, such as disorderly conduct and drinking alcohol in public, as part of a  broken windows  approach to policing quality-of-life concerns that the New York Police Department adopted in the 1990s. The NYPD agreed in the settlement to reaffirm that quotas for summonses, arrests and stops violated department policy. Summons filings in the city's criminal court fell every year from 2010, when the lawsuit began, to 2015, city data show.  It took a landmark-type of settlement to correct what had been a pervasive problem,  Stephen Neuwirth, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan representing the plaintiffs, said in an interview. Nick Paolucci, a spokesman for the city's law department, said:  The parties will move forward to execute the agreement.  The settlement covers roughly 900,000 NYPD summonses issued from May 2007 to December 2015, and later dismissed essentially because officers lacked probable cause. It sets aside $56.5 million for claimants, with a maximum of $150 per incident, with unclaimed funds reverting to the city. Another $18.5 million will go to the plaintiffs' law firms: Quinn Emanuel; Cohen & Fitch, and the office of Jon Norinsberg. In granting final approval, Sweet said the settlement advanced the public policy toward enforcing civil rights laws. He overruled objections that the accord was too small and released too many claims.  This civil rights class action is the paradigm of change and progress achievable in a society undergirded by the rule of law,  the judge wrote.  The rights of all citizens will be fortified through what has been represented as the largest settlement of Fourth Amendment claims in New York City history.  The U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment protects people against unreasonable searches and seizures. Joshua Fitch, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview that the litigation has led to better policing and greater NYPD communication with the public.  It shifts the department's perspective from 'broken windows' and statistics, to a focus on communities and fighting crime,  he said.

BakerÂ on Monday agreed that class action plaintiffs cannot engineer appellate review of a decision denying class certification by dismissing their individual claims. But the justices split on why â and a concurrence by three conservatives could signal renewed interest in the critical class action issue of constitutional standing for uninjured class members.  Plaintiffs' lawyers in the Baker case attempted a bit of procedural hocus pocus. In 2012, a federal district judge in Seattle struck classwide design defect claims by Microsoft Xbox users who contended the console scratched game disks inserted into it. The named plaintiffs asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review the trial court ruling, which had the same effect as a decision denying class certification. When the 9th Circuit rejected the interlocutory appeal, the plaintiffs dismissed their individual claims in the trial court and returned to the 9th Circuit.  This time, they argued they had an automatic right to appeal the final decision dismissing their case â but they asked the 9th Circuit only to review the ruling that struck their classwide claims, not their voluntary dismissal of individual claims. The 9th Circuit agreed it had jurisdiction over the appeal and revived the class claims for reconsideration by the trial court.  The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, held the 9th Circuit did not have jurisdiction under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which limit the automatic right of review to cases shut down by a final ruling. To allow plaintiffs to circumvent the âdeath-knellâ doctrine, Justice Ginsburg wrote, âwould erode the finality principle and disserve its objectives,â resulting in âprotracted litigation and piecemeal appeals.â  The federal rules strike a careful balance in permitting discretionary appellate review of intermediate trial-court orders, Justice Ginsburg wrote. The court, she said, cannot countenance a procedural end-run that would give class action plaintiffs a unilateral right to obtain appellate review of rulings they donât like.  Justice Ginsburg was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito agreed with the majorityâs judgment but not its reasoning. (Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the decision.)  In a concurrence written by Justice Thomas and joined by Roberts and Alito, the conservative justices argued that the named plaintiffs in the Microsoft case lost their constitutional right to sue when they dismissed their individual claims. Under Article III, Justice Thomas wrote, federal courts can only resolve âreal and substantial controversiesâ presenting specific, resolvable issues.  âThe plaintiffsâ appeal from their voluntary dismissal did not satisfy this jurisdictional requirement,â the concurrence said. âWhen the plaintiffs asked the district court to dismiss their claims, they consented to the judgment against them and disavowed any right to relief from Microsoft. The parties thus were no longer adverse to each other on any claims, and the Court of Appeals could not âaffect their rightsâ in any legally cognizable manner.â  That might seem to be an extremely narrow point, but Justice Thomas went on to explain that class action plaintiffs canât pursue classwide claims unless they have individual standing. âThe plaintiffs contend that their interest in reversing the order striking their class allegations is sufficient to satisfy Article IIIâs case-or-controversy requirement, but they misunderstand the status of putative class actions,â the concurrence said. âClass allegations, without an underlying individual claim, do not give rise to a âcaseâ or âcontroversy.â Those allegations are simply the means of invoking a procedural mechanism that enables a plaintiff to litigate his individual claims on behalf of a class. Thus, because the Court of Appeals lacked Article III jurisdiction to adjudicate the individual claims, it could not hear the plaintiffsâ appeal of the order striking their class allegations.â  Mayer Brownâs Class Defense BlogÂ hypothesized on Twitter that Justice Thomas was getting at a long-running class action question the Supreme Court has danced around but never answered directly: Can a class be certified if it includes class members who donât meet constitutional standing requirements?  As you probably recall, when Tyson Foods took a wage-and-hour case to the Supreme Court in 2015, it argued that the jury verdict for workers at an Iowa meat-packing plant would reward employees who werenât actually injured by the companyâs overtime policies. Tyson first argued that classes cannot be certified if the class definition sweeps in uninjured class members. It subsequently modified its position a bit, asserting that plaintiffs must provide a reasonable mechanism for culling uninjured class members.  The Supreme Court decidedÂ the Tyson case on other grounds, but in a concurrence, the chief justice emphasized that class action plaintiffs have to meet constitutional standing requirements. âArticle III does not give federal courts the power to order relief to any uninjured plaintiff, class action or not,â he wrote.  The Supreme Court has not revisited the predicament of uninjured class members since the Tyson case, despite invitationsÂ to do so. That could be because of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Courtâs biggest class action skeptic, or because of the long delay in filling his seat. As Iâve written, itâs not clear whether Justice Scaliaâs replacement, Justice Gorsuch, has as hearty an appetite for class action issues as his predecessor.  But the Thomas concurrence shows at least three justices are still thinking about the standing of uninjured class members, just as plaintiffs in a case that raises the issue are about to file a response to a petition for Supreme Court reviewÂ by Conagra Brands. If Justice Gorsuch sides with Roberts, Thomas and Alito, the court will confound conventional wisdom and take the Conagra case.  I reached out to Peter Stris of Stris & Maher, whose firm represented the plaintiffs suing Microsoft at the Supreme Court. Via a Twitter direct message, Stris agreed that the majority opinion avoided addressing the constitutional right of class members to pursue classwide claims when theyâve dropped individual claims. (He also said - no surprise â that he disagrees with the concurrenceâs standing analysis.) Stris said that by ducking on standing and focusing instead on finality, the Supreme Court has made it harder for defendants, as well as plaintiffs, to pursue once-and-for-all appeals on class certification.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-standing-idUSKBN1932DV"},

The change in tone for the central bank, which said earlier this year rate cuts remained on the table, sent the Canadian dollar to its strongest level against the greenback since April 18. In the bank's most upbeat comments on the economy, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said first-quarter growth was  pretty impressive,  while there were encouraging signs growth was broadening.  As growth continues and, ideally, broadens further, Governing Council will be assessing whether all of the considerable monetary policy stimulus presently in place is still required,  Wilkins told a business audience. Wilkins said Canada had largely adjusted to a drop in oil prices  that prompted the bank to cut rates twice in 2015, to 0.50 percent, to bolster the economy, which slipped into a brief recession. The speech's hawkish tone is the first acknowledgement from the bank that the next move is likely to be a hike, said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. The bank makes its next rate decision on July 12. While many economists had expected the bank to start raising in 2018, markets were pricing in a 52 percent chance of a hike by the end of 2017 following Wilkins' speech.  It looks as though the bank is looking to shift gears,  said Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.  There's a decent chance that if things go right over the next few months, rate hikes could be coming sooner than everybody thought.  Wilkins acknowledged tax and trade policies in the United States will likely remain an important uncertainty in the bank's outlook and it will be difficult to gauge the impact without more information. She added,  life goes on and decisions must be made in the meantime.  Even if only a few sectors were expanding enough to absorb excess capacity, the bank would need to take the appropriate monetary policy action to meet its 2 percent inflation target, she said. Inflation is currently at 1.6 percent, thanks in part to slack in the economy, Wilkins said. She noted other indicators also point to ongoing spare capacity, including only moderate growth in wages.

PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - The Minnesota police officer charged with fatally shooting a black motorist during a traffic stop last year, the aftermath of which was streamed on social media by the driver's girlfriend, was not justified in firing his gun, prosecutors said on Monday. St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez was charged with second-degree manslaughter after he fatally shot Philando Castile, 32, last July in an incident that drew national attention and led to weeks of protests in St. Paul and Minneapolis.  Being nervous is not a reason to shoot and kill somebody,  federal prosecutor Jeffrey Paulsen said during his closing remarks in the Ramsey County District Court in St. Paul. Paulsen is assisting the Ramsey County attorney's office on the case. Two of the seven shots fired by Yanez missed Castile and almost hit the girlfriend in the passenger seat, Diamond Reynolds, and her four-year-old daughter in the back seat, Paulsen said. Castile was courteous, non-threatening and kept his hands in view while Yanez spoke to him, Paulsen said. The jury will begin deliberations on Monday afternoon. The shooting in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights, like similar incidents across the United States, fueled public debate about appropriate use of force by law enforcement against unarmed African-Americans and other racial or ethnic minorities. Yanez's attorney, Earl Gray, said in closing statements that his client is an honest police officer who  did what he had to do.   Officer Yanez's actions were justified,  Gray said.  The state has failed miserably to present its case.  According to Gray, Castile did not follow Yanez's orders because he was high on marijuana. During the trial, Reynolds said she and Castile had used marijuana, and a subsequent autopsy found traces of the drug in his blood. Yanez, who pleaded not guilty, testified on Friday that Castile disregarded the officer's commands and began reaching for a firearm he had disclosed he had in his possession. Yanez also said he was scared for his life.  The police video of the traffic stop and Reynolds' Facebook Live post were played in the courtroom last week. Reynolds said she showed the video because she did not trust police. Yanez said he was justified in stopping Castile's car because he resembled a suspect in a convenience store robbery, court documents said. Castile's vehicle also had a broken brake light. After Castile was stopped, Yanez asked him to present his driver's license and insurance card. Castile disclosed he was carrying a handgun. A gun permit was later found in his wallet.

The operator of Gymboree, Janie and Jack and Crazy 8 stores joins a growing list of specialty retailers and department stores that have closed thousands of locations or filed for bankruptcy this year as consumers shift toward online shopping. James Mesterharm, Gymboree's chief restructuring officer, said in a court filing the company was hurt by lower-cost competition from rival brick-and-mortar chains Children's Place and The Gap Inc, which have less debt financing. Gymboree's lenders agreed to provide a $35 million loan to finance the company's operations and will invest $80 million into the company when it emerges from bankruptcy, according to Mesterharm.  We expect to move through this process quickly and emerge as a stronger organization that is better positioned in todayâs evolving retail landscape,  said Daniel Griesemer, the chief executive officer of Gymboree, in a statement. San Francisco-based Gymboree opened its first store in 1986 in California and expanded rapidly, going public in 1993. Bain Capital Private Equity took the company private for $1.8 billion in 2010. Bain launched a global expansion aimed at overtaking rivals such as Carter's and GapKids, but Mesterharm said the chain failed to achieve the levels of growth it had anticipated. The company estimated it had $755.5 million in assets and $1.37 billion in debt, according to court records. Gymboree said 35 percent of its 1,300 stores are leased from GGP Inc and Simon Property Group Inc. The stores tend to be located in malls, where declining traffic has taken its toll on specialty retailers and large department store anchor tenants. In the past year, Sears Holdings Corp and Macy's Inc have closed scores of department stores, while chains such as The Limited Stores, The Wet Seal and shoe retailer Payless Holdings have filed for bankruptcy. Credit rating agency Moody's said last week it expects the ranks of distressed retailers will continue to grow over the next 18 months. It said 15 percent of the retailers tracked by the agency are now rated at the lowest end of the credit spectrum. Gymboree is represented by the Kirkland & Ellis law firm, and filed its bankruptcy in Richmond, Virginia.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/gymboree-bankruptcy-idUSL1N1J91D7"},

The decision made public on Monday by U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan ends seven years of litigation over a practice that the plaintiffs' lawyers said was unconstitutional and disproportionately harmed minorities. Summonses had typically been issued for minor offenses, such as disorderly conduct and drinking alcohol in public, as part of a  broken windows  approach to policing quality-of-life concerns that the New York Police Department adopted in the 1990s. The NYPD agreed in the settlement to reaffirm that quotas for summonses, arrests and stops violated department policy. Summons filings in the city's criminal court fell every year from 2010, when the lawsuit began, to 2015, city data show.  It took a landmark-type of settlement to correct what had been a pervasive problem,  Stephen Neuwirth, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan representing the plaintiffs, said in an interview. Nick Paolucci, a spokesman for the city's law department, said:  The parties will move forward to execute the agreement.  The settlement covers roughly 900,000 NYPD summonses issued from May 2007 to December 2015, and later dismissed essentially because officers lacked probable cause. It sets aside $56.5 million for claimants, with a maximum of $150 per incident, with unclaimed funds reverting to the city. Another $18.5 million will go to the plaintiffs' law firms: Quinn Emanuel; Cohen & Fitch, and the office of Jon Norinsberg. In granting final approval, Sweet said the settlement advanced the public policy toward enforcing civil rights laws. He overruled objections that the accord was too small and released too many claims.  This civil rights class action is the paradigm of change and progress achievable in a society undergirded by the rule of law,  the judge wrote.  The rights of all citizens will be fortified through what has been represented as the largest settlement of Fourth Amendment claims in New York City history.  The U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment protects people against unreasonable searches and seizures.   Joshua Fitch, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview that the litigation has led to better policing and greater NYPD communication with the public.  It shifts the department's perspective from 'broken windows' and statistics, to a focus on communities and fighting crime,  he said.

Maybe a more appealing vegetable","keywords":"Bradley Turnwald,Margo Denke,Vandana Sheth,US,HEALTH,VEGETABLES,NAME,APPEAL,Living / Lifestyle,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Psychology,Corporate Events,Interest Rates / Policy,Economic Events,General News,Diet and Nutrition,Public Health,Science,Healthcare (TRBC),United States","sector":"Life","content":"(Reuters Health) - People may be more likely to pile vegetables on their plates when these dishes are served up with seductive names like âsweet sizzlinâ green beans and crispy shallotsâ than when theyâre peddled as health foods, a recent experiment suggests.  For the study, a team of researchers at Stanford University in California experimented with randomly naming identical vegetable dishes in one of four ways: a basic description with plain names, a label stressing a lack of unhealthy components like sugar or fat, a tag identifying positive health properties like lots of vitamins or antioxidants or an indulgent moniker designed to make the dish sound delicious and intriguing like âdynamite chili and tangy lime seasoned beets.â During weekday lunches in a university cafeteria, researchers watched how many people chose the dishes depending on how the dishes were described and then weighed how much food people put on their plates. Compared with basic labels, indulgent descriptions got 25 percent more people to select the vegetable dishes and also resulted in a 23 percent gain in the total weight of vegetables piled onto plates.  âOur results suggest that emphasizing health in descriptions of healthy foods may not be an effective approach for motivating most diners to choose healthy options, and that a better approach may be to emphasize the indulgent, tasty components of the food,â said lead study author Bradley Turnwald, a psychology researcher at Stanford.  âThis means that we may be able to help fight the obesity epidemic and the problematic mindset that healthy foods are not tasty by changing the way that we label and talk about healthy foods,â Turnwald said by email.  Researchers did their experiment at a cafeteria that serves an average of 607 lunches on a typical weekday and ran their experiment over a total 46 days.  During the study period, 8,279 diners, or about 30 percent, selected the vegetable dish. The rest skipped the veggies no matter what they were called.  While the indulgent labels like âslow-roasted caramelized zucchini bitesâ lured the most diners, basic descriptions that only named the vegetables like zucchini were the second most popular option followed by labels touting positive health benefits, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.  The least appealing choice for diners were dishes with healthy labels describing negative attributes that were missing, like cholesterol or sugar or fat.  One limitation of the study is that researchers didnât examine how much of the food on their plates people actually ate.  And itâs unclear if people would be drawn to dishes by their labels a second time, noted Dr. Margo Denke, a former researcher at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. âFor instance, poorly cooked zucchini bites might be pushed onto the poor consumer once with fun language, but if they taste bad - are undercooked and not flavorful or overcooked and slimy - the consumer will steer clear of this choice on the next go âround,â Denke, who wasnât involved in the study, said by email.  For many consumers, thereâs a perception that healthy food is boring and plain, and exciting labels might get some people to try things they might not otherwise eat, said Vandana Sheth, a private practice dietician and nutritionist in Los Angeles and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. âUsing descriptive words to highlight the flavor profile as well as positive health benefits can encourage people to enjoy more healthy food options,â Sheth, who wasnât involved in the study, said by email. âParents, caregivers, and consumers can certainly use this concept to encourage families to enjoy eating healthfully.â SOURCE: bit.ly/2tdSN2u JAMA Internal Medicine, online June 12, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-vegetables-name-appeal-idUSKBN1932C4"},

The initial public offering (IPO) is set to be one of Europe's largest bank listings since the 2008 financial crisis and the proceeds could extend to 3.8 billion euros if the over-allotment option is exercised fully. With a price range between 3.90 euros and 4.90 euros, the deal is targeting a similar valuation to that of Bank of Ireland , the state's largest bank by assets. A source close to the deal said the range was based on a price to book value multiple of between 0.82 and 1.03. Bank of Ireland trades at a multiple of 0.9. The Finance Ministry said the long-awaited stake sale remains on track despite the Conservative party losing its majority in Thursday's UK election. Finance Minister Michael Noonan had previously said the price could be driven up if the party, which still won the most seats, secured a convincing majority.  Market conditions remain favourable and I am encouraged by the strong level of interest shown by investors in the offering to date,  Noonan said in a statement. Dublin rescued the bank in a 21 billion euro taxpayer bailout that began in early 2009 and has been considering cashing out some of its 99.9 percent stake since last year. One of Ireland's two dominant banks alongside Bank of Ireland, AIB returned to profit three years ago and has since cut its huge stock of impaired loans by more than two thirds become the first domestically owned lender to restart dividends since the financial crisis. AIB will list its shares on the Irish and London stock exchanges and seek admission to the main markets of each. The government said the sale is expected to be one of the largest IPOs on the UK's main market in 20 years. AIB is less exposed to Britain's departure from the European Union than bigger rival Bank of Ireland, having made only 14 percent of last year's pre-provision operating profit in the UK. However, the IPO prospectus said that Brexit could result in an increase in the level of non-performing loans held by banks across Ireland, including AIB, while demand for new loans could decline. Ireland's substantial stock of non-performing loans, mostly extended for house purchases just before the bursting of Ireland's property bubble in 2008, amounts to 17.5 percent of total lending. At the end of 2016 AIB's 14.2 billion euros of non-performing loans accounted for 22 percent of its gross loan book. That compares with 9.6 percent at Bank of Ireland. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Davy and Deutsche Bank are global coordinators for the AIB offering.

Specifically the review shows that rather than designating an area encompassing almost 1.5 million acres as a national monument, it would have been more appropriate to identify and separate the areas that have significant objects to be protected to meet the purposes of the Act,  the document read. Zinke also recommended Native American tribes be allowed to co-manage  cultural areas  within the resized monument - a nod to tribes that had lobbied for protections for the territory - and that Congress review conservation policies in the area. The recommendations set the tone for the administration's broader review, triggered by an executive order in April. Trump had argued that previous administrations  abused  their right to designate national monuments under the U.S. Antiquities Act of 1906 and put millions of acres of land, mainly in western states, off limits to drilling, mining, logging and ranching without adequate input from locals. The review is likely to add fuel to a heated national debate over Washington's role in America's wildest spaces. Environmentalists and tribal groups support federal oversight, but many state political leaders, conservatives and industry groups say the lands should generate money for business, creating jobs, or yielding revenue for education and other public services. While the land encompassed by the Bears Ears monument is not believed to contain huge amounts of coal, oil or gas, several other monuments on Zinke's review list do - making the Bears Ears decision symbolically important to industry groups.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-interior-bearsears-idUSL1N1J909S"},

The regulator then publishes those disclosures on its Brokercheck website, allowing investors to search the backgrounds of individual investment advisors. But FINRA refuses to release that data in bulk form, which would allow for database analysis to find patterns at brokerages that might also trouble investors â such as a firmâs propensity to hire brokers with a history of client complaints or regulatory run-ins. Reuters obtained that bulk FINRA data from researchers at Columbia University Law School Datalab, who wrote code to extract it from FINRAâs Brokercheck website. To analyze it, reporters Benjamin Lesser and Elizabeth Dilts chose to analyze only 12 of the 23 required FINRA, isolating only those incidents that might cause investors the most concern. The reporters examined firms with at least 20 brokers, and FINRA-mandated disclosures between the years 2000 and 2015. They found 48 firms where at least 30 percent of brokers have such FINRA flags on their records. (For full coverage, see: here) The FINRA flags included regulatory sanctions, customer complaints that resulted in a payment, criminal cases that resulted in a plea agreement or conviction, and bankruptcies. The incidents analyzed by Reuters varied in severity. Some involve final legal determinations of misconduct, such as criminal convictions, civil judgments or regulatory fines. A very small percentage of those cases remained under appeal by the broker or firm involved, according to the FINRA data. The analysis also included incidents with no finding of misconduct, but that did come at a cost to the firm or employee involved - such as broker terminations after allegations of misconduct, or settlements in which firms paid restitution to customers but admitted no wrongdoing. Reuters used the data provided by Columbia Law School researchers to identify firms meeting the above criteria. Reporters then manually updated the data, using the Brokercheck site, to include FINRA-mandated disclosures by brokers at those firms through the beginning of 2017. Below are the definitions - written by FINRA - of the 12 incidents used in the Reuters analysis. *     Customer dispute - settled: A consumer-initiated, investment-related complaint, arbitration proceeding or civil suit containing allegations of sale practice violations against the broker that resulted in a monetary settlement to the customer. *     Customer dispute - award/judgment: A consumer-initiated, investment-related arbitration or civil suit containing allegations of sales practice violations against the broker that resulted in an arbitration award or civil judgment for the consumer. *     Regulatory - final: A final, formal proceeding initiated by a regulatory authority for a violation of investment-related rules or regulations. *     Judgment: An unsatisfied and outstanding judgment or lien against the broker. *     Employee separation after allegations: The broker voluntarily resigned, was discharged, or was permitted to resign after being accused of (1) violating investment-related statutes, rules, regulations or industry standards of conduct; (2) fraud or the wrongful taking of property; or (3) failure to supervise in connection with investment-related statutes, regulations, rules, or industry standards of conduct. *     Financial - final: Involves a bankruptcy, compromises with one or more creditors, or Securities Investor Protection Corporation liquidation involving the broker or an organization the broker controlled that occurred within the last 10 years. *     Criminal - final disposition: Involves a criminal charge against the broker that has resulted in a conviction or plea arrangement. *     Civil - final: Involves (1) an injunction issued by a court in connection with investment-related activity. (2) a finding by a court of a violation of any investment-related statute or regulation or (3) an action brought by a state or foreign financial regulatory authority that is dismissed by a court pursuant to a settlement agreement. *     Civil bond: Involves a civil bond for the broker that has been denied, paid or revoked by a bonding company.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-finra-brokers-methodology-idUSL1N1J91C6"},

McMahon and others at National Securities Corporation, for instance, bought or sold between 200 and 900 shares of Apple stock for Haus nine times in about a year - racking up $27,000 in fees, according to a 2015 complaint Haus filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Haus alerted the regulator to what he called improper âchurningâ of his account to harvest excessive fees. But the allegation could hardly have come as a surprise to FINRA, the industryâs self-regulating body, which is charged by Congress with protecting investors from unscrupulous brokers. FINRA has fined National at least 25 times since 2000. As of earlier this year,  35 percent of Nationalâs 714 brokers had a history of regulatory run-ins, legal disputes or personal financial difficulties that FINRA requires brokers to disclose to investors, according to a Reuters analysis of FINRA data. McMahon did not respond to requests for comment. National declined to comment. National is among 48 firms where at least 30 percent of brokers have such FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis, which examined only the 12 most serious incidents among the 23 that FINRA requires brokers to disclose. That compares to 9 percent of brokers industry-wide who have at least one of those 12 FINRA flags on their record. In total, the 48 firms oversee about 4,600 brokers and billions of dollars in investor funds. For a graphic with the complete list of firms and statistics on each, see: tmsnrt.rs/2rtbhOl FINRA officials acknowledged in interviews with Reuters that the longstanding hiring practices at certain firms are a threat to investors. But they also argued that they can do little to stop firms from hiring high concentrations of potentially problematic brokers because doing so is not illegal. That leaves investors like Haus vulnerable to a small group of brokerages that regularly hire advisors with blemishes on their backgrounds that would make them unemployable at most firms, former regulators and industry experts said. The dozen FINRA flags examined by Reuters include regulatory sanctions for misconduct, employment terminations after allegations of misconduct and payments by firms to settle customer complaints. They also include brokersâ personal financial troubles, such as bankruptcies or liens for nonpayment of debts. (For full coverage, including an explanation of Reuters methodology, see: here ) Last year, a FINRA official told Reuters, the regulator identified 90 firms as posing the highest risk to investors and flagged them internally for higher scrutiny. But FINRA declined to name the firms publicly or to release statistics showing the concentration of brokers with a history of FINRA flags within each firm. In an interview with Reuters, FINRAâs executive vice president of regulatory operations, Susan Axelrod, declined to comment on any specific firm identified by Reuters. She would not directly address why the regulator will not publicly name the firms it identified as high-risk. âLetâs just say those are not new names to us,â she said of the firms identified by Reuters. FINRA Chief Executive Robert Cook, however, addressed its unwillingness to name names in a speech on Monday morning in Washington at Georgetown University, according to prepared remarks released by FINRA. âWe must consider fairness and due process,â Cook said. âFINRA does not possess a crystal ball - someone who we may identify as a high-risk broker for oversight purposes is not necessarily a bad actor.â The regulator has created a dedicated unit focused on those high-risk firms, Axelrod told Reuters, but she declined to discuss its budget, staffing or specific duties. Cook on Monday said the unit included an unstated number of âexaminers and managersâ with experience dealing with high-risk brokers. FINRA makes data on individual brokersâ backgrounds available through its Brokercheck website, which Axelrod said provides âunparalleled transparencyâ to investors. That site allows the public to search histories of complaints and sanctions against individual brokers â but only one at a time. The regulator will not release the data in bulk form, such as a database, that would enable researchers to identify firms with high concentrations of brokers with a history of FINRA flags. Reuters analyzed the FINRA data after receiving it from researchers at Columbia University Law School DataLab, who wrote computer code to extract it from the regulatorâs website. Reuters sought comment from officials at all 48 firms. Some responded that many of the FINRA-mandated disclosures do not necessarily equate to misconduct by brokers, such as when a firm pays a client to settle a complaint without admitting wrongdoing. Cook, the FINRA chief, echoed that point in his speech Monday. âA broker who has an unpaid lien because of a debt accrued due to a medical issue in her family must disclose that lien,â he said. âThat event should not be treated the same as fraud or stealing money from customers.â At least one executive from a firm identified in the Reuters analysis serves on FINRAâs 24-member Board of Governors - Brian Kovack, president of Fort Lauderdale-based Kovack Securities Inc. Thirty-four percent of the firmâs 388 brokers have a history of FINRA flags, according to the Reuters analysis. In a statement, Brian Kovack attributed those figures to the firmâs decision to take on a large number of new brokers from another brokerage in 2014, which prevented the firm from using its usual vetting process for new employees. Asked why, three years later, the firm still has a high concentration of brokers with FINRA flags, Kovack said it took âconsiderableâ time to ensure the review of new brokersâ backgrounds was âfair and transparent.â After the review, the firm asked some advisors to leave, Kovack said, without specifying how many or the reasons they were dismissed. Self-Regulation FINRA is not a government agency, but rather an industry-financed âself-regulatory organizationâ - as FINRA puts it - that is not subject to public records laws and receives no taxpayer support. Its annual operating budget of about $1 billion - supporting about 3,500 staffers in 16 offices - comes primarily from dues paid by member firms and individual brokers. FINRA has the power to fine, suspend and ban firms and brokers, and it can refer potentially criminal cases to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Last year, in an unlikely collaboration, Senators Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, sent FINRA a letter demanding the regulator do more to stop broker misconduct and to prevent those with troubled histories from concentrating in the same firms. âFINRA is not doing nearly enough to fulfill its investor protection mission,â the letter read. The regulator responded with a letter on June 15 of last year saying that it closely oversees firms âto determine whether they present a heightened risk to investors.â From 2013 to mid-2016, the regulator told the senators, it identified 279 âhigh-riskâ brokers. After identifying them, the regulator permanently banned 238 brokers from the industry for subsequent violations. FINRA oversees about 3,800 brokerages and 630,000 brokers. In interviews with Reuters, Axelrod pointed to firms that FINRA expelled. The regulator shut down about 130 firms in the six years ending in January 2017, with many cited for securities fraud, misuse of funds or falsifying records. But the Reuters analysis of FINRA data found that the regulator did not expel the firmâs chief executive in 58 percent of those cases, leaving him or her free to join other brokerages. The brokers at those banned firms typically were also able to continue working in the industry. Axelrod said that FINRA gives extra scrutiny to former executives of expelled firms after they show up with new jobs at other firms. âOverwhelmingâ Evidence Regulators in at least one state think more can be done to crack down on brokers and brokerages with track records of violations. Massachusetts securities regulators are considering changing their licensing practices after completing a review last year of brokerages with a high proportion of brokers with troubled histories. âThe evidence is pretty overwhelming that there is a practice here - a history here - of people moving from one firm to another and re-offending,â Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin told Reuters. âWe canât simply stand by and say, âThe companies will do a better job.â They wonât do a better job unless they feel some incentive.â Some former regulators contacted by Reuters agreed with FINRAâs policy of withholding its internal risk ratings of firms from the public. Susan Merrill - former head of enforcement at FINRA and now a partner with the law firm Sidley Austin LLP - said that releasing such ratings would be unfair to firms who have not necessarily broken laws or regulations. âIf there is a finding by the regulator,â Merrill said, âthen thatâs fair game.â FINRAâs former CEO, Richard Ketchum, told Reuters last June that the regulator was considering publicly disclosing more information about firms with high concentrations of problematic brokers. âWe are looking hard at questions about how we can appropriately and fairly provide that broader disclosure ... when firms have concentrations of persons that have similar problems,â Ketchum said in an interview. Cook said Monday that FINRA was considering additional measures to rein in high-risk brokers, but he didnât go into specifics. Wolves of Wall Street Many of the 48 firms identified by Reuters regularly cold-call customers on the phone with high-pressure sales pitches, according to regulatory complaints and sanctions against the firms and their brokers. Long Island, New York, has historically been a haven for boiler-room brokerages, which inspired the movie, âThe Wolf of Wall Street,â based on the true story of broker Jordan Belfort and his firm, Stratton Oakmont. Belfort pleaded guilty to securities fraud and money laundering in 1999. FINRA warned in a news release last year that boiler-room tactics were on the rise, particularly those targeting the elderly and other vulnerable investors. Brokers generally know which firms will hire them despite past sanctions, said Dean Jeske, a lawyer at Foley & Lardner and FINRAâs former deputy regional chief counsel for enforcement in the Midwest. âWhen you get a mark on your (record), itâs hard to get a job at Morgan Stanley or Merrill Lynch,â Jeske said. Mike McMahon has had little trouble landing jobs at brokerages despite a trail of allegations and settlements. McMahon left National in 2014 and later joined a smaller firm, Long Island-based Worden Capital Management - where 43 percent of 79 brokers had a history of FINRA flags as of earlier this year. Forty-one percent of the firmâs brokers had at some point in their careers worked at firms that were later expelled by FINRA, according to the Reuters analysis. Jamie Worden, head of Worden Capital, said in a statement that his firmâs compliance team vets all prospective brokers and that FINRA-mandated disclosures do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. âThe public disclosures only represent a sliver of the information surrounding any circumstance,â Worden said. McMahon, National and another firm where he worked have agreed to pay a total of $1.35 million since 2007 to settle 10 separate client complaints involving McMahon, according to McMahonâs record on FINRAâs BrokerCheck website. In addition, McMahon currently faces four additional complaints to FINRA - which have yet to be resolved in a settlement or arbitration ruling - from clients he advised while working with National, the regulatorâs records show. McMahon denied any wrongdoing in several of the settled complaints. Haus - the customer who lost more than half a million dollars with McMahon and others at National - told Reuters that the ordeal made him contemplate suicide. âI was ashamed,â said the soybean farmer and U.S. military veteran. âI didnât want to tell anyone Iâm losing my life savings.â Haus settled his complaint against National in November for an undisclosed amount of money. The settlement required him to sign a nondisclosure agreement, and he has since not responded to Reutersâ inquiries. Hiring Opportunity In many cases, the firms identified by Reuters continue to operate after years of repeated run-ins with FINRA and other regulators. Take Los Angeles-based WestPark Capital Inc, where about half of the firmâs 95 brokers have FINRA flags on their records. More than 47 percent of WestPark brokers once worked at firms that were later expelled by FINRA. Regulators including FINRA and the New Jersey Bureau of Securities have sanctioned WestPark six times in the past 11 years for a variety of alleged violations. In 2004, FINRA suspended WestParkâs chief executive, Richard Rappaport, for 30 days from his management role and fined him and the firm $50,000 in response to allegations that WestPark omitted critical information from investment research reports and lacked supervisory controls. Without admitting wrongdoing, Rappaport agreed to the punishment in a settlement with FINRA. But he then ignored the suspension and continued to actively manage WestPark, according to FINRA disciplinary records reviewed by Reuters. His punishment for ignoring the 30-day suspension? Another 30-day suspension from FINRA and a $10,000 fine. In 2016, West Park saw a hiring opportunity. The firm started taking on dozens of brokers from Newport Coast Securities - a firm that FINRA banned from the industry that year for excessive trading in client accounts to rack up fees and for recommending unsuitable investments. Newport appealed the expulsion. By early 2017, WestPark had hired about 40 brokers from Newport Coast - including its former CEO, Richard Onesto. WestPark and Rappaport declined to comment. Onesto did not respond to requests for comment. Pump and Dump Another firm Reuters identified in its analysis - Windsor Street Capital - has been fined 12 times by FINRA since 2000 but may now face much stiffer penalties from the SEC. Fifty-eight percent of the firmâs 48 brokers had FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis. Over the years, FINRA fines have cost the firm about $300,000, and Windsor has appealed two other fines totaling more than $1 million. In January, the SEC brought administrative actions against Windsor Street Capital and its former anti-money laundering officer, John Telfer, for allegedly facilitating a $25 million pump-and-dump scheme - in which investors promote or âpumpâ the value of a dubious stock they own just before selling, or âdumpingâ it. Windsor declined to comment to Reuters but denied any misconduct in an SEC filing. The SEC alleges that Windsor allowed clients to sell hundreds of millions of unregistered penny stocks through Windsor brokerage accounts and did not report the suspicious transactions to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Windsor clients bought stock in dormant shell companies, spread false information to promote the companiesâ products and then dumped the shares as other investors bought in at inflated prices, the SEC alleges in a case that is still pending. Windsor made about $500,000 in commissions and fees from transactions related to the scheme, according to the SEC. When asked if FINRA investigators contributed to the SECâs investigation, an SEC official declined to comment and pointed to the agencyâs press release, which only credits SEC investigators. FINRA did not respond to requests for comment on whether it had a role in the Windsor investigation. âHappy New Year!â At Long Island-based Joseph Stone Capital, 71 percent of the firmsâ 59 brokers had FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis. Joseph Stone was investigated by the state of Montana after one of its sales representatives, Lawrence Sullivan, cold-called the office of Montanaâs Commissioner of Securities and Insurance to pitch an investment on January 15, 2016, according to a report on the incident by the regulator. The securities commission launched an investigation into the firm after the call, during which Sullivan quickly backtracked and denied he was pitching securities, according to the report. Reuters could not reach Sullivan for comment. The staffer he called - Patrick Navarro, an assistant analyst at the state regulator - did not respond to requests for comment. Investigators ultimately unearthed âfraudulent and unethicalâ practices, including excessive trading in client accounts - resulting in commissions totaling 28 percent of the $877,493 invested by clients in Montana, according to the regulatorâs report. The firm settled with the state on April 18, agreeing to pay $30,000 in restitution to clients without admitting wrongdoing. During the call that got the firm into trouble, Sullivan pitched Navarro on an investment in Paypal stock, the report said. After Navarro informed Sullivan that he worked for the stateâs securities regulator, Sullivan blurted out âHappy New Year!â and hung up.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-finra-brokers-idUSL1N1J91C3"},

The move illustrates how distressed debt hedge funds, which snapped up the bonds of oil and gas companies for pennies on the dollar during the energy price downturn now hold big stakes in companies that have exited bankruptcy and are seeking to sell as the sector slowly recovers.  The company said in March it was evaluating all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.  Talks with potential acquirers are under way, and a deal is not certain because of the company's high valuation expectations, the sources added. The persons asked not to be identified because the deal negotiations are confidential. Penn Virginia and Jefferies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Penn Virginia shares were down 1.7 percent at $42.81 on Monday afternoon after rising 6 percent earlier in the session. The company has a market capitalization of around $650 million. Houston-based Penn Virginia exited bankruptcy in September after wiping out $1.1 billion in debt. Its biggest shareholders now are hedge funds, including Strategic Value Partners LLC, Anchorage Capital Group LLC and Contrarian Capital Management LLC. Since the beginning of 2015, more than 200 oil and gas explorers and producers filed for bankruptcy, as energy prices hovered near historic lows. The Permian basin, which straddles Texas and New Mexico, has been a hot spot of deal activity, because its low production costs make it economical to drill there even when crude prices are depressed. The nearby Eagle Ford shale, where Penn Virginia has operations, has been less active, but some companies have still made deals there. Most notably, Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) earlier this year agreed to sell its assets in the field for $2.3 billion to a venture owned by Sanchez Energy Corp (SN.N) and Blackstone Group (BX.N). Companies that historically had more gas output have shifted to oil to take advantage of relatively higher prices. Penn Virginia's production is 71 percent oil, with the rest gas. It aims to shift production to 79 percent oil by the end of next year.

An island-wide referendum on Sunday favored statehood in a 97 percent landslide, though voter turnout reached just 23 percent as opponents of Governor Ricardo Rossello's push to become a state boycotted the vote. The non-binding plebiscite is not expected to sway the U.S. Congress, which would have to agree to make Puerto Rico a state. Currently a U.S. territory, the island is struggling with $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, and is not viewed as a priority in Washington.   Rossello, who campaigned on a push for statehood, said in a telephone interview with Reuters that he will go to the U.S. capital this week to urge federal lawmakers to begin the process of admitting Puerto Rico into the union.  We will make sure this becomes an issue,  Rossello said. The vote comes at a critical time for Puerto Rico, whose hazy status - which dates to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain - has contributed to its ongoing economic crisis. Last month, the island filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Its woes make statehood even more urgent, Rossello said.  Statehood brings stability, allows us to have fewer rule-changes from Congress, provides resources to our people,  he said.  Divided Island Sunday's referendum, which cost Puerto Rico between $5 million and $7 million, according to government estimates, was the island's fifth since 1967 - and the third in which pro-statehood sentiments triumphed, though none have moved Congress to act.  If the U.S. is going to go to Venezuela and Cuba and Afghanistan and push democracy abroad, theyâve got to do the same  with their own territories, he said.  But Puerto Ricans are skeptical the island's status will change.  This has all been a waste of time,  said taxi driver Felix Salasarar, 54, adding that federal lawmakers will  look at the voter turnout and say, 'where's the will of the people?'   Working against the governor may be a perception in Washington that Sunday's vote was not fair.  The U.S. Department of Justice in April called on Rossello to change ballot language that initially did not give voters an option to remain a U.S. territory.  Rossello told Reuters he made that decision because the territory option - which Rossello equates to colonialism - already lost in a previous status referendum, in 2012, making this year's vote a choice between statehood and independence.  The Justice department viewed the language as politically unfair to millions of Puerto Ricans who favor territory status, prompting Rossello to add the territory option. But the Justice department never reviewed or approved the new language. To be sure, Sunday's results do not reflect the true nature of Puerto Ricans' views on statehood, which are fairly evenly divided between those who favor it and those who do not, based upon historical election results. Statehooder Rossello, for example, won his own election with just 42 percent of the vote. But that, the governor said, is how democracy works:  Everybody knows that those who go through the voting process have a louder voice than those who don't,  he said. Carolina Santos, a single working mother struggling to make her mortgage payments, said bankrupt Puerto Rico has more important things to worry about than a status vote.  Maybe we should focus more on fixing our financial problems and our schools,  she said.

Lawyers for Honest and the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The accord was disclosed one week after Honest reached a $1.55 million settlement of a federal lawsuit in Los Angeles claiming it sold laundry detergent, dish soap and surface cleaners containing a skin irritant it had pledged to avoid. In the New York case, the plaintiff Brad Buonasera accused Honest of misleadingly marketing at least 41 items including bubble bath, children's toothpaste, floor cleaners, laundry detergent and soap. He contended that the products were labeled  natural,   all natural,   naturally derived,   plant-based  and  no harsh chemicals (ever!),  but actually contained  a spectacular array of synthetic and toxic ingredients.  Some of the ingredients or labels had been changed by the time the lawsuit was filed, Buonasera said. Honest has denied the claims in both lawsuits, and last week said it stood behind its products' safety and effectiveness. Alba was not named as a defendant. The case is Buonasera et al v.

Meanwhile, gold was little changed ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with analysts saying the U.S. central bank could take an aggressively hawkish posture of signaling a balance sheet reduction later this year and another interest rate increase in December.      Spot gold        was up 0.08 percent at $1,266.92 an ounce by 2:54 p.m. EDT (1854 GMT), having shed 1 percent on Friday in its biggest one-day percentage fall since May 18. U.S. gold futures         settled down 0.2 percent at $1,268.90.     Palladium        gained 0.3 percent to $893 an ounce after rising above $910 on Friday, its highest since 2001.      It seems to be speculators driving the price higher,  said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale, adding that there was a shortage of metal for immediate delivery.      That shortage has created a premium, or backwardation, of about $6 and $21 dollars an ounce for the June and July futures respectively over the August contract.             But analysts say declining car sales in China and the United States point to weaker demand for palladium.                   The palladium market is experiencing a short-squeeze, which we believe is driven by investment demand rather than industrial demand,  said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke.       Eventually, the weaker demand backdrop from automotive catalysts should be reflected in deteriorating sentiment and falling prices. We remain bearish.      NYMEX palladium stocks PA-STX-COMEX fell to a 14-year low of 42,450 ounces on Friday.      NYMEX palladium stocks have been falling since 2014, and remain at low levels ... this suggests reduced availability of 'last resort' stocks while speculative positioning is closing in on record highs,  said Standard Chartered in a note.       We forecast the palladium market to swing deeper into deficit this year, at 563,000 ounces, driven by continued growth in autocatalyst demand and lackluster supply.      Johnson Matthey         , a leading manufacturer of vehicle catalysts, forecast last month that the palladium market would show a deficit of 792,000 ounces in 2017.                  Overall, precious metals markets are waiting for the outcome of the Fed's meeting on Wednesday at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).     Higher rates, as expected by the market, could boost the dollar, making commodities priced in the greenback more expensive for holders of other currencies.                                    Silver        fell more than 1 percent to a 2-1/2-week low of $16.87 an ounce, while platinum        was up 1.2 percent at $945.

The move illustrates how distressed debt hedge funds, which snapped up the bonds of oil and gas companies for pennies on the dollar during the energy price downturn now hold big stakes in companies that have exited bankruptcy and are seeking to sell as the sector slowly recovers.  The company said in March it was evaluating all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.  Talks with potential acquirers are under way, and a deal is not certain because of the company's high valuation expectations, the sources added. The persons asked not to be identified because the deal negotiations are confidential. Penn Virginia and Jefferies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Penn Virginia shares were down 1.7 percent at $42.81 on Monday afternoon after rising 6 percent earlier in the session. The company has a market capitalization of around $650 million. Houston-based Penn Virginia exited bankruptcy in September after wiping out $1.1 billion in debt. Its biggest shareholders now are hedge funds, including Strategic Value Partners LLC, Anchorage Capital Group LLC and Contrarian Capital Management LLC. Since the beginning of 2015, more than 200 oil and gas explorers and producers filed for bankruptcy, as energy prices hovered near historic lows. The Permian basin, which straddles Texas and New Mexico, has been a hot spot of deal activity, because its low production costs make it economical to drill there even when crude prices are depressed. The nearby Eagle Ford shale, where Penn Virginia has operations, has been less active, but some companies have still made deals there. Most notably, Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) earlier this year agreed to sell its assets in the field for $2.3 billion to a venture owned by Sanchez Energy Corp (SN.N) and Blackstone Group (BX.N). Companies that historically had more gas output have shifted to oil to take advantage of relatively higher prices. Penn Virginia's production is 71 percent oil, with the rest gas. It aims to shift production to 79 percent oil by the end of next year.

A technology sector rout extended to its second trading day on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite on track for its biggest two-day loss since September. The tech selling dragged down all three major indexes, causing concerns of wider bearishness in equities.   We're having a hard time deciding whether it's really a tech-specific sell-off or if this is a valuation pullback, so we're just holding pat right now,  said Scott Goginsky, a co-portfolio manager of the Biondo Growth Fund.  However, investors took comfort that rather than totally abandoning equities, some were rotating into value sectors of the market. Losses were contained by a continuing rebound in energy and bank stocks.   The overall equity market health is reasonably good because people are rotating - they are not frantically getting out of stocks,  said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co.  Up nearly 14 percent since President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, the technology sector of the S&P; 500 .SPLRCT had ballooned to its most expensive since early 2008 in terms of price to earnings expectations. Tech took over the market leadership from financials and other sectors that outperformed after the Nov. 8 presidential election on hopes that Trump's agenda of deregulation and tax cuts would benefit the sector. The five largest U.S. companies by market capitalization, Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Facebook (FB.O) added more than $600 billion in market cap in 2017 before the sell-off started, making some analysts wary of sector over-extension. The Technology Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLK.P) was down 0.8 percent Monday after having fallen as much as 2.2 percent - on track to post its largest two-day percentage decline in nearly a year. The decline was led by Apple, stung by a broker downgrade for a second straight week on Monday.  Short sellers had already been building their position in Apple since the end of May, according to financial data firm S3, with short interest topping $9 billion for the first time since May of last year. Apple is now the third-largest worldwide short, behind Alibaba Group (BABA.N), with $16.7 billion of short interest, and Tesla Inc(TSLA.O), with $10.5 billion. The tech sell-off  is a reminder that markets that have full valuations are prone to quick reversals,  said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, which oversees more than $1.5 trillion in assets. The recent reversal in technology has given new life to the  value trade,  in which investors bet on large, undervalued companies and seek dividend payments. The iShares S&P; 500 value ETF (IVE.P) is up more than 4 percent over the last two sessions. The fund's top holdings include Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N). At the same time, the technology rout has left some investors finding opportunities to add to their tech holdings at lower prices.  We're not worried at all about tech. We just think itâs a correction and a dip,  said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates , in Reno, Nevada.  Guys like me are net buyers right nowâ¦ It'll be fine.

Following a cabinet meeting at Downing Street, Davidson expressed confidence that the shape of Brexit would differ after a national election in which Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May lost her overall parliamentary majority.  Davidson's Scottish Conservatives however gained 12 more lawmakers, giving her some clout on the direction of policy in the Westminster government.  The country has told us that they want us to be the government, behind the prime minister, but what they've said is that they want us to work with others - that's what not having a majority means,  Davidson said after the meeting ended.  But I do think there can be changes in the offer of Brexit as we go forward,  she said.  What's clear is that there is going to be a real imperative on the economic impact of Brexit.  Davidson is not a Westminster lawmaker but spearheaded her party's Scottish election campaign. She supports single market membership as part of any Brexit deal, a party source said.  She understands, however, it may not be possible to secure that as part of the Brexit negotiations, the source added. EU leaders have repeatedly said membership of the single market is linked inextricably with the freedom of movement principle which allows workers to move around the bloc freely. May is negotiating a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, a Northern Irish party with 10 seats, that would allow her to pass laws.  The shortfall has opened a debate about May's Brexit plans, which include leaving the EU's single market, striking a new customs deal and limiting immigration from Europe.  We must, in my view, seek to deliver an open Brexit, not a closed one, which puts our country's economic growth first,  Davidson told reporters on Friday.  May's approach to Brexit is unchanged by the election, her spokesman said on Monday. But one lawmaker said May recognized that a broader consensus needs to be built during Monday's meeting with Conservative members of parliament. Some senior ministers and lawmakers are also seeking a Brexit strategy that takes more account of the economic impact of limiting immigration.  What we have said is that we are going to deliver on the wishes of the British public and that was to retake control of borders and laws,  May's spokesman said.  The EU has been clear that you canât be in the single market and achieve those goals.  Separately, the minister representing Scotland in May's cabinet, David Mundell, said the final Brexit deal should be supported in Britain's parliament across the political divide.  I don't want to see the Brexit deal going through (Britain's national parliament) the House of Commons with a majority of one, I want to see it going through the House of Commons with support across parties,  Mundell told BBC Scotland. Speaking in London, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said supporters of a so-called hard Brexit have been left  dead in the water  by May's failure to secure a majority in last week's election. Sturgeon's Scottish National Party won 35 of Scotland's 59 seats in Britain's 650-seat parliament in the June 8 election.

The company asked a U.S. District Court judge in New York on June 7 to dismiss BP's April lawsuit alleging Monroe wrongfully severed the deal. The motion for dismissal has not been previously reported. BP was allowed to blend Eagle Ford crudes from different wells under its contract but only if each blend met specific API gravity and vapor pressure requirements. Blending lower-grade crude is an industry tactic used to boost returns on less desirable oil, said Monroe, which filed a motion to have the suit dismissed. BP said in its initial complaint that it blended batches of crude out of Texas's Eagle Ford shale play prior to delivery. The company said the two parties specifically discussed such blending before a three-year deal was signed in 2014. Monroe unilaterally ended the deal in June 2016.  Monroe Energy has breached the contract for delivered crude product in an apparent attempt to avoid paying the agreed-upon price for the crude BP supplies,  BP said in a written statement on Monday, adding that Monroe had accepted the product without complaint.

As a result of recent negotiations between the U.S. and Iraq, Iraq has recently agreed to accept a number of Iraqi nationals subject to orders of removal,  said Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Christensen said the agency recently arrested a number of individuals, all of whom had criminal convictions for violations ranging from homicide to drug charges and had been ordered removed by an immigration judge. She declined to give more details, citing the ongoing nature of the operation. Trump has said more countries need to take back nationals ordered deported from the United States and has pledged to increase immigration enforcement. Al-Hamza Al-Jamaly, the attache at the Iraqi Embassy in Washington said Iraqi diplomatic and consular missions would coordinate with U.S. authorities to issue travel documents for the deportees  that we can prove to be 'Iraqi' based on our records and investigation.  Attorneys, activists and family members told Reuters that ICE officials had arrested dozens of people in the Chaldean Catholic community in Detroit, Michigan and Kurdish Iraqis in Nashville, Tennessee over the weekend and last week. Many in the communities have been in the United States for decades and were blindsided by the roundups. Reuters could not independently confirm all of the cases. The moves come after the U.S. government dropped Iraq from a list of countries targeted by a revised version of Trump's temporary travel ban issued in March. The March 6 order said Iraq was taken off the list because the Iraqi government had taken steps  to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal.  There are approximately 1,400 Iraqi nationals with final orders of removal currently in the United States, according to U.S. officials. Iraq had previously been considered one of 23  recalcitrant  countries, along with China, Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia and others, that refused to cooperate with ICE's efforts to remove its nationals from the United States, according to congressional testimony by ICE Deputy Director Daniel Ragsdale. Christensen said a deal was struck on March 12 of this year and since then, eight Iraqi nationals had been removed to the country. At least some of the people who were picked up came to the United States as children, got in trouble years ago and already served their sentences, according to immigration attorneys and local activists. They had been given an effective reprieve from deportation because Iraq would not take them back.  Suddenly after years of living their lives, and getting past that, they're being greeted by ICE at the door saying that they're going to be deported to Iraq,  said Drost Kokoye, a Kurdish-American community organizer in Nashville, home to the largest Kurdish population in the United States. Trump Supporters Some of the weekend arrests took place in Michigan's Macomb County, which Trump won by 53.6 percent in the 2016 Presidential race, backed by many in the Iraqi Christian community. At least one family of Trump supporters has been affected by the recent enforcement actions. Nahrain Hamama said ICE agents came to her house on Sunday morning and arrested her 54-year-old husband Usama Hamama, a supermarket manager who goes by  Sam.  He has lived in the United States since childhood and has four U.S.-born children. During the election, all his U.S. citizen relatives were Trump supporters, Hamama said.  He forgot his language, he doesn't speak Arabic anymore. We have no family there on both sides. Where would he go? What would he do? How would he live?  Hamama said. She fears for his health and that he will be targeted by groups in Iraq because of his religion, made more visible because of a cross tattooed on his wrist. Sam got in trouble with the law in his 20s, in what his wife called a  road rage  incident where he brandished a gun during a fight in traffic. He served time in prison and was ordered deported after being released. For the past seven years he has regularly checked in with immigration officials, his wife said.  It is a shame that for one mistake, that he paid for legally, now he has to pay with his own life.

As Prime Minister Theresa May tried to shore up her authority after losing her Conservative government's majority in an election she had called to strengthen her hand in the EU talks, her Brexit Secretary David Davis said negotiations may not now start on June 19 as May had previously said.  That is because she is also trying to schedule the formal debate of her new government program for next week and had on Monday yet to agree a final deal with the small Northern Irish Protestant party on whose support she will rely in parliament. The top civil servant in Davis's Brexit ministry, Oliver Robbins, and Britain's EU envoy met chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier over lunch, EU and British officials said. They discussed how talks could proceed, a year after Britons voted to leave the bloc, but set no date for the start of talks on the substance of a withdrawal scheduled for March 2019. EU officials said they were ready to talk now and handed Robbins texts of their position on two priority issues - rights for EU citizens in Britain and London's financial obligations on departure. An EU summit which May will attend next Thursday and Friday might mean delaying the launch until the following week. May's spokesman said the prime minister, who in March set Britain on a two-year countdown to leaving the EU that included a clean break with the bloc's single market and customs union, was not changing her position on what she wants from Brussels. But there were new calls in London for her to retreat from a position that some critics call a  hard Brexit  and seek a softer option. New Tack on Brexit? One senior pro-EU lawmaker who attended a party meeting with May - and who herself opposed Brexit last year - said the prime minister told them she wanted to build a  consensus  on how to pull out of current arrangements with Britain's main trading partner.  She recognized the different views in the party on Brexit and she also recognized the need to not just reflect the party but indeed the parliament and the country,  the lawmaker said. Ruth Davidson, the influential leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, which voted heavily to remain in the EU last year and where May's party won rather than lost seats on Thursday, called for a deal that put  economic growth first  and said after the meeting with May that the Brexit policy could change. Those advocating a  softer Brexit , notably in the world of  business, are especially keen not to erect new barriers to trade, possibly at the cost of accepting more rules set by the EU in Brussels. A source close to Davidson told Reuters she wanted a  shift in thinking  that would put less emphasis on cutting immigration, a key issue in the Brexit referendum a year ago. Diplomats from some of the 27 other EU member states said they were willing to listen to new proposals from Britain. But many are also concerned that a sharp switch in direction could waste time to reach a deal on an orderly exit and could still fail to meet the approval of British voters. Cancelling Brexit - an option not endorsed by Britain's main parties despite their opposition to it last year - or even stopping the clock to withdrawal in 22 months would require the unanimous approval of the 27. That could be hard to achieve. Customs Union? Some Britons argue for staying in the EU'S single market but EU leaders insist that would require keeping Britain open to free immigration from the EU, accepting EU laws and paying into the bloc's budget. That is something many in Britain oppose fiercely. One possibility for softening Brexit could be for Britain to remain, to some extent, within the EU's customs area. That could solve problems for Northern Ireland, where even May's pro-Brexit prospective allies want to keep the island's land border open to avoid disrupting a 20-year-old peace in the troubled province. It could also allay fears of disruption to complex supply chains for manufacturers, but a customs deal on goods would do little to help London's big banking and insurance industries, which face exclusion from the EU-regulated market in services. Finance industry chiefs told Reuters they were pushing ahead with plans to shift staff and operations to the continent since they could not afford to wait for details of an orderly Brexit deal and had to be prepared for talks breaking down.

(Reuters) - The names of the 49 people killed at a Florida gay nightclub where a gunman turned a dance party into a massacre last year were read aloud on Monday at ceremonies marked by rainbow-hued memorials and guarded by supporters dressed as angels. On the first anniversary of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, officials asked Americans to join in acts of  love and kindness  to honor victims of the three-hour June 12, 2016 rampage at the now-shuttered Pulse club, including survivors still reeling from emotional and physical wounds.  Vigils and rallies were planned across the United States in a show of solidarity with victims of the attack, which authorities called a hateful act against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.  People have asked me what has changed in my life. I tell them everything,  Pulse owner Barbara Poma told several hundred people gathered for a midday ceremony outside the club.  We are all changed.  Choking back sobs, Poma said she missed everything about Pulse, whose site will become a permanent memorial.  Forty-nine pale yellow wreaths emblazoned with the victims' names adorned a wall at the nightclub on Monday, and many people at the ceremony wore T-shirts bearing messages such as  we will not let hate win.

Holding hostages during his standoff with police, Mateen claimed allegiance to a leader of the Islamic State militant group before he was killed in an exchange of gunfire with authorities. His widow, Noor Salman, is charged in federal court with aiding and abetting Mateen's attack and lying to authorities. She was not present for the shooting and has pleaded not guilty.

Analysts said Sipila would most likely seek replace Finns Party with two small opposition parties. That would secure a narrow majority in the parliament and help keep his fiscal policy and reform plans on track.  The Finns party, the country's second-biggest parliamentary group, on Saturday chose Jussi Halla-aho as its new leader and replaced three deputy leaders with anti-immigrant hardliners, steering the moderate protest party towards a more radical right-wing populism. Sipila and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo from the third coalition partner, the pro-European Union National Coalition Party, said they could not cooperate with the Finns party anymore, citing differences in core values and in the immigration and EU policies.  One must not fall in love with this occupation so much that one's values are put for sale,  Sipila told public broadcaster YLE. Halla-aho, who wants Finland to leave the European Union, was fined by Finland's Supreme Court in 2012 for comments on a blog that linked Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft.  We are already facing decisions, like development of EU's defense cooperation, at the European Council's next meeting. This, in a way, means deeper integration, which he opposes... We cannot have uncertainty about these processes and decision making,  Sipila told a news conference earlier on Monday.     Lawmakers in Centre Party and NCP approved the break-up in party meetings, meaning that Sipila will now ask the country's president for permission for the resignation of the government. Sipila said he was aiming to form a new coalition with a parliament majority as quickly as possible. The Centre and National Coalition parties have just 86 of parliament's 200 seats.

LEHTIKUVA/Jussi Nukari/ via REUTERS These may become tough negotiations, and they may be long too. But my aim is that the government program would be as close as possible to the current one,  Sipila said, without naming preferred new partners. Halla-aho posted a message on Facebook, saying he would have liked to continue in the coalition, but Sipila and Orpo had not agreed to his demands for tougher immigration policies. Reforms Slideshow (2 Images)Snap elections are rare in Finland, which has been run by coalition governments with strong majorities for decades. Analysts said the most likely way forward would be to bring the smaller Swedish People's Party and Christian Democrats into the government.  Both have said they are ready to negotiate. Such an arrangement would give the new coalition 101 of parliament's 200 seats.  That will be a coalition with a very narrow majority, and the parties will not come to rescue the government for free,  said Ilkka Ruostetsaari, professor of politics at the University of Tampere. For Sipila and Orpo, at stake are major healthcare and local government reform, which are key to their plan to balance public finances. The government has outlined its plans but has yet to agree on details.  The two parties have lots at stake in this government, but apparently cooperating with the Finns party from now on is a bigger risk than compromising the reforms,  Ruostetsaari said. Finland is recovering from a decade of stagnation. The government has sought to improve growth and curb public debt growth by cutting spending and reforming labor laws.

An island-wide referendum on Sunday favored statehood in a 97 percent landslide, though voter turnout reached just 23 percent as opponents of Governor Ricardo Rossello's push to become a state boycotted the vote. The non-binding plebiscite is not expected to sway the U.S. Congress, which would have to agree to make Puerto Rico a state. Currently a U.S. territory, the island is struggling with $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, and is not viewed as a priority in Washington.   Rossello, who campaigned on a push for statehood, said in a telephone interview with Reuters that he will go to the U.S. capital this week to urge federal lawmakers to begin the process of admitting Puerto Rico into the union.  We will make sure this becomes an issue,  Rossello said. The vote comes at a critical time for Puerto Rico, whose hazy status - which dates to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain - has contributed to its ongoing economic crisis. Last month, the island filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Its woes make statehood even more urgent, Rossello said.  Statehood brings stability, allows us to have fewer rule-changes from Congress, provides resources to our people,  he said.  Divided Island Sunday's referendum, which cost Puerto Rico between $5 million and $7 million, according to government estimates, was the island's fifth since 1967 - and the third in which pro-statehood sentiments triumphed, though none have moved Congress to act.  If the U.S. is going to go to Venezuela and Cuba and Afghanistan and push democracy abroad, theyâve got to do the same  with their own territories, he said.  But Puerto Ricans are skeptical the island's status will change.  This has all been a waste of time,  said taxi driver Felix Salasarar, 54, adding that federal lawmakers will  look at the voter turnout and say, 'where's the will of the people?'   Working against the governor may be a perception in Washington that Sunday's vote was not fair.  The U.S. Department of Justice in April called on Rossello to change ballot language that initially did not give voters an option to remain a U.S. territory.  Rossello told Reuters he made that decision because the territory option - which Rossello equates to colonialism - already lost in a previous status referendum, in 2012, making this year's vote a choice between statehood and independence.  The Justice department viewed the language as politically unfair to millions of Puerto Ricans who favor territory status, prompting Rossello to add the territory option. But the Justice department never reviewed or approved the new language. To be sure, Sunday's results do not reflect the true nature of Puerto Ricans' views on statehood, which are fairly evenly divided between those who favor it and those who do not, based upon historical election results. Statehooder Rossello, for example, won his own election with just 42 percent of the vote. But that, the governor said, is how democracy works:  Everybody knows that those who go through the voting process have a louder voice than those who don't,  he said. Carolina Santos, a single working mother struggling to make her mortgage payments, said bankrupt Puerto Rico has more important things to worry about than a status vote.  Maybe we should focus more on fixing our financial problems and our schools,  she said.

Following a cabinet meeting at Downing Street, Davidson expressed confidence that the shape of Brexit would differ after a national election in which Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May lost her overall parliamentary majority.  Davidson's Scottish Conservatives however gained 12 more lawmakers, giving her some clout on the direction of policy in the Westminster government.  The country has told us that they want us to be the government, behind the prime minister, but what they've said is that they want us to work with others - that's what not having a majority means,  Davidson said after the meeting ended.  But I do think there can be changes in the offer of Brexit as we go forward,  she said.  What's clear is that there is going to be a real imperative on the economic impact of Brexit.  Davidson is not a Westminster lawmaker but spearheaded her party's Scottish election campaign. She supports single market membership as part of any Brexit deal, a party source said.  She understands, however, it may not be possible to secure that as part of the Brexit negotiations, the source added. EU leaders have repeatedly said membership of the single market is linked inextricably with the freedom of movement principle which allows workers to move around the bloc freely. May is negotiating a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, a Northern Irish party with 10 seats, that would allow her to pass laws.  The shortfall has opened a debate about May's Brexit plans, which include leaving the EU's single market, striking a new customs deal and limiting immigration from Europe.  We must, in my view, seek to deliver an open Brexit, not a closed one, which puts our country's economic growth first,  Davidson told reporters on Friday.  May's approach to Brexit is unchanged by the election, her spokesman said on Monday. But one lawmaker said May recognized that a broader consensus needs to be built during Monday's meeting with Conservative members of parliament. Some senior ministers and lawmakers are also seeking a Brexit strategy that takes more account of the economic impact of limiting immigration.  What we have said is that we are going to deliver on the wishes of the British public and that was to retake control of borders and laws,  May's spokesman said.  The EU has been clear that you canât be in the single market and achieve those goals.  Separately, the minister representing Scotland in May's cabinet, David Mundell, said the final Brexit deal should be supported in Britain's parliament across the political divide.  I don't want to see the Brexit deal going through (Britain's national parliament) the House of Commons with a majority of one, I want to see it going through the House of Commons with support across parties,  Mundell told BBC Scotland. Speaking in London, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said supporters of a so-called hard Brexit have been left  dead in the water  by May's failure to secure a majority in last week's election. Sturgeon's Scottish National Party won 35 of Scotland's 59 seats in Britain's 650-seat parliament in the June 8 election.

The results may help doctors walk a tightrope in treating the tremors and muscle rigidity of Parkinson's itself, where the beneficial effects of levodopa wane over time, producing so-called  off  times. Efforts to shorten the off times by increasing the levodopa dose lead to the other unwanted movements, a condition known as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). LID arises in more than half of Parkinson's patients who have taken levodopa for four to six years and in more than 90 percent of patients who have been on the drug for a decade. The disease itself affects nearly a million people in the U.S., according to the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. In the new study, when 58 patients were given placebo for 12 weeks, they improved by 8.0 points on a test designed to measure their symptoms that has a maximum score of 104. But for the 63 people on extended-release amantadine, the improvement was 15.9 points. And when doctors looked at patientsâ off times, they found amantadine decreased the duration by about 34 minutes per day compared to placebo recipients, who saw the duration of their unwanted movements increase by about 18 minutes.  This would be the first medicine, if approved, to take care of the dyskinesia and the off times,  lead author Dr. Rajesh Pahwa, director of the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Center at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, told Reuters Health. The study, known as EASE LID, did not compare this formulation of amantadine to other LID therapies, including immediate-release amantadine, which has to be taken two or three times a day. The manufacturer, California-based Adamas Pharmaceuticals, paid for the test. The long-acting version used in the current study is also known as ADS-5102.  The results demonstrated that extended-release amantadine was well tolerated, safe, and effective for the treatment of LID,  Dr. Aparna Wagle Shukla of the University of Florida, Gainesville writes in an editorial in JAMA Neurology, where the study appears.  It remains to be established whether the benefits of this new pill will justify the cost.  But the drug has side effects, including insomnia, agitation, constipation, dizziness and, most commonly, hallucinations, which were experienced by nearly one out of four patients. Those unwanted properties caused one in five patients to discontinue the drug, a rate three times higher than seen with placebo. Immediate-release amantadine is not approved as a treatment for dyskinesia, but some doctors prescribe it anyway despite limited evidence, Pahwa said. Attempts to use nicotine, marijuana or the antiepilepsy drug levetiracetam as therapies have shown even less promise. The experimental drug was given in the evening so blood levels would peak around noon, when LID symptoms are most likely to appear. The timing is also less likely to cause insomnia. In addition to the hallucinations experienced by nearly a quarter of the drug recipients, other prominent side effect included swelling, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation and falls. The researchers said the visual hallucinations were easily tolerated and didn't affect a person's normal function. Only one of the drug recipients reported a severe hallucination. Five of the 15 who reported hallucinations discontinued treatment.  All Parkinson's medicines in general can cause hallucinations,  Pahwa noted. With the experimental drug,  some can have hallucinations five minutes a day once a week. It's something patients need to be aware of.

Whatâs more, index funds, which are rapidly becoming the dominant force in investment management, have the lowest incentive to spend money to chivy the companies whose shares they hold to perform better. The upshot is that companies in the U.S. are increasingly free to act without proper shareholder oversight, theoretically leading to more executive self-dealing, lower investment returns and lower economic growth. Activist hedge fund investors are part of this ecosystem, and can do excellent work in holding corporate feet to the fire, but they are, while growing, relatively few in number and will tend to have a short-to-medium-term outlook. âInvestment managers of mutual funds - both index funds and actively managed funds - have incentives to under-spend on stewardship and to side excessively with managers of corporations,â Lucian Bebchuk and Scott Hirst, both of Harvard Law School, andÂ Alma Cohen of Tel Aviv University write in a newly revised study. (here) âWe show that these incentives are especially acute for managers of index funds, and that the rise of such funds has system-wide adverse consequences for corporate governance.â The nexus of the problem, as is so often the case, is a regulation intended to protect investors in mutual and similar funds from self-dealing by asset management companies themselves. Under these rules if a mutual fund spends a dollar on corporate governance issues - and the research and campaigns involved are labor intensive -Â  they must bear those costs out of their fee income. So if a mutual fund wants to launch a proxy fight it bears the cost out of its fees. In theory this allows some upside to activist stewardship for active fund managers, but not a lot. Given that the average active equity management fee is 79 basis points annually, active investors spending money on corporate governance only stand able to benefit by the amount it increases the value of the holdings times 0.79 percent, not a lot. They also might attract new funds by outperforming against active peers based on corporate governance campaigns, but this too makes a weak tea. Active managers really only have an incentive to intervene and spend money beating up company management if they are overweight a company. This also means they have the opposite incentive if they are underweight. Rise and Rise of Index Funds Thatâs not even counting the conflicts of interest which fund families can have; as they provide corporations with pension and cash management services, angering them with a proxy fight isnât always good business. For index funds the self-interest math is even worse. If an index fund can drive up the value of a holding it will collect more fees, as fees are calculated on a percent of portfolio basis, but that is a tiny amount. The average equity index fund stands to make just 12 basis points annually on the increase in value of a holding if it goes higher due to better corporate governance. But index funds, which own almost a third of the equity market, donât differentiate themselves on performance; their selling proposition is a market return at a low price. So if one index fund family decides to spend a lot of money on corporate governance research and campaigns, their peers can get a free ride, enjoying the extra fee income as shares rise in value but funding none of the underlying costs. Research by the Wall Street Journal in October found that Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, who together control about $7.5 trillion in index fund assets, have between 40 and 50 employees dedicated to voting and stewardship activities. (here) Those three, and a host of other institutional investors, as part of the Investor Stewardship Group, have launched a framework intended to set a baseline of investment stewardship and corporate governance guidelines. This takes effect Jan 1, 2018. (www.isgframework.org/) This is welcome, but the underlying tension between profits at the asset manager level and stewardship issues remains. âThese agency problems limit the extent to which our corporate governance system is able to benefit from the increased concentration of shareholdings, and are a key impediment to improving the governance of publicly traded corporations,â Bebchuk, Cohen and Hirst write. One welcome step would be a review of the regulations requiring investment firms to eat all of the costs of stewardship out of their fees. With returns in equities potentially sub-par for the next decade or more due to demographic and other pressures, pressuring corporate America to run itself better may prove to be money well spent.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group of Kurdish and Arab militias supported by a U.S.-led coalition, began to attack Raqqa last Tuesday with the aim of taking it from Islamic State militants, after a months-long campaign to cut it off.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said the SDF took the al-Sanaa industrial neighborhood on Monday as part of their push into the eastern half of the city, and had reached the walls of the Old City neighborhood. SDF media officer Ahmad Mohammed said the SDF had reached the walls but there were still fierce clashes in al-Sanaa and the district had not yet been totally secured. The Old City, east of central Raqqa, is a neighborhood of modern housing bordered on two sides by fortified city walls built in the eighth century by the Abbasid Islamic Caliphate which at one point used Raqqa as its capital. Residents said on Monday the Old City area was being shelled intensely. The U.S.-led coalition estimates that Raqqa, which Islamic State seized from Syrian rebels in 2014 during their lightning advance in Syria and Iraq, is defended by 3,000 to 4,000 jihadists. It has been a hub both for Islamic State's military leaders and its bureaucrats, and has been used to plot attacks in countries around the world. The SDF also advanced from north of the city on Monday, taking a sugar factory complex northeast of Raqqa. A video said to show SDF officers within the complex shows heavy damage to the factory. Since the offensive began the SDF, supported by heavy coalition air strikes, have taken territory to the west, east and north of the city.  The fighting has caused large numbers of people to flee the city and surrounding areas.

The Dutch holding company said on Monday that it plans to sell up to 7 percent of Altice USA, indicating an expected price range of $27-$31 per share, valuing the business at between $20 billion and $22 billion.  Of the projected $1.6 billion in proceeds at the top end of the price range, Altice USA would receive $374 million because about three quarters of the shares sold will be offered by London-based private equity firm BC Partners and fellow stakeholder the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). The IPO announced in April is viewed as a means for Altice's founder, French billionaire Patrick Drahi, to expand his burgeoning U.S. cable empire by giving Altice USA public stock it can use for further acquisitions. Altice USA will need all the financial firepower it can muster to compete for U.S. acquisitions with rivals Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) in an expected wave of sector consolidation.  The company has yet to indicate when it expects the IPO to take place. Upon completion of the IPO, Altice USA's parent and its affiliates will hold 75.2 percent of the company's capital and 98.5 percent of the voting rights thanks to a separate bundle of stock. BC Partners and CPPIB would jointly own about 17 percent of Altice USA, according to its filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This means that Drahi, the majority owner of Altice, will keep tight control of its U.S. division, led by Dexter Goei.

Whatâs more, index funds, which are rapidly becoming the dominant force in investment management, have the lowest incentive to spend money to chivy the companies whose shares they hold to perform better. The upshot is that companies in the U.S. are increasingly free to act without proper shareholder oversight, theoretically leading to more executive self-dealing, lower investment returns and lower economic growth. Activist hedge fund investors are part of this ecosystem, and can do excellent work in holding corporate feet to the fire, but they are, while growing, relatively few in number and will tend to have a short-to-medium-term outlook. âInvestment managers of mutual funds - both index funds and actively managed funds - have incentives to under-spend on stewardship and to side excessively with managers of corporations,â Lucian Bebchuk and Scott Hirst, both of Harvard Law School, andÂ Alma Cohen of Tel Aviv University write in a newly revised study. (here) âWe show that these incentives are especially acute for managers of index funds, and that the rise of such funds has system-wide adverse consequences for corporate governance.â The nexus of the problem, as is so often the case, is a regulation intended to protect investors in mutual and similar funds from self-dealing by asset management companies themselves. Under these rules if a mutual fund spends a dollar on corporate governance issues - and the research and campaigns involved are labor intensive -Â  they must bear those costs out of their fee income. So if a mutual fund wants to launch a proxy fight it bears the cost out of its fees. In theory this allows some upside to activist stewardship for active fund managers, but not a lot. Given that the average active equity management fee is 79 basis points annually, active investors spending money on corporate governance only stand able to benefit by the amount it increases the value of the holdings times 0.79 percent, not a lot. They also might attract new funds by outperforming against active peers based on corporate governance campaigns, but this too makes a weak tea. Active managers really only have an incentive to intervene and spend money beating up company management if they are overweight a company. This also means they have the opposite incentive if they are underweight. Rise and Rise of Index Funds Thatâs not even counting the conflicts of interest which fund families can have; as they provide corporations with pension and cash management services, angering them with a proxy fight isnât always good business.

Analysts said Sipila would most likely seek replace Finns Party with two small opposition parties. That would secure a narrow majority in the parliament and help keep his fiscal policy and reform plans on track.  The Finns party, the country's second-biggest parliamentary group, on Saturday chose Jussi Halla-aho as its new leader and replaced three deputy leaders with anti-immigrant hardliners, steering the moderate protest party towards a more radical right-wing populism. Sipila and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo from the third coalition partner, the pro-European Union National Coalition Party, said they could not cooperate with the Finns party anymore, citing differences in core values and in the immigration and EU policies.  One must not fall in love with this occupation so much that one's values are put for sale,  Sipila told public broadcaster YLE. Halla-aho, who wants Finland to leave the European Union, was fined by Finland's Supreme Court in 2012 for comments on a blog that linked Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft.  We are already facing decisions, like development of EU's defense cooperation, at the European Council's next meeting. This, in a way, means deeper integration, which he opposes... We cannot have uncertainty about these processes and decision making,  Sipila told a news conference earlier on Monday.     Lawmakers in Centre Party and NCP approved the break-up in party meetings, meaning that Sipila will now ask the country's president for permission for the resignation of the government. Sipila said he was aiming to form a new coalition with a parliament majority as quickly as possible. The Centre and National Coalition parties have just 86 of parliament's 200 seats.

LEHTIKUVA/Jussi Nukari/ via REUTERS These may become tough negotiations, and they may be long too. But my aim is that the government program would be as close as possible to the current one,  Sipila said, without naming preferred new partners. Halla-aho posted a message on Facebook, saying he would have liked to continue in the coalition, but Sipila and Orpo had not agreed to his demands for tougher immigration policies. Reforms Slideshow (2 Images)Snap elections are rare in Finland, which has been run by coalition governments with strong majorities for decades. Analysts said the most likely way forward would be to bring the smaller Swedish People's Party and Christian Democrats into the government.  Both have said they are ready to negotiate. Such an arrangement would give the new coalition 101 of parliament's 200 seats.  That will be a coalition with a very narrow majority, and the parties will not come to rescue the government for free,  said Ilkka Ruostetsaari, professor of politics at the University of Tampere. For Sipila and Orpo, at stake are major healthcare and local government reform, which are key to their plan to balance public finances. The government has outlined its plans but has yet to agree on details.  The two parties have lots at stake in this government, but apparently cooperating with the Finns party from now on is a bigger risk than compromising the reforms,  Ruostetsaari said. Finland is recovering from a decade of stagnation. The government has sought to improve growth and curb public debt growth by cutting spending and reforming labor laws. Finland's 10-year government bond yield nudged higher after the PM's announcement, widening the spread over benchmark German Bund yields to its greatest in almost three weeks.

Ties between the two big democracies grew rapidly under the administration of former President Barack Obama which saw India as a partner to balance China's growing weight in Asia.  But Trump has focused on building ties with China, seeing it as key to tackling regional problems such as North Korea's nuclear programme.  The Indian ministry said Modi's talks with Trump would lay the ground for a further expansion in ties, allaying some of the anxiety that had crept in about a drift in relations.   Their discussions will provide a new direction for deeper bilateral engagement on issues of mutual interest and consolidation of multidimensional strategic partnership between India and the U.S.,  the ministry said in a statement. In Washington, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the two leaders will discuss topics including economic growth, the fight against terrorism, expanding defense cooperation and growing U.S.-India trade.  You can expect the two of them to set forth a vision that will expand the U.S.-India partnership in an ambitious and worthy way,  Spicer said. The United States has emerged as a top arms supplier to India and the two sides will be looking to move forward with deals such as unarmed drones that India wants for its navy, sources said.  One issue that the two leaders face is resolving conflict arising out of the push they are both making at home to boost industry and create jobs.  Modi has been driving a make-in-India campaign to press foreign arms suppliers to set up factories in India and transfer technology instead of selling off-the-shelf, which has made India one of the world's biggest arms importers without any domestic production base. Trump, on the other hand, has railed against firms moving factories outside the United States and has demanded U.S. companies invest at home as part of his  America First  campaign. Trump's review of a visa programme under which thousands of skilled Indian workers go to the United States is also a top concern for India.

He's just been built for that moment,  Cleveland star forward LeBron James told reporters.  I said that over and over again - that he's always been built for the biggest moments, and he showed that once again. It's not surprising. He's just that special.  James isn't doing so bad himself with averages of 31.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 10.5 assists and he posted his ninth career playoff triple-double in Game 4 to break a tie with legendary Magic Johnson for most all-time. ABOUT THE WARRIORS: Forward Draymond Green's absence in Game 5 of last season's Finals due to his accumulation of technical fouls helped fuel Cleveland's comeback but Green says the situation is different this season as the reminders increase.  I'm sure that's just the world we live in,  Green told reporters.  But we were up 3-0 (this year). We weren't up 3-0 last year. So, it's a little different. And at the end of the day, the series is a little different. Thank God I get to play in Game 5.  Green's offense has been much quieter than his vocal cords as he is averaging 11.3 points on just 35.6 percent shooting to go along with 9.8 rebounds per game. Buzzer Beaters 1. Warriors SF Kevin Durant has topped 30 points in all four games and is averaging 34.3 points and 8.8 rebounds in the series. 2. Cleveland PF Kevin Love, who is averaging 18.5 points in the series, made 6-of-8 3-pointers in Game 4 after being 3-of-14 over the previous two contests. 3. Golden State PG Stephen Curry is averaging 25 points in the Finals but had just 14 on 4-of-13 shooting in Game 4.

Five-Star candidates failed to qualify for run-off ballots in the 25 largest cities up for grabs on Sunday, including the northern port city of Genoa, home to the movement's founder, comedian Beppe Grillo. By contrast, center-right parties including former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia performed strongly, suggesting they could be a contender at the general election if they can unite around a single leader.  National elections must be held by the first half of next year and could come as early as this autumn, meaning Sunday's vote in 1,000 towns and cities was an important test of political strength. Newspaper headlines and pundits pounced on the results, saying the 5-Star might have peaked, but Grillo shot back on Monday, confidently predicting his group would bounce back.  Everyone is gloating, putting forward rarefied analysis on the death of the 5-Star and the return of a bipolar (political) system,  Grillo wrote on his blog.  Convince yourself this is true so you can sleep more soundly. We will continue forward on our path.   Related CoverageItaly's 5-Star Movement seen failing in local vote: exit polls5-Star bases much of its appeal on fighting corruption, its flagship policy is a  citizens wage  to help Italy's army of unemployed, and it promises a referendum on membership of the euro currency blamed by many for years of economic underperformance. The party had hoped to build on last year's election successes, when it took control of 19 large towns and cities, including Rome. But its rule in the capital has been mired in controversy, and its grassroots operations elsewhere have been snarled by internal feuding. Despite its local difficulties, the most recent opinion polls taken ahead of Sunday's vote say the 5-Star would win more than 30 percent in a national race, just ahead of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi. Beppe Grillo, the founder of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, talks during a march in support of the 'No' vote in the upcoming constitutional reform referendum in Rome, Italy November 26, 2016.Remo Casilli - RTSTFSPSilvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the far-right Northern League - long-time allies but with increasingly diverging political agendas - trail with less than 15 percent each. The center-right fared strongly on Sunday where Forza Italia and the League put aside their divisions and ran together, taking the lead in 13 of the 24 main municipal races. A run-off ballot between the two leading candidates is due on June 25.   We hope that Renzi faces the consequences of this latest no-confidence vote in the government,  said Matteo Salvini, leader of the League. Berlusconi said the vote proved that  the center-right can win when it is united,  while pointing out that his own party got more votes than the League. He also warned against writing off 5-Star, saying it remained  a formidable force which it would be short-sighted to under-estimate.  The only outright winner in a major city on Sunday was Leoluca Orlando, who led the center-left to victory in the Sicilian capital Palermo, securing his fifth mandate.  An anti-mafia firebrand, Orlando has governed the city for 16 of the past 32 years. Most of the 5-Star candidates would have been new to government. Last year the 5-Star cast its victory in Rome, the nation's capital, as proof it was ready to govern.  But Mayor Virginia Raggi has been dogged by legal scandals since taking office, and she has appeared slow to revive a city hobbled by years of corruption and economic decline. Until last week, Italy's main parties had been trying to pass a new proportional electoral law together, but the deal unraveled. Last week, markets appeared wary of more political instability in Italy, which has the euro zone's highest public debt after Greece and has been underperforming, fearing an autumn election could interfere with the presentation of a belt-tightening 2018 budget.

Trump,Luis Morales,Santana,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Stephen Broome,USA,COURT/CITIZENSHIP,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down a gender distinction in U.S. immigration law that treats mothers and fathers differently when determining a child's citizenship, calling such inequality  stunningly anachronistic.  The high court, in a 8-0 ruling authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, found that a provision in federal law that defines how people born overseas can be eligible for U.S. citizenship violated the U.S. Constitution's equal protection guarantee. The ruling, however, may not help the man who brought the case, New York resident Luis Morales-Santana, who was seeking to avoid deportation to the Dominican Republic after being convicted of several offenses. The law requires that unwed fathers who are American citizens spend at least five years living in the United States - a 2012 amendment reduced it from 10 years - before they can confer citizenship to a child born abroad, out of wedlock and to a partner who is not a U.S. citizen. For unwed U.S. mothers in the same situation, the requirement was only one year. In the ruling, the Supreme Court said that until Congress revises the law, both women and men will be covered by the five-year requirement. Ginsburg, known for her work on gender equality before she became a jurist, wrote for the court that in light of the Supreme Court's various rulings regarding the equal protection guarantee since 1971, having separate  duration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers who have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly anachronistic.  The arguments made in defense of the law by former President Barack Obama's administration before he left office in January  cannot withstand inspection under a Constitution that requires the government to respect the equal dignity and stature of its male and female citizens,  Ginsburg wrote. Morales-Santana's deceased father was an American citizen, while his mother was not. His father failed to meet the law's five-year requirements by 20 days. His lawyer, Stephen Broome, said he is reviewing how the ruling affects his client. Morales-Santana, 54, was born in the Dominican Republican and has lived legally in the United States since 1975. He was convicted of several criminal offenses in 1995, including two counts of robbery and four counts of attempted murder. The U.S. government has sought to deport him since 2000. The high court split 4-4 on the same issue in 2011. In July 2015, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York sided with Morales-Santana and struck down the law at issue, saying it applied  impermissible stereotyping  in imposing a tougher burden on fathers. The U.S. Justice Department sought to defend the law and asked the high court to take the case. The case is one of several with immigration-related themes that are before the justices at a time when President Donald Trump's administration is pursing efforts to strengthen immigration enforcement.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-citizenship-idUSL1N1J917O"},

Payments to the president's enterprises from foreign and domestic governments through his hospitality empire draw business away from Maryland and D.C. venues and put local governments under pressure to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment, according to the complaint. Foreign and domestic government payments to Trump's businesses were the target of a similar lawsuit brought in January by plaintiffs including an ethics nonprofit group, and Democratic lawmakers have blasted them as potential corrupting influences on Trump. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require the customers to identify themselves.  Every time the president has spoken about drawing a line between his presidency and his businesses, heâs walked those promises back,  said D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said at a news conference on Monday. The case by Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, both Democrats, has a better chance in court as the first government action over allegations that Trump, a Republican, violated the Constitution's so-called emoluments clauses, legal experts said. Democratic attorneys general have taken a lead role in challenging Trump policies, successfully blocking executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries. The Maryland and D.C. attorneys general are seeking an order in U.S. District Court in Maryland preventing Trump from continuing to receive government payments beyond his salary. White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday rejected the claim that Trump's business interests violated the Constitution and said  partisan politics  were behind the lawsuit. Trump's lawyers will likely move to dismiss the case, he said. The Justice Department declined to comment. Trump's ownership in hundreds of businesses hurts Maryland and D.C. and violates  emoluments  clauses in the Constitution that bar the president from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval as well as from domestic governments under any circumstances, according to the complaint. While Trump turned over management of the umbrella Trump Organization in January to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, he still owns his businesses, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, and can draw revenue from them at any time. 'No Meaning Whatsoever' The attorneys general argued they had standing to sue Trump because their citizens will be harmed if payments to Trump are used to influence his allocation of federal funds. They also said local hospitality companies, including state-owned facilities, are being harmed. The Justice Department on Friday argued in the other lawsuit that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to sue because they cannot allege enough specific harm caused by Trump's businesses. The attorneys general have a better chance of establishing standing, legal scholars said, although they are divided over whether the AGs will ultimately succeed. Plaintiffs typically only have standing to file lawsuits under federal law if they can show they have been injured and a court ruling would remedy the harm. Fordham Law School Professor Jed Shugerman said state governments' special duty to protect their citizens means they face a lower bar to standing in federal court, and the AG lawsuit should proceed. However, Derek Muller, a professor at Pepperdine University School of Law, said it was unclear that this harm could be remedied by a favorable ruling. The government has also said Trump hotel revenue does not fit the definition of an improper payment under the Constitution. Payments to Trump's hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president, the government said. âIf the Justice Department is correct, the emoluments clause has no meaning whatsoever,â said Frosh, the Maryland official. âThe president can stand over here with his president of the United States hat and heâs not allowed to take payments.

McMahon and others at National Securities Corporation, for instance, bought or sold between 200 and 900 shares of Apple stock for Haus nine times in about a year - racking up $27,000 in fees, according to a 2015 complaint Haus filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Haus alerted the regulator to what he called improper âchurningâ of his account to harvest excessive fees. But the allegation could hardly have come as a surprise to FINRA, the industryâs self-regulating body, which is charged by Congress with protecting investors from unscrupulous brokers. FINRA has fined National at least 25 times since 2000. As of earlier this year,  35 percent of Nationalâs 714 brokers had a history of regulatory run-ins, legal disputes or personal financial difficulties that FINRA requires brokers to disclose to investors, according to a Reuters analysis of FINRA data. McMahon did not respond to requests for comment. National declined to comment. National is among 48 firms where at least 30 percent of brokers have such FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis, which examined only the 12 most serious incidents among the 23 that FINRA requires brokers to disclose. That compares to 9 percent of brokers industry-wide who have at least one of those 12 FINRA flags on their record. In total, the 48 firms oversee about 4,600 brokers and billions of dollars in investor funds. For a graphic with the complete list of firms and statistics on each, see: tmsnrt.rs/2rtbhOl FINRA officials acknowledged in interviews with Reuters that the longstanding hiring practices at certain firms are a threat to investors. But they also argued that they can do little to stop firms from hiring high concentrations of potentially problematic brokers because doing so is not illegal. That leaves investors like Haus vulnerable to a small group of brokerages that regularly hire advisors with blemishes on their backgrounds that would make them unemployable at most firms, former regulators and industry experts said. The dozen FINRA flags examined by Reuters include regulatory sanctions for misconduct, employment terminations after allegations of misconduct and payments by firms to settle customer complaints. They also include brokersâ personal financial troubles, such as bankruptcies or liens for nonpayment of debts. (For full coverage, including an explanation of Reuters methodology, see: here ) Last year, a FINRA official told Reuters, the regulator identified 90 firms as posing the highest risk to investors and flagged them internally for higher scrutiny. But FINRA declined to name the firms publicly or to release statistics showing the concentration of brokers with a history of FINRA flags within each firm. In an interview with Reuters, FINRAâs executive vice president of regulatory operations, Susan Axelrod, declined to comment on any specific firm identified by Reuters. She would not directly address why the regulator will not publicly name the firms it identified as high-risk. âLetâs just say those are not new names to us,â she said of the firms identified by Reuters. FINRA Chief Executive Robert Cook, however, addressed its unwillingness to name names in a speech on Monday morning in Washington at Georgetown University, according to prepared remarks released by FINRA. âWe must consider fairness and due process,â Cook said. âFINRA does not possess a crystal ball - someone who we may identify as a high-risk broker for oversight purposes is not necessarily a bad actor.â The regulator has created a dedicated unit focused on those high-risk firms, Axelrod told Reuters, but she declined to discuss its budget, staffing or specific duties. Cook on Monday said the unit included an unstated number of âexaminers and managersâ with experience dealing with high-risk brokers. FINRA makes data on individual brokersâ backgrounds available through its Brokercheck website, which Axelrod said provides âunparalleled transparencyâ to investors. That site allows the public to search histories of complaints and sanctions against individual brokers â but only one at a time. The regulator will not release the data in bulk form, such as a database, that would enable researchers to identify firms with high concentrations of brokers with a history of FINRA flags. Reuters analyzed the FINRA data after receiving it from researchers at Columbia University Law School DataLab, who wrote computer code to extract it from the regulatorâs website. Reuters sought comment from officials at all 48 firms. Some responded that many of the FINRA-mandated disclosures do not necessarily equate to misconduct by brokers, such as when a firm pays a client to settle a complaint without admitting wrongdoing. Cook, the FINRA chief, echoed that point in his speech Monday. âA broker who has an unpaid lien because of a debt accrued due to a medical issue in her family must disclose that lien,â he said. âThat event should not be treated the same as fraud or stealing money from customers.â At least one executive from a firm identified in the Reuters analysis serves on FINRAâs 24-member Board of Governors - Brian Kovack, president of Fort Lauderdale-based Kovack Securities Inc. Thirty-four percent of the firmâs 388 brokers have a history of FINRA flags, according to the Reuters analysis. In a statement, Brian Kovack attributed those figures to the firmâs decision to take on a large number of new brokers from another brokerage in 2014, which prevented the firm from using its usual vetting process for new employees. Asked why, three years later, the firm still has a high concentration of brokers with FINRA flags, Kovack said it took âconsiderableâ time to ensure the review of new brokersâ backgrounds was âfair and transparent.â After the review, the firm asked some advisors to leave, Kovack said, without specifying how many or the reasons they were dismissed. Self-Regulation FINRA is not a government agency, but rather an industry-financed âself-regulatory organizationâ - as FINRA puts it - that is not subject to public records laws and receives no taxpayer support. Its annual operating budget of about $1 billion - supporting about 3,500 staffers in 16 offices - comes primarily from dues paid by member firms and individual brokers. FINRA has the power to fine, suspend and ban firms and brokers, and it can refer potentially criminal cases to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Last year, in an unlikely collaboration, Senators Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, sent FINRA a letter demanding the regulator do more to stop broker misconduct and to prevent those with troubled histories from concentrating in the same firms. âFINRA is not doing nearly enough to fulfill its investor protection mission,â the letter read. The regulator responded with a letter on June 15 of last year saying that it closely oversees firms âto determine whether they present a heightened risk to investors.â From 2013 to mid-2016, the regulator told the senators, it identified 279 âhigh-riskâ brokers. After identifying them, the regulator permanently banned 238 brokers from the industry for subsequent violations. FINRA oversees about 3,800 brokerages and 630,000 brokers. In interviews with Reuters, Axelrod pointed to firms that FINRA expelled. The regulator shut down about 130 firms in the six years ending in January 2017, with many cited for securities fraud, misuse of funds or falsifying records. But the Reuters analysis of FINRA data found that the regulator did not expel the firmâs chief executive in 58 percent of those cases, leaving him or her free to join other brokerages. The brokers at those banned firms typically were also able to continue working in the industry. Axelrod said that FINRA gives extra scrutiny to former executives of expelled firms after they show up with new jobs at other firms. âOverwhelmingâ Evidence Regulators in at least one state think more can be done to crack down on brokers and brokerages with track records of violations. Massachusetts securities regulators are considering changing their licensing practices after completing a review last year of brokerages with a high proportion of brokers with troubled histories. âThe evidence is pretty overwhelming that there is a practice here - a history here - of people moving from one firm to another and re-offending,â Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin told Reuters. âWe canât simply stand by and say, âThe companies will do a better job.â They wonât do a better job unless they feel some incentive.â Some former regulators contacted by Reuters agreed with FINRAâs policy of withholding its internal risk ratings of firms from the public. Susan Merrill - former head of enforcement at FINRA and now a partner with the law firm Sidley Austin LLP - said that releasing such ratings would be unfair to firms who have not necessarily broken laws or regulations. âIf there is a finding by the regulator,â Merrill said, âthen thatâs fair game.â FINRAâs former CEO, Richard Ketchum, told Reuters last June that the regulator was considering publicly disclosing more information about firms with high concentrations of problematic brokers. âWe are looking hard at questions about how we can appropriately and fairly provide that broader disclosure ... when firms have concentrations of persons that have similar problems,â Ketchum said in an interview. Cook said Monday that FINRA was considering additional measures to rein in high-risk brokers, but he didnât go into specifics. Wolves of Wall Street Many of the 48 firms identified by Reuters regularly cold-call customers on the phone with high-pressure sales pitches, according to regulatory complaints and sanctions against the firms and their brokers. Long Island, New York, has historically been a haven for boiler-room brokerages, which inspired the movie, âThe Wolf of Wall Street,â based on the true story of broker Jordan Belfort and his firm, Stratton Oakmont. Belfort pleaded guilty to securities fraud and money laundering in 1999. FINRA warned in a news release last year that boiler-room tactics were on the rise, particularly those targeting the elderly and other vulnerable investors. Brokers generally know which firms will hire them despite past sanctions, said Dean Jeske, a lawyer at Foley & Lardner and FINRAâs former deputy regional chief counsel for enforcement in the Midwest. âWhen you get a mark on your (record), itâs hard to get a job at Morgan Stanley or Merrill Lynch,â Jeske said. Mike McMahon has had little trouble landing jobs at brokerages despite a trail of allegations and settlements. McMahon left National in 2014 and later joined a smaller firm, Long Island-based Worden Capital Management - where 43 percent of 79 brokers had a history of FINRA flags as of earlier this year. Forty-one percent of the firmâs brokers had at some point in their careers worked at firms that were later expelled by FINRA, according to the Reuters analysis. Jamie Worden, head of Worden Capital, said in a statement that his firmâs compliance team vets all prospective brokers and that FINRA-mandated disclosures do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. âThe public disclosures only represent a sliver of the information surrounding any circumstance,â Worden said. McMahon, National and another firm where he worked have agreed to pay a total of $1.35 million since 2007 to settle 10 separate client complaints involving McMahon, according to McMahonâs record on FINRAâs BrokerCheck website. In addition, McMahon currently faces four additional complaints to FINRA - which have yet to be resolved in a settlement or arbitration ruling - from clients he advised while working with National, the regulatorâs records show. McMahon denied any wrongdoing in several of the settled complaints. Haus - the customer who lost more than half a million dollars with McMahon and others at National - told Reuters that the ordeal made him contemplate suicide. âI was ashamed,â said the soybean farmer and U.S. military veteran. âI didnât want to tell anyone Iâm losing my life savings.â Haus settled his complaint against National in November for an undisclosed amount of money. The settlement required him to sign a nondisclosure agreement, and he has since not responded to Reutersâ inquiries. Hiring Opportunity In many cases, the firms identified by Reuters continue to operate after years of repeated run-ins with FINRA and other regulators. Take Los Angeles-based WestPark Capital Inc, where about half of the firmâs 95 brokers have FINRA flags on their records. More than 47 percent of WestPark brokers once worked at firms that were later expelled by FINRA. Regulators including FINRA and the New Jersey Bureau of Securities have sanctioned WestPark six times in the past 11 years for a variety of alleged violations. In 2004, FINRA suspended WestParkâs chief executive, Richard Rappaport, for 30 days from his management role and fined him and the firm $50,000 in response to allegations that WestPark omitted critical information from investment research reports and lacked supervisory controls. Without admitting wrongdoing, Rappaport agreed to the punishment in a settlement with FINRA. But he then ignored the suspension and continued to actively manage WestPark, according to FINRA disciplinary records reviewed by Reuters. His punishment for ignoring the 30-day suspension? Another 30-day suspension from FINRA and a $10,000 fine. In 2016, West Park saw a hiring opportunity. The firm started taking on dozens of brokers from Newport Coast Securities - a firm that FINRA banned from the industry that year for excessive trading in client accounts to rack up fees and for recommending unsuitable investments. Newport appealed the expulsion. By early 2017, WestPark had hired about 40 brokers from Newport Coast - including its former CEO, Richard Onesto. WestPark and Rappaport declined to comment. Onesto did not respond to requests for comment. Pump and Dump Another firm Reuters identified in its analysis - Windsor Street Capital - has been fined 12 times by FINRA since 2000 but may now face much stiffer penalties from the SEC. Fifty-eight percent of the firmâs 48 brokers had FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis. Over the years, FINRA fines have cost the firm about $300,000, and Windsor has appealed two other fines totaling more than $1 million. In January, the SEC brought administrative actions against Windsor Street Capital and its former anti-money laundering officer, John Telfer, for allegedly facilitating a $25 million pump-and-dump scheme - in which investors promote or âpumpâ the value of a dubious stock they own just before selling, or âdumpingâ it. Windsor declined to comment to Reuters but denied any misconduct in an SEC filing. The SEC alleges that Windsor allowed clients to sell hundreds of millions of unregistered penny stocks through Windsor brokerage accounts and did not report the suspicious transactions to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Windsor clients bought stock in dormant shell companies, spread false information to promote the companiesâ products and then dumped the shares as other investors bought in at inflated prices, the SEC alleges in a case that is still pending. Windsor made about $500,000 in commissions and fees from transactions related to the scheme, according to the SEC. When asked if FINRA investigators contributed to the SECâs investigation, an SEC official declined to comment and pointed to the agencyâs press release, which only credits SEC investigators. FINRA did not respond to requests for comment on whether it had a role in the Windsor investigation. âHappy New Year!â At Long Island-based Joseph Stone Capital, 71 percent of the firmsâ 59 brokers had FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis. Joseph Stone was investigated by the state of Montana after one of its sales representatives, Lawrence Sullivan, cold-called the office of Montanaâs Commissioner of Securities and Insurance to pitch an investment on January 15, 2016, according to a report on the incident by the regulator. The securities commission launched an investigation into the firm after the call, during which Sullivan quickly backtracked and denied he was pitching securities, according to the report. Reuters could not reach Sullivan for comment. The staffer he called - Patrick Navarro, an assistant analyst at the state regulator - did not respond to requests for comment. Investigators ultimately unearthed âfraudulent and unethicalâ practices, including excessive trading in client accounts - resulting in commissions totaling 28 percent of the $877,493 invested by clients in Montana, according to the regulatorâs report. The firm settled with the state on April 18, agreeing to pay $30,000 in restitution to clients without admitting wrongdoing. During the call that got the firm into trouble, Sullivan pitched Navarro on an investment in Paypal stock, the report said. After Navarro informed Sullivan that he worked for the stateâs securities regulator, Sullivan blurted out âHappy New Year!â and hung up.

Payments to the president's enterprises from foreign and domestic governments through his hospitality empire draw business away from Maryland and D.C. venues and put local governments under pressure to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment, according to the complaint.  Foreign and domestic government payments to Trump's businesses were the target of a similar lawsuit brought in January by plaintiffs including an ethics nonprofit group, and Democratic lawmakers have blasted them as potential corrupting influences on Trump. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require the customers to identify themselves.   Every time the president has spoken about drawing a line between his presidency and his businesses, heâs walked those promises back,  said D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said at a news conference on Monday. The case by Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, both Democrats, has a better chance in court as the first government action over allegations that Trump, a Republican, violated the Constitution's so-called emoluments clauses, legal experts said.  Democratic attorneys general have taken a lead role in challenging Trump policies, successfully blocking executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries.  The Maryland and D.C. attorneys general are seeking an order in U.S. District Court in Maryland preventing Trump from continuing to receive government payments beyond his salary.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday rejected the claim that Trump's business interests violated the Constitution and said  partisan politics  were behind the lawsuit. Trump's lawyers will likely move to dismiss the case, he said. The Justice Department declined to comment.  Trump's ownership in hundreds of businesses hurts Maryland and D.C. and violates  emoluments  clauses in the Constitution that bar the president from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval as well as from domestic governments under any circumstances, according to the  complaint.  Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine (R) hold a news conference to announce their lawsuit against U.S. President Donald Trump on the issue of the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clauses and Trump's business ventures, in Washington, DC, U.S. June 12, 2017.Jonathan ErnstWhile Trump turned over management of the umbrella Trump Organization in January to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, he still owns his businesses, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, and can draw revenue from them at any time. 'No Meaning Whatsoever' The attorneys general argued they had standing to sue Trump because their citizens will be harmed if payments to Trump are used to influence his allocation of federal funds. They also said local hospitality companies, including state-owned facilities, are being harmed.  Slideshow (6 Images)The Justice Department on Friday argued in the other lawsuit that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to sue because they cannot allege enough specific harm caused by Trump's businesses.  The attorneys general have a better chance of establishing standing, legal scholars said, although they are divided over whether the AGs will ultimately succeed. Plaintiffs typically only have standing to file lawsuits under federal law if they can show they have been injured and a court ruling would remedy the harm.  Fordham Law School Professor Jed Shugerman said state governments' special duty to protect their citizens means they face a lower bar to standing in federal court, and the AG lawsuit should proceed.  However, Derek Muller, a professor at Pepperdine University School of Law, said it was unclear that this harm could be remedied by a favorable ruling.  The government has also said Trump hotel revenue does not fit the definition of an improper payment under the Constitution. Payments to Trump's hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president, the government said. âIf the Justice Department is correct, the emoluments clause has no meaning whatsoever,â said Frosh, the Maryland official.  âThe president can stand over here with his president of the United States hat and heâs not allowed to take payments. But he takes a step over here and puts on his businessman hat, they can funnel as much money to him as they want.â Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco, Julia Harte in Washington and Jan Wolfe in New York; Editing by Michael Perry and Jeffrey Benkoe","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-lawsuit-idUSL1N1J90C6"},

Attorneys for Karim Baratov, a Canadian citizen born in Kazakhstan, had said at a bail hearing on Monday that evidence submitted by prosecutors suggested he played only a minor role in any plot but Justice J.A. Miller rejected that argument.  At the end of the day, Mr. Baratov remains a significant flight risk and is alleged to have committed a serious offence,  the ruling from Justice J.A.

Baratov was arrested in March on U.S. charges that he was paid to break into at least 80 email accounts by Russian intelligence agents who masterminded the 2014 theft of data from some 500 million Yahoo Inc YHOO.O user accounts. At the bail appeal hearing early this week, arguments focused on whether Baratov was merely a small-time hacker-for-hire or a key player in the scheme, the first time the U.S. government had criminally charged Russian spies for cyber offenses. Baratov's lawyers said the indictment only presented evidence of Baratov receiving $104.20 into his PayPal account from a Russian intelligence agent for breaking into seven email accounts.  Whether the applicant was paid nothing or was paid millions ... the alleged conduct remains a destabilizing attack on the integrity of systems that are vital to all of our wellbeing,  Miller wrote.

Trump,Kristen Clarke,Neil Gorsuch,USA,COURT/DEBT (UPDATE 4),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to widen the reach of a federal law targeting abusive debt-collection tactics such as harassment and threats, ruling it does not cover companies that buy debt, sometimes for pennies on the dollar, and then collect it. The justices, in a 9-0 ruling, upheld a lower court's dismissal of a proposed consumer class action lawsuit against Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc over allegations it violated a law called the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The ruling was the first authored by the court's newest justice, President Donald Trump's appointee Neil Gorsuch, who wrote that any changes to the law should come from the U.S. Congress, not the court. The law applies only to companies that collect money on behalf of others, not businesses like Santander that collect debt bought from other companies after it fell into default, the justices ruled. Santander, which said it was pleased with the ruling, is a Dallas-based consumer finance company specializing in car loans, owned in part by a subsidiary of Banco Santander, the euro zone's second-largest bank by market value. Four Maryland residents who had defaulted on car loans filed a proposed class action in 2012 in federal court, accusing Santander of violations of the debt collection law including misrepresenting debt loads and bypassing debtors' lawyers. Their debts had been sold to Santander, which then tried to collect on them. The plaintiffs' attorney, Cory Zajdel, said Monday's ruling is bad for consumers  as the Supreme Court has once again decided that big banks are above the law.  The $11.4 billion-dollar debt collection industry is one of the top sources of complaints to state attorneys general and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Forty-Year-Old Law The industry has evolved greatly since that law was enacted in 1977 to prohibit collectors from using abusive, unfair or deceptive practices to recoup money. In particular, companies that buy delinquent debt from the original lenders and then try to collect it from the borrowers now generate about a third of industry revenue. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lawsuit's dismissal last year, saying the law applied only to debt collectors, and Santander became a creditor when it purchased the loans. Creditors are not subject to the law. On Monday, Gorsuch wrote that the law does not distinguish between original lenders and debt buyers.  So a company collecting purchased default debt for its own account - like Santander - would hardly seem to be barred from qualifying as a creditor under the statute's plain terms,  Gorsuch wrote, adding that only Congress has the power to change that if lawmakers want to do so. The plaintiffs had claimed that if the law were to be interpreted in this way, unscrupulous debt collectors could evade the law merely by buying debt. Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said the ruling will lead to more debt buying as a means to circumvent the law. Its affects will be felt primarily among the poor and minorities who are  especially vulnerable  to abusive collection practices, she said. The plaintiffs were supported by a group of 28 states including Oregon and Florida as well as the District of Columbia, which said in legal papers that consumers see no difference between debt buyers and debt collectors and should be protected from unscrupulous tactics by both.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-debt-idUSL1N1J90IM"},

This week, the Trump administration backtracked, catching lawmakers off guard and alarming civil liberties advocates who say it is critical to know as Congress weighs changes to a law expiring at the end of the year that permits some of the National Security Agency's most sweeping espionage.  The NSA has made Herculean, extensive efforts to devise a counting strategy that would be accurate,  Dan Coats, a career Republican politician appointed by Republican President Donald Trump as the top U.S. intelligence official, testified to a Senate panel on Wednesday.  Coats said  it remains infeasible to generate an exact, accurate, meaningful, and responsive methodology that can count how often a U.S. person's communications may be collected  under the law known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He told the Senate Intelligence Committee that even if he dedicated more resources the NSA would not be able to calculate an estimate, which privacy experts have said could be in the millions. The statement ran counter to what senior intelligence officials had previously promised both publicly and in private briefings during the previous administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, lawmakers and congressional staffers working on drafting reforms to Section 702 said. Representative John Conyers, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said that for many months intelligence agencies  expressly promised  members of both parties to deliver the estimated number to them. Senior intelligence officials had also previously said an estimate could be delivered. In March, then NSA deputy director Rick Ledgett, said  yes  when asked by a Reuters reporter if an estimate would be provided this year.  Weâre working on that with the Congress and we'll come to a satisfactory resolution, because we have to,  said Ledgett, who has since retired from public service. The law allows U.S. intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on and collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside of the United States, but often incidentally scoops up communications of Americans. The decision to scrap the estimate is likely to complicate a  debate in Congress over whether to curtail certain aspects of the surveillance law, congressional aides said. Congress must vote to renew Section 702 to avoid its expiration on Dec. 31. Privacy issues often scramble traditional party lines, but there are signs that Section 702's renewal will be even more politically unpredictable. Some Republicans who usually support surveillance programs have expressed concerns about Section 702, in part because they are worried about leaks of intercepts of conversations between  Trump associates and Russian officials amid investigations of possible collusion. U.S. intelligence agencies last year accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign, allegations Moscow denies. Trump denies there was collusion. Intelligence officials have said Section 702 was not directly connected to surveillance related to those leaks.   As big a fan as I am of collection, incidental collection, I'm not going to reauthorize a program that could be politically manipulated,  Senator Lindsey Graham, usually a defender of U.S. surveillance activities, told reporters this week. Graham was among 14 Republican senators, including every Republican member of the intelligence panel, who on Tuesday introduced a bill supported by the White House and top intelligence chiefs, that would renew Section 702 without changes and make it permanent. Critics have called the process under which the FBI and other agencies can query the pool of data collected for U.S. information a  backdoor search loophole  that evades traditional warrant requirements.  How can we accept the government's reassurance that our privacy is being protected when the government itself has no idea how many Americans' communications are being swept up and stored?  said Liza Goitein, a privacy expert at the Brennan Center for Justice.

The attack, near the town of Baddah in oil-producing Hadramout province, came after a lull in attacks by the Islamist militant group's Yemeni affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Attackers set off two car bombs outside the camp, a military official said. Residents said they also heard gunfire after two loud explosions.   Our soldiers foiled the attack and managed to secure the camp and we are still pursuing those who have escaped in nearby farms,  the official told Reuters by phone. In its statement, al Qaeda said several  elite  troops were killed and vehicles destroyed, and that one of its fighters died. Al Qaeda took advantage of years of turmoil to build up one of its most active branches in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. It has been forced out of some areas in recent years by Yemen's army and allied Saudi-led coalition forces backing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in Yemen's civil war. But its militants have retreated to mountainous and desert areas and launch regular attacks on Yemeni troops and government facilities. The United States has launched two commando raids on al Qaeda forces in Yemen this year and stepped up drone attacks.

While neither Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein nor his Citi counterpart Michael Corbat revealed any sensitive information, the exchanges will raise questions about the way banks' computer systems handle emails to addresses outside their companies.  Blankfein was drawn into the simple hoax when he replied to an email purporting to be from his company's president and co-chief operating officer, Harvey Schwartz, congratulating him on a tweet that Blankfein wrote last week on a trip to China about the country's impressive infrastructure.    Tweet won some online award for humorous tweet - Trump will be so pissed ;)  the anonymous hoaxer, who used the Twitter handle @SINON_REBORN, said in a published exchange on the social media site pretending to be Schwartz.  Blankfein, who only recently joined Twitter, replied to whom he thought was Schwartz, saying he had tweeted when he landed in China because it  seemed like a good way to bookend my trip.  When asked about the incident, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York said:  In the aftermath of the elections in France and England, I would have thought Reuters had more consequential events to report on.   The prankster then attempted to draw in Corbat and Citi's head of global consumer banking, Stephen Bird, by masquerading as Citi's chairman Michael O'Neill.  Michael L. Corbat, president of the Citigroup, arrives at the Planalto Palace before a meeting with Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia April 9, 2013.Ueslei MarcelinoThe hoaxer sent Corbat and Bird an online article from British newspaper CityAM about the exchange between Blankfein and the emailer, according to the prankster's Twitter feed.   Corbat replied that he couldn't open the link.      Bird replied:  Can never be too careful Mike. Hope that's our real Chairman!  He then went on to describe Citi's email filtering system before commenting on Blankfein's mishap.   At least Lloyd was responsive ... in the new economy that's something. Some of his peers are still getting their messages printed out.   A spokeswoman for Citi in New York confirmed the existence of the email exchange but declined to comment further.  Due to concerns about hoaxing and security, a small group of the Wall Street elite refuses to say anything substantive in an email, text or chat, and some will not communicate digitally at all, Reuters reported in November. Last month, Barclays chief Jes Staley became the first high profile executive to be caught out by the prankster, and the bank reportedly responded by tightening its computer security so employees get a warning whenever they are sending messages to someone outside the firm. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney was also targeted and replied to an email he believed was from the head of the central bank's internal oversight body, Anthony Habgood. In his response, Carney poked fun at the drinking habits of one of his predecessors.

The technology sector rout dragged down all three major U.S. stock indexes and raised concerns about the market's lofty levels. The euro and its bonds rallied after pro-European parties scored in French and Italian elections over the weekend and as stocks jitters raised fresh questions for the Federal Reserve ahead of its policy meeting this week. The Nasdaq was down 0.8 percent after falling 1.8 percent on Friday. Apple was down 3.4 percent, though other tech heavyweights Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft also were down. At the same time, energy shares, which have had the biggest declines so far this year, added to Friday's gains. The S&P; energy index was up 0.8 percent.  You're seeing a rotation. You're seeing people not want to come out of the market. They're selling what's been a winner, rotating into what's been a loser because they want to stay in the market. That's not necessarily a bullish omen because when markets are at tops, people want to stay fully invested,  said Michael OâRourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. The S&P; technology index was down 1.3 percent on Monday, but remains up 17 percent for the year to date. The Apple-led worries had taken a heavy toll on Asian rivals including Samsung overnight and then hit Europe's big chipmakers STMicro and Dialog. An ebbing of the reflation trade that was based on U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and spending promises, and a run of negative U.S. economic surprises, have prompted some investors to review the mix of their portfolios. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 69.22 points, or 0.33 percent, to 21,202.75, the S&P; 500 had lost 8.23 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,423.54 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 51.39 points, or 0.83 percent, to 6,156.53. The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 1 percent. Oil gained on signs of inventory declines in the United States. News that Saudi Arabia will limit volumes of crude to some Asian buyers in July and deepen cuts to the United States also boosted prices. Brent crude futures rose 0.7 percent to $48.50 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures gained 1 percent to $46.29. In the foreign exchange market, Britainâs pound was under pressure, after falling more than 2 percent following last week's snap elections that left the Conservatives short of a ruling majority and cast a cloud of political uncertainty over the country. Sterling fell 0.55 percent to $1.2650. May's plans for leaving the EU have not changed, her spokesman said on Monday, although there were calls from Scotland to steer a course away from a  hard  Brexit. At the same time, first round French parliamentary election results look set to give President Emmanuel Macron a huge majority to push through pro-business reforms also helped. The dollar was steady with no major U.S. data releases and ahead of Wednesday's Fed meeting, at which the central bank is overwhelmingly expected to increase U.S. interest rates. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was little changed at 97.248. Benchmark 10-year Treasuries were last down 2/32 in price to yield 2.205 percent, from a yield of 2.199 percent late on Friday.

The justices, in a 9-0 ruling, upheld a lower court's dismissal of a proposed consumer class action lawsuit against Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc over allegations it violated a law called the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The ruling was the first authored by the court's newest justice, President Donald Trump's appointee Neil Gorsuch, who wrote that any changes to the law should come from the U.S. Congress, not the court. The law applies only to companies that collect money on behalf of others, not businesses like Santander that collect debt bought from other companies after it fell into default, the justices ruled. Santander, which said it was pleased with the ruling, is a Dallas-based consumer finance company specializing in car loans, owned in part by a subsidiary of Banco Santander, the euro zone's second-largest bank by market value. Four Maryland residents who had defaulted on car loans filed a proposed class action in 2012 in federal court, accusing Santander of violations of the debt collection law including misrepresenting debt loads and bypassing debtors' lawyers.  Their debts had been sold to Santander, which then tried to collect on them. The plaintiffs' attorney, Cory Zajdel, said Monday's ruling is bad for consumers  as the Supreme Court has once again decided that big banks are above the law.  The $11.4 billion-dollar debt collection industry is one of the top sources of complaints to state attorneys general and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Forty-Year-Old Law The industry has evolved greatly since that law was enacted in 1977 to prohibit collectors from using abusive, unfair or deceptive practices to recoup money. In particular, companies that buy delinquent debt from the original lenders and then try to collect it from the borrowers now generate about a third of industry revenue. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lawsuit's dismissal last year, saying the law applied only to debt collectors, and Santander became a creditor when it purchased the loans. Creditors are not subject to the law. On Monday, Gorsuch wrote that the law does not distinguish between original lenders and debt buyers.  So a company collecting purchased default debt for its own account - like Santander - would hardly seem to be barred from qualifying as a creditor under the statute's plain terms,  Gorsuch wrote, adding that only Congress has the power to change that if lawmakers want to do so. The plaintiffs had claimed that if the law were to be interpreted in this way, unscrupulous debt collectors could evade the law merely by buying debt. Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said the ruling will lead to more debt buying as a means to circumvent the law. Its affects will be felt primarily among the poor and minorities who are  especially vulnerable  to abusive collection practices, she said.  The plaintiffs were supported by a group of 28 states including Oregon and Florida as well as the District of Columbia, which said in legal papers that consumers see no difference between debt buyers and debt collectors and should be protected from unscrupulous tactics by both.

A technology sector rout extended to its second trading day on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite on track for its biggest two-day loss since September. The tech selling dragged down all three major indexes, causing concerns of wider bearishness in equities.  We're having a hard time deciding whether it's really a tech-specific sell-off or if this is a valuation pullback, so we're just holding pat right now,  said Scott Goginsky, a co-portfolio manager of the Biondo Growth Fund. However, investors took comfort that rather than totally abandoning equities, some were rotating into value sectors of the market. Losses were contained by a continuing rebound in energy and bank stocks.  The overall equity market health is reasonably good because people are rotating - they are not frantically getting out of stocks,  said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. Up nearly 14 percent since President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, the technology sector of the S&P; 500 had ballooned to its most expensive since early 2008 in terms of price to earnings expectations. Tech took over the market leadership from financials and other sectors that outperformed after the Nov. 8 presidential election on hopes that Trump's agenda of deregulation and tax cuts would benefit the sector. The five largest U.S. companies by market capitalization, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook added more than $600 billion in market cap in 2017 before the sell-off started, making some analysts wary of sector over-extension. The Technology Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund was down 1.1 percent Monday after having fallen as much as 2.2 percent - on track to post its largest two-day percentage decline in nearly a year. The decline was led by Apple, stung by a broker downgrade for a second straight week on Monday. The tech sell-off  is a reminder that markets that have full valuations are prone to quick reversals,  said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, which oversees more than $1.5 trillion in assets. The recent reversal in technology has given new life to the  value trade,  in which investors bet on large, undervalued companies and seek dividend payments. The iShares S&P; 500 value ETF is up more than 4 percent over the last two sessions. The fund's top holdings include Exxon Mobil, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan. At the same time, the technology rout has left some investors finding opportunities to add to their tech holdings at lower prices.  We're not worried at all about tech. We just think itâs a correction and a dip,  said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates , in Reno, Nevada.  Guys like me are net buyers right nowâ¦ It'll be fine.

Critics of Brexit have said the country's economy may  suffer if business and the public services cannot recruit the staff they need once the country leaves the European Union.   According to the Nursing and Midwifery Council data, a high of 1,304 EU nurses applied to work in Britain in July last year, shortly after Britain voted to leave the European Union.  That number fell to 344 in September and in April this year it was down to 46, it said. The council added that Britain had increasingly been using foreign nurses, mostly from the EU, to cover staff shortfalls over a decade. The BBC said the introduction of an English language test for EU nurses had also likely played a role in the reduction.   The findings should be a wake-up call to politicians and health service leaders,  said Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation.  The overall shortage of 30,000 nurses is not a shortage caused by the Brexit vote. The chronic shortage of nurses is the result of years of short-term planning and cuts to training places. A sustainable, long-term approach to workforce planning is desperately needed.

The other semi-final will pit Group B winners India against Group A runners-up Bangladesh at Edgbaston on Thursday. Pakistan looked to have thrown away their victory chance at several points on Monday as their batsmen's fallibility before the short-pitched ball prompted an astonishing collapse from 74-0 to 162-7. But captain Sarfraz Ahmed, who had already distinguished himself with two fine catches behind the stumps, steadied the innings, steering them home to 237-7 in the 45th over with a match-winning innings of 61 from 79 balls. At the other end, Mohammad Amir provided an equally valuable contribution, taking singles to rotate the strike as he reached an unbeaten 28. Their 75-run partnership was an eighth-wicket record for the Champions Trophy.  It is an unbelievable feeling. I just said to Amir play your normal game,  said Sarfraz who kissed the ground after hitting the winning runs. Even the captain suffered the occasional rush of blood, however, and was twice dropped on 38 and 40 by Thisara Perera and substitute fielder Seekkuge Prasanna off a disconsolate Lasith Malinga. The same bowler had also seen opener Azhar Ali spilled by Asela Gunaratne in his first over. For a while it hardly seemed to matter as excellent bowling from Malinga (1-52) and Nuwan Pradeep (3-60) ensured a regular procession of batsmen from the wicket. Earlier, Sri Lanka had suffered a collapse of their own as  superb left-arm pace bowling from Amir and Junaid Khan reduced Sri Lanka from 161-3 to 167-7 in four devastating overs. Charging in with great pace and guile, Amir removed danger man Angelo Mathews for 39 and opener Niroshan Dickwella, whose 73 had provided the base to Sri Lanka's innings. Junaid (3-40) added to the mid-order carnage as Sri Lanka, who had begun breezily to reach 82-1 from 14 overs, could do little more than see out their overs to post a disappointing 236 all out, with Hasan Ali also weighing in with 3-43.  Sri Lanka's total always looked below par, particularly after Pakistan pinch-hitter Fakhar Zaman smashed a quickfire 50 in 11 overs. But his departure without adding another run set the nerves jangling and by the end Pakistan were limping home.     Pakistan's semi-final will be their first meeting with England in a 50-over tournament since 2003 and their first knockout clash since they won the 1992 World Cup final.

Karl-Thomas Neumann, 56, who has restored Opel's image and reputation since taking the helm in March 2013, on Monday resigned from his post, making way for finance chief Michael Lohscheller to become the next CEO of the 155-year-old carmaker. German-based Opel will be pressed by its new owners PSA to draw up a plan to return to profit once the acquisition, agreed in March valuing the GM division at 2.2 billion euros ($2.46 billion), closes later this year.  Under Neumann's leadership we have made enormous progress in turning around Opel,  GM President Dan Ammann said. The U.S. parent's European business also includes British brand Vauxhall. VW is looking at rehiring Neumann, possibly to lead its Audi luxury division, where chief executive Rupert Stadler has come under fire for his handling of the emissions scandal, a source told Reuters on Sunday. A growing expansion by VW group into electric cars and digital services as part of a post-dieselgate strategic shift could be another reason to join for Neumann, a trained electronic engineer, analysts said.  The prospects are good that he will move to Volkswagen,  said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper.  He's one of Germany's most distinguished car managers and VW is in great need for excellent people.  Lasting Profit FILE PHOTO: Karl-Thomas Neumann, chief executive of Adam Opel AG, gives a speech during a ceremony as the 3rd million car produced at the Opel plant is presented in Eisenach, April 23, 2014.Fabrizio Bensch/File PhotoPSA wants Opel to return to lasting profit no later than by 2020 with operating margin goals of 2 percent that year and even around 6 percent by 2026 - a target never achieved under Neumann whose push for profitability was hampered by a weak Russian market and effects of Britain's Brexit decision.  We will vigorously proceed along the agreed path and gain more clout as part of the PSA group,  Lohscheller said.     Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported on Saturday that while Neumann views the sale to PSA as the right strategic step, he is concerned that the new owner is underestimating the growing importance of electric cars.  These comments are interesting given we have previously noted our concerns around PSA's lack of investment in key future trends,  said London-based Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst. PSA only came eighth in a top-ten ranking compiled by Evercore of carmakers based on average R&D; spending between 2014-2016, lagging rivals such as Ford (F.N), Renault (RENA.PA) and leader Volkswagen where Neumann was formerly in charge of group-wide electronics research. Neumann said on Twitter he will stay as member of Opel's management board until the closing of the acquisition by PSA. When he lost his post as head of VW's vast operations in China in 2012, sources at the carmaker said at the time he was too aspiring for the then-CEO Martin Winterkorn.  VW boss (Matthias) Mueller has a more open leadership style that is not authoritarian,  Pieper said.  That would facilitate Neumann's return.   Reporting by Andreas Cremer.

With British politics thrust into the deepest turmoil since last June's shock Brexit vote, EU leaders were left wondering how the divorce talks would open next week. Despite her party's expectations of a landslide victory, May lost her majority in parliament, pushing her into rushed talks on a support agreement with a small eurosceptic Northern Irish Protestant party with 10 parliamentary seats. May faced Conservative party lawmakers at a meeting of its 1922 Committee. Despite anger at the election, she was cheered briefly at the start of the meeting.  She said 'I'm the person who got us into this mess and I'm the one who is going to get us out of it,'  said one Conservative lawmaker who attended.  She said she will serve us as long as we want her.  Lawmakers, who are by tradition not named at such meetings, told Reuters that there were no dissenting voices and that the party had no appetite for a leadership election. May appeared contrite, sought to apologize for her failed election gamble and gave an explanation of what went wrong. While some members of her party have said she will have to go eventually, May is expected to stay on as prime minister at least for now. May has promised to start the formal Brexit talks next week but her authority has collapsed since the election result and  opponents took her woes as a chance to push back against her Brexit strategy. During the campaign, May cast herself as the only leader competent enough to navigate the tortuous Brexit negotiations that will shape the future of the United Kingdom and its $2.5 trillion economy. At the meeting with lawmakers in Parliament, May recognized that a broader consensus needed to be built for Brexit and made clear that she would listen to all wings of the party on the issue. She mocked Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a socialist, as incompetent and unrealistic, but his electoral campaign energized the youth vote and wiped out the Conservatives' majority in parliament. Related CoverageWith a 'stonking performance', Britain's May wins stay of executionUK PM May said wants broader consensus on Brexit plan: lawmakerUK's Hammond says hopes investors will bide time for clarity on governmentMay plans a clean break from the EU, involving withdrawal from Europe's single market and customs union and limits on immigration from the EU. May's Brexit?  Her spokesman insisted her position on Brexit remained unchanged but Scottish Conservatives were pushing for her to move the focus onto economic growth and away from immigration, sources in the Scottish branch of the party said. EU talks might not begin on June 19 as expected, Brexit minister David Davis said and the Queen's Speech, due on the same day in which the government traditionally spells out its policy plans, has also been delayed, the BBC reported. May wants to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU before Britain leaves in March 2019, followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of the divorce. But her election failure means she must now go into Britain's most complex negotiations since World War Two with her eye firmly on the different factions within her Conservative Party, which has been divided over EU membership for a generation. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband Phillip arrive at church in Sonning, Britain June 11, 2017.Stefan WermuthOpponents of a sharp break include Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives. who helped the party win 12 more seats in Scotland in contrast to losses elsewhere. She has called for a closer relationship with the EU after Brexit.  There can be changes in the offer of Brexit as we go forward,  Davidson told reporters in London after meeting May.  What's clear is that there is going to be a real imperative on the economic impact of Brexit, to make sure that Brexit works for the whole country, to make that we're able to pursue free trade,  Davidson said.[L8N1J923P] May's spokesman said it remained government policy to cut net migration to under 100,000 and Brexit Minister David Davis also said walking away without securing a deal with the remaining 27 EU states remained a possibility. While Britons voted by 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in last year's referendum, Scots strongly backed staying in the bloc and  Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister in Scotland's devolved assembly, said a so-called Hard Brexit was  dead in the water . Ratings agency Moody's and Irish Prime Minister-designate Leo Varadkar also said the election made the opportunity of a  Soft Brexit  more likely, but Davis downplayed the chances of Britain staying in the single market. Prime Minister May?  Before the government can do anything it must finalize a deal with the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). May is due to meet its leader Arlene Foster on Tuesday.  In an article in the Belfast Telegraph, Foster listed three priorities, including getting Northern Ireland's devolved power-sharing government at Stormont working again.  We stood on a clear policy platform of wanting to strengthen the Union, of working for a good deal for Northern Ireland as the United Kingdom leaves the EU, and of promising to do our best to get Stormont up and running again for the benefit of all,  Foster wrote.  We will use the position we find ourselves in to do as we promised.  Davis, who said that some policies in the government's program would now be pruned back, was one of a number of senior Conservatives to publicly pledge loyalty to May. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is touted as the favorite to replace May should she be forced out, called on colleagues to rally behind her. However, George Osborne, a former finance minister who is now editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper and a vocal critic of May, said she appeared a  dead woman walking . Britain's descent into political crisis just days before the Brexit talks begin has sapped confidence amongst business leaders and infuriated bosses who were already grappling with the fallout from the vote to leave the EU.  The uncertainty has hit business confidence, according to a survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD). It found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence from its last survey in May. The pound slid to its lowest level for nearly two months after the vote, but the fall was much less severe than the one sparked by the Brexit vote in June 2016. On Monday, the currency was under pressure once again.    The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,  said a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100, speaking on condition of anonymity.   That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election. That has really profound implications for multinational businesses that have made a long-term bet on London being the sensible place to base themselves.

Halyard has retained investment bank Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) to run a sale process for the surgical and infection prevention business, the people said. There is no guarantee that the process will result in any deal, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Halyard Health and Deutsche Bank did not immediately respond to requests to comment. Headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, Halyard has a market capitalization of $1.7 billion. The company operates 11 manufacturing facilities across several countries and employs about 12,700 people.   The surgical and infection prevention unit for sale is Halyard's largest business by revenue, notching about $1 billion in sales last year, but it has also been a drag on the company's growth, seeing sales shrink year over year.  In its most recent quarter, Halyard reported that sales in its surgical and infectious diseases business declined by 3 percent because of falling prices.

Karl-Thomas Neumann, 56, who has restored Opel's image and reputation since taking the helm in March 2013, on Monday resigned from his post, making way for finance chief Michael Lohscheller to become the next CEO of the 155-year-old carmaker. German-based Opel will be pressed by its new owners PSA to draw up a plan to return to profit once the acquisition, agreed in March valuing the GM division at 2.2 billion euros ($2.46 billion), closes later this year.  Under Neumann's leadership we have made enormous progress in turning around Opel,  GM President Dan Ammann said. The U.S. parent's European business also includes British brand Vauxhall. VW is looking at rehiring Neumann, possibly to lead its Audi luxury division, where chief executive Rupert Stadler has come under fire for his handling of the emissions scandal, a source told Reuters on Sunday. A growing expansion by VW group into electric cars and digital services as part of a post-dieselgate strategic shift could be another reason to join for Neumann, a trained electronic engineer, analysts said.  The prospects are good that he will move to Volkswagen,  said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper.  He's one of Germany's most distinguished car managers and VW is in great need for excellent people.  Lasting Profit FILE PHOTO: Karl-Thomas Neumann, chief executive of Adam Opel AG, gives a speech during a ceremony as the 3rd million car produced at the Opel plant is presented in Eisenach, April 23, 2014.Fabrizio Bensch/File PhotoPSA wants Opel to return to lasting profit no later than by 2020 with operating margin goals of 2 percent that year and even around 6 percent by 2026 - a target never achieved under Neumann whose push for profitability was hampered by a weak Russian market and effects of Britain's Brexit decision.  We will vigorously proceed along the agreed path and gain more clout as part of the PSA group,  Lohscheller said.     Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported on Saturday that while Neumann views the sale to PSA as the right strategic step, he is concerned that the new owner is underestimating the growing importance of electric cars.  These comments are interesting given we have previously noted our concerns around PSA's lack of investment in key future trends,  said London-based Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst. PSA only came eighth in a top-ten ranking compiled by Evercore of carmakers based on average R&D; spending between 2014-2016, lagging rivals such as Ford (F.N), Renault (RENA.PA) and leader Volkswagen where Neumann was formerly in charge of group-wide electronics research. Neumann said on Twitter he will stay as member of Opel's management board until the closing of the acquisition by PSA. When he lost his post as head of VW's vast operations in China in 2012, sources at the carmaker said at the time he was too aspiring for the then-CEO Martin Winterkorn.  VW boss (Matthias) Mueller has a more open leadership style that is not authoritarian,  Pieper said.  That would facilitate Neumann's return.   Reporting by Andreas Cremer.

The EU's European Commission will say on Tuesday that it wants a new system to vet whether, and under what conditions, non-EU clearing houses should be allowed to handle large volumes of euro-denominated business, the FT said, citing a document. A clearing house stands between two sides of a trade to ensure its smooth and safe completion. The bulk of clearing in euro-denominated derivatives is done in London, but euro zone policymakers have objected to this, saying that after Britain leaves the EU in 2019 they would have little say over an activity they see as core to euro zone stability. The draft law will need approval from EU states and the European Parliament. The draft legislation says the bloc's watchdog, the European Securities and Markets Authority, or ESMA, could agree with EU central banks that a particular clearing house is of  substantial systemic significance , the FT said. The Commission would then decide if the clearing house would need to relocate activities to the EU if it wants the regulatory approvals needed to operate in the EU single market. The draft law does not seek a specific cap on the amount of euro clearing that can take place outside the bloc, the FT said. Most euro-denominated clearing of derivatives is done by a unit of the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), whose head said on Monday that relocation would have little financial impact as it has a clearing house in Paris that is fully authorized under EU rules. A global derivatives industry body warned on Monday that shifting clearing of euro-denominated derivatives from London to the European continent would require banks to set aside far more cash to insure trades against defaults, a cost that would be passed on to companies.

Cries from a cub were heard shortly before noon and it was seen on a monitor soon after.

The companies ended their support of the production by the nonprofit Public Theater on Sunday. The move came hours after Trump's son Donald Jr. in a tweet questioned whether it was art or political speech.  Disappointed in @Delta for turning its back on free expression. I've flown many thousands of miles with you. No more,  Beau Willimon, an American playwright and creator of the popular Netflix series  House of Cards,  wrote on Twitter. Novelist Joyce Carol Oates tweeted that she would see the play  in thrilled defiance of ignorant would-be censors.  Actor Ron Perlman, known for his big screen depiction of  Hellboy,  also condemned the two ex-sponsors.  Act accordingly,  Perlman told his followers on Twitter. Delta Air Lines Inc and Bank of America Corp also received support on social media.  Kudos to @Delta for pulling $$ from 'play' portraying assassination of @POTUS. No one should sponsor crap like that!  former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, a Republican whose daughter is deputy White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter. It was not immediately clear why the companies withdrew their support more than two weeks after the play opened on May 23 as part of its Shakespeare in the Park program in Manhattan's Central Park. Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment. The Public Theater did not respond immediately for comment.  I wonder how much of this 'art' is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does 'art' become political speech & does that change things?,  Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter on Sunday morning after seeing a Fox News story about the play. Author and journalist Summer Brennan said adapting Shakespeare's work to different eras was a longstanding theatrical tradition. She said she had seen of the 16th century playwright's pieces set in different eras, including World War One and Two, the American West, a health spa, and in outer space.  Setting Shakespearean political tragedies and history plays in current or recent administrations is an important tradition. #DontBanTheBard,  Brennan wrote on Twitter on Monday. American Express Co, which calls itself  the official card of The Public Theater,  said on Monday it did not support this version of  Julius Caesar,  but did not say if it would drop funding.  The Public Theater puts on many shows. Our sponsorship does not go toward the funding of the production of Shakespeare in the Park and we do not condone this interpretation of the play,  American Express said in a statement. Delta and Bank of American ended their sponsorships less than 12 days after comedian Kathy Griffin faced a backlash after posing for a photograph with a fake severed and bloodied head resembling Trump. After images were published on social media, Griffin lost sponsorships and jobs, including co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.

IMF head Christine Lagarde suggested a plan last week under which the Fund would join the Greek bailout now, because Athens is delivering on agreed reforms, but would not disburse any IMF money until the euro zone clarifies what debt relief it can offer Greece. Underlining the IMF's willingness to strike a deal after months of wrangling between its European chief Poul Thomsen and the euro zone, Lagarde will attend the ministers' meeting. IMF participation in the bailout, even without immediate disbursements, would be enough for the German parliament to back new euro zone loans to Athens, thus ensuring Greece would get  enough cash in July to repay maturing debt and avoid default.  Everyone thinks there is a high probability we will end up with the solution Lagarde outlined,  an official involved in preparations for Thursday's meeting in Luxembourg said. A second official involved in the preparations also said he expected a deal involving IMF participation along the lines described by Lagarde.  There would be an IMF disbursement as soon as there is more clarity on debt, but the timing of that is to be confirmed,  the second official said. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (L) meets with French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire at his office in Maximos Mansion in Athens, Greece, June 12, 2017.Costas BaltasGreece's parliament approved last Friday reforms demanded by the international lenders to conclude a long-stalled review of its bailout progress and qualify for more loans before July. Euro zone officials said that if the expected compromise is reached, Greece could get between 7.4 and 8 billion euros from the euro zone bailout fund ESM to cover next month's repayments. The IMF has so far refused to join Greece's bailout, its third since 2010, which it says must be the country's last, meaning that in addition to Athens making reforms, the euro zone must offer relief to help make Greece's debts sustainable. Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos welcomes his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire at the Ministry of Finance in Athens, Greece, June 12, 2017.Costas BaltasBut Berlin does not want to discuss any details of debt relief for Greece before German parliamentary elections in September. At the same time, the German parliament has asked for IMF participation if it is to agree to any new disbursements. To complicate matters further, the IMF and the euro zone differ substantially on forecasts for Greek growth for decades ahead and on Athens' ability to achieve high primary surpluses to help it service its debt.  The IMF is much more conservative than the euro zone, saying Greece has a track record of underperforming targets set in its bailouts. It says that to expect the country to keep a high primary surplus for decades is unrealistic. But some euro zone scenarios show that with sufficiently high economic growth and fiscal discipline -- a primary surplus above 3 percent of GDP for 20 years -- Greece would not need any extra debt relief. To bridge the gap, France is proposing to link debt relief to Greece's GDP growth with an automatic formula. Officials said experts would explore that option further, but its chances of success are seen as rather low because of lack of experience, problems with incentives and the Greek constitution.

Critics of Brexit have said the country's economy may  suffer if business and the public services cannot recruit the staff they need once the country leaves the European Union.   According to the Nursing and Midwifery Council data, a high of 1,304 EU nurses applied to work in Britain in July last year, shortly after Britain voted to leave the European Union.  That number fell to 344 in September and in April this year it was down to 46, it said. The council added that Britain had increasingly been using foreign nurses, mostly from the EU, to cover staff shortfalls over a decade. The BBC said the introduction of an English language test for EU nurses had also likely played a role in the reduction.   The findings should be a wake-up call to politicians and health service leaders,  said Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation.  The overall shortage of 30,000 nurses is not a shortage caused by the Brexit vote. The chronic shortage of nurses is the result of years of short-term planning and cuts to training places.

The divestment would allow Halyard to shift its focus away from commoditized hospital products, such as sterilization wrap, surgical drapes and gowns, and concentrate on its medical devices business, focused largely on post-operative pain management. Halyard has retained investment bank Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) to run a sale process for the surgical and infection prevention business, the people said. There is no guarantee that the process will result in any deal, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Halyard Health and Deutsche Bank did not immediately respond to requests to comment. Headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, Halyard has a market capitalization of $1.7 billion. The company operates 11 manufacturing facilities across several countries and employs about 12,700 people.   The surgical and infection prevention unit for sale is Halyard's largest business by revenue, notching about $1 billion in sales last year, but it has also been a drag on the company's growth, seeing sales shrink year over year.  In its most recent quarter, Halyard reported that sales in its surgical and infectious diseases business declined by 3 percent because of falling prices. Meanwhile, its medical devices business gained 15 percent during the same period.  In 2016, Halyard acquired Corpak MedSystems for $174 from buyout firm Linden Capital Partners.

Crystallex in 2016 won an award of $1.2 billion plus interest from a World Bank Tribunal. In March, it won a ruling by a U.S. District of Columbia court upholding that award, a crucial step in being able to seize Venezuelan assets in the United States. Crystallex can now seek to enforce the ruling in other U.S. jurisdictions, the same District of Columbia court said in a decision dated Friday. This could allow Crystallex to seek an attachment of assets such as Citgo, a refining and marketing subsidiary of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA. Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to an email seeking comment. Crystallex this year asked a U.S. court for an injunction against PDVSA, arguing that it carried out $2.8 billion in operations involving Citgo and pledged Citgo shares to Russian oil firm Rosneft as a guarantee for a loan. Crystallex called those operations an effort to block it from collecting compensation. Venezuela, which is struggling under triple-digit inflation and a severe recession, is immersed in nearly 20 arbitration disputes with foreign companies resulting mainly from a wave of state takeovers by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. It has reached negotiated settlements to some of the disputes, but companies that have won International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes awards have not been able to collect on them due to frequent appeals and the complexity of attaching Venezuelan assets.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.     May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a  hard Brexit  -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.  Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.   The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,  a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.   That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.   A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.  The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.   It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could â if not addressed immediately â be disastrous for the UK economy,  said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.  The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year's Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.  Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year's Brexit vote.  And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.  Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.  Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a 'softer Brexit', with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.   Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn't think used to happen in the UK,  CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.   But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.   Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.  Left in Limbo  Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.  Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.  Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britainâs biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered  uncharted waters  in terms of how many new cars it could sell.  And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world's largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant  weak investment and postponement of decision making.    Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,  he said.  Bankers, at the heart of London's huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.   So long as uncertainty is there I don't see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,  Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.  Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.   I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.

Emil Michael, senior vice president and a close Kalanick ally, has left the company, the source said. At the Sunday meeting, the company's board adopted a series of recommendations from the law firm of former U.S Attorney General Eric Holder following a sprawling, multi-month investigation into Uber's culture and practices, according to a board representative. Uber will tell employees about the recommendations on Tuesday, said the representative, who declined to be identified. Holder and his law firm were retained by Uber in February to investigate company practices after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post detailing what she described as sexual harassment and the lack of a suitable response by senior managers. The recommendations in Holder's firm's report force greater controls on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Kalanick have had a surprising amount of autonomy for a company with more than 12,000 employees, a source familiar with the matter said. The world's most valuable venture-backed private company has found itself at a crossroads as its rough-and-tumble approach to local regulations and handling employees and drivers has led to a series of problems. It is facing a criminal probe by the U.S. Department of Justice over its use of a software tool that helped its drivers evade local transportation regulators, sources have told Reuters. Last week, Uber said it fired 20 staff after another law firm looked into 215 cases encompassing sexual harassment, discrimination, unprofessional behavior, bullying and other employee complaints. Silicon Valley Shock Even a temporary departure by Kalanick would be a shock for the Silicon Valley startup world, where company founders in recent years have enjoyed more autonomy and often become synonymous with their firms. Uber's image, culture and practices have been largely defined by Kalanick's brash approach, company insiders and investors previously told Reuters. Uber board member Arianna Huffington said in March that Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a  scrappy entrepreneur  to be more like a  leader of a major global company.  The board has been looking for a chief operating officer to help Kalanick run the company since March. The debate over Kalanick's future comes at a moment when he is also facing a personal trauma: His mother died last month in a boating accident, in which his father was also badly injured. Michael, described by employees as Kalanick's closest deputy, has been a recurring flashpoint for controversy at the company. He once discussed hiring private investigators to probe the personal lives of reporters writing stories faulting the company. Kalanick disavowed and publicly criticized the comments. Alongside Uber's management crisis, its self-driving car program is in jeopardy after a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc alleging trade secrets theft, and the company has suffered an exodus of top executives. One Uber investor called the board's decisions on Sunday a step in the right direction, giving Uber an  opportunity to reboot.

Gallatin County Judge Rick West sentenced Gianforte to 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management classes. The judge in Bozeman, Montana, also handed down a six-month deferred jail sentence, which Gianforte would avoid serving if he complies with the court's orders.

The EU's European Commission will say on Tuesday that it wants a new system to vet whether, and under what conditions, non-EU clearing houses should be allowed to handle large volumes of euro-denominated business, the FT said, citing a document. A clearing house stands between two sides of a trade to ensure its smooth and safe completion. The bulk of clearing in euro-denominated derivatives is done in London, but euro zone policymakers have objected to this, saying that after Britain leaves the EU in 2019 they would have little say over an activity they see as core to euro zone stability. The draft law will need approval from EU states and the European Parliament. The draft legislation says the bloc's watchdog, the European Securities and Markets Authority, or ESMA, could agree with EU central banks that a particular clearing house is of  substantial systemic significance , the FT said. The Commission would then decide if the clearing house would need to relocate activities to the EU if it wants the regulatory approvals needed to operate in the EU single market. The draft law does not seek a specific cap on the amount of euro clearing that can take place outside the bloc, the FT said. Most euro-denominated clearing of derivatives is done by a unit of the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), whose head said on Monday that relocation would have little financial impact as it has a clearing house in Paris that is fully authorized under EU rules. A global derivatives industry body warned on Monday that shifting clearing of euro-denominated derivatives from London to the European continent would require banks to set aside far more cash to insure trades against defaults, a cost that would be passed on to companies.

IMF head Christine Lagarde suggested a plan last week under which the Fund would join the Greek bailout now, because Athens is delivering on agreed reforms, but would not disburse any IMF money until the euro zone clarifies what debt relief it can offer Greece. Underlining the IMF's willingness to strike a deal after months of wrangling between its European chief Poul Thomsen and the euro zone, Lagarde will attend the ministers' meeting. IMF participation in the bailout, even without immediate disbursements, would be enough for the German parliament to back new euro zone loans to Athens, thus ensuring Greece would get  enough cash in July to repay maturing debt and avoid default.  Everyone thinks there is a high probability we will end up with the solution Lagarde outlined,  an official involved in preparations for Thursday's meeting in Luxembourg said. A second official involved in the preparations also said he expected a deal involving IMF participation along the lines described by Lagarde.  There would be an IMF disbursement as soon as there is more clarity on debt, but the timing of that is to be confirmed,  the second official said. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (L) meets with French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire at his office in Maximos Mansion in Athens, Greece, June 12, 2017.Costas BaltasGreece's parliament approved last Friday reforms demanded by the international lenders to conclude a long-stalled review of its bailout progress and qualify for more loans before July. Euro zone officials said that if the expected compromise is reached, Greece could get between 7.4 and 8 billion euros from the euro zone bailout fund ESM to cover next month's repayments. The IMF has so far refused to join Greece's bailout, its third since 2010, which it says must be the country's last, meaning that in addition to Athens making reforms, the euro zone must offer relief to help make Greece's debts sustainable. Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos welcomes his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire at the Ministry of Finance in Athens, Greece, June 12, 2017.Costas BaltasBut Berlin does not want to discuss any details of debt relief for Greece before German parliamentary elections in September. At the same time, the German parliament has asked for IMF participation if it is to agree to any new disbursements. To complicate matters further, the IMF and the euro zone differ substantially on forecasts for Greek growth for decades ahead and on Athens' ability to achieve high primary surpluses to help it service its debt.  The IMF is much more conservative than the euro zone, saying Greece has a track record of underperforming targets set in its bailouts. It says that to expect the country to keep a high primary surplus for decades is unrealistic. But some euro zone scenarios show that with sufficiently high economic growth and fiscal discipline -- a primary surplus above 3 percent of GDP for 20 years -- Greece would not need any extra debt relief. To bridge the gap, France is proposing to link debt relief to Greece's GDP growth with an automatic formula. Officials said experts would explore that option further, but its chances of success are seen as rather low because of lack of experience, problems with incentives and the Greek constitution.

Immelt,John Flannery,Kieran Murphy,GE,CEO/FLANNERY,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - When John Flannery was chosen to head GE Healthcare in 2014, his background as chief dealmaker for the industrial conglomerate led to speculation GE might consider spinning off its somewhat sickly health business. In fact, he has nursed it back to improving sales and profits by focusing primarily on organic growth opportunities, and the business remains core to GE. Flannery will take over General Electric Co from Jeff Immelt, who is stepping aside after 16 years as head of the conglomerate he helped steer through the financial crisis but which is now worth a third less than when he took over. On Flannery's watch, the healthcare unit - best-known for imaging and diagnostics - has also expanded into life sciences, offering a range of services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies. GE faces tough competition for its medical imaging machines, which include MRI scanners and ultrasound devices, from rivals including Philips and Siemens, as well as younger Asian upstarts. But a focus on expansion into new markets has helped lift sales at GE Healthcare to $18.3 billion last year, with organic revenue increasing by 5 percent and margins by 100 basis points. Flannery has worked hard to move GE into newer areas of healthcare like life sciences, where GE has emerged as a significant player in helping with the production of biological drugs and cell therapies. Such drugs, given by injection or infusion, are a pivotal driver of innovation in the drugs industry, being used to treat complex diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer. Flannery told Reuters last year he aimed to  double down on life sciences , given this business's large and high-margin opportunities. One of the more innovative ideas launched by GE recently is the design of prefabricated drug factories for making complex biotech medicines, an idea it is pioneering in both China and Ireland. GE reckons its  off-the-shelf  modular factories are 25 to 50 percent cheaper than the traditional plants and can be constructed in just 18 months rather than the typical three years. Some analysts continue to question whether healthcare truly fits with mainstay GE industries like power generation and jet engines, but Flannery's elevation suggests the group is not contemplating ditching healthcare any time soon. In a sign of continuity, GE said Kieran Murphy, who currently heads life sciences, would lead the wider GE Healthcare division - and the company stated bluntly:  Healthcare is a key GE business now and in the future.

The Trump administration on June 1 asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the Hawaii and Richmond rulings and revive the ban. Hawaii federal Judge Derrick Watson blocked a March 6 executive order barring travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the government put in place stricter visa screening. Watson also blocked a directive that suspended entry of refugee applicants for 120 days, as well as other instructions for the government to study tougher vetting procedures. The 9th Circuit on Monday upheld the block on Trump's travel ban and a cap on refugees. However, the appeals court vacated part of the injunction in order to allow the government to conduct internal reviews on vetting.

Trump,Kelley Davenport,USA,COURT/BIOLOGICS (UPDATE 4),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday cut the time it will take for copycat versions of biologic drugs to get to the market in a pivotal ruling about an expensive class of medicines that can yield billions of dollars in sales for drug companies. The justices, in a 9-0 ruling, overturned a lower court's decision that had prevented Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG from selling its copycat version of California-based Amgen Inc's Neupogen until six months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it. The decision has major implications for the pharmaceutical industry because it will dictate how long brand-name makers of biologic drugs can keep near-copies, called biosimilars, off the market. Even the six months at issue in the case can mean hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. Health insurers expect biosimilars to be cheaper than original brands, like generics, saving consumers billions of dollars each year. Novartis said in a statement that the ruling  will help expedite patient access to life-enhancing treatments.  Amgen spokeswoman Kelley Davenport said the company was disappointed but  will continue to seek to enforce our intellectual property against those parties that infringe upon our rights.  The dispute involved a section of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, that created an expedited path for regulatory approval of biosimilars while trying to respect the patent rights of brand-name manufacturers. Novartis complained that the 2015 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington handed Amgen an extra six months of exclusivity on top of the 12 years already provided under the law. Rising drug prices are a matter of concern for patients and policymakers. President Donald Trump has criticized the pharmaceutical industry over pricing practices, promising to encourage competition and bring down drug costs. Living Cells Unlike traditional drugs, biologics are made from living cells and cannot be copied exactly to make generic versions. They are used to treat a range of conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, breast cancer and diabetes. Novartis unit Sandoz in September 2015 began selling Zarxio, the first biosimilar drug to win U.S. regulatory approval. Amgen's Neupogen and Zarxio boost white blood cell counts in cancer patients to help fight infections. After launch, Zarxio cost 15 percent less than Neupogen at list prices, according to Novartis. Sales of Neupogen, meanwhile, dropped from more than $1 billion in 2015 to $765 million last year, primarily due to competition in the United States, the company said in regulatory filings. Biologics account for an ever-increasing share of U.S. prescription drug costs, according to an insurer trade group. It cited as an example AbbVie Inc's Humira, which costs more than $50,000 per year. Amgen sued Sandoz in 2014 in San Francisco federal court alleging patent infringement and violations of the Affordable Care Act provision governing biosimilars. The companies disagreed on how to apply that law's requirement that a biosimilar drug maker give the brand-name manufacturer 180 days notice before launching its copycat version. In July 2015, the appeals court ruled that the 180-day notice must be given after FDA approval, a ruling the Supreme Court reversed on Monday. Writing for the court, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the decision was not based on policy arguments, but rather, the  plain language  of the biosimilar law itself. The Trump administration had backed Novartis' arguments in the case.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-biologics-idUSL1N1J90LN"},

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties a week ago, accusing Doha of backing terrorism.  Kuwait's foreign minister is making efforts to mediate between our countries. We support this effort and our choice is resolve this through dialogue,  Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told reporters in Paris after meeting his French counterpart.  But there are other problems that need to solved and it seems that they are trying to destroy Qatar. That doesn't seem to be very timely.  Speaking amid a tour of European capitals to gauge support among Doha's traditional allies, Sheikh Mohammed said there was  no proof  to accusations that his country financed terrorist groups, supported the Muslim Brotherhood and the Palestinian group Hamas and had close ties with Iran.  We still have no clue what is behind these measures,  he said.  Whatever is related to the collective security of the Gulf countries, Qatar is ready to negotiate ... but we have the right to react to these accusations that we are interfering in their internal affairs.  Our foreign policy is subject to the sovereignty of our country and is based on our own assessment and our own principles.  The campaign to isolate Qatar is disrupting trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food. It also raises the prospect of a shock to the global gas market, where the Gulf state is a major participant. The Arab states have also accused Doha of undermining other Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority with its backing of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. Sheikh Mohammed said the allegations on the Muslim Brotherhood were  false  and that it did not understand why it needed to cut ties with Hamas, since it was a resistance movement and not a terrorist group. He said European countries, including France, were trying to ease tensions in support of Kuwait's mediation efforts, and he believed that the United States, which was also backing mediation, wanted restrictions on Doha to be lifted.  We in Qatar are prepared to engage in dialogue positively, but in accordance with the international norms and standards that govern any dialogue as per international law,  Sheikh Mohammed said.

Coury,Scott Stringer,MYLAN,BOARD/ (UPDATE 2),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Influential proxy firm ISS on Monday turned up the heat on Mylan NV, advising its institutional clients to voice their dissatisfaction with the generic drugmaker's board of directors and its chairman's pay package at its June 22 shareholder meeting. ISS's urged votes against 10 board members and executive pay packages, recommendations that come after a small group of high-profile investors, including the state and city of New York pension funds and the California teachers pension fund, urged other shareholders to vote against six board members and Chairman Robert Coury. It cited Mylan's eroding reputation and share price. Like the investors, ISS said shareholder value had eroded as the board mismanaged the situation around the company's life saving EpiPen treatment, whose sharp price increases spurred congressional, Justice Department and other government investigations into Medicaid overcharging. It is likely the vote will not require Mylan to change its board or pay structure. ISS, which advises institutional shareholders on how to vote, said unseating a director requires two-thirds of votes cast at a general meeting. Also, no candidates have been named as replacements. Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement, âWe are confident that our shareholders recognize that this board has overseen a period of strong and sustainable long-term growth, and that the recommendation and rationale to remove the board and leave the company without any leadership is simply irrational and not in shareholders' best interests.â Mylan shares were down 2.5 percent on Monday at $39.07, or less than half of the $82 per share that Teva International said publicly in April 2015 it would pay for the company. Mylan rebuffed the offer. Glass Lewis, another proxy advisory group, also advised against voting for the chairman's pay, calling it excessive, and against three of the directors on the compensation committee. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, speaking for the city pension fund, said,  With ISS backing our recommendations and Glass Lewis largely validating our concerns, the stage is set for shareowners to deliver real change at Mylan.  The investigations followed years of price increases for Mylan's life-saving allergy treatment EpiPen and began after it hit more than $600 a year ago. The government said last fall Mylan had misclassified the drug and was overcharging the Medicaid program. ISS described Coury's pay package as  outsized  including a $43.6 million equity award for service as non-executive chairman through 2021. His 2016 compensation package is worth at least $97 million, regulatory filings show. ISS threw its weight against 10 Mylan director nominees including Chief Executive Heather Bresch, President Rajiv Malik, and Coury, as well as the compensation committee members.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mylan-board-idUSL1N1J910X"},

Although the possibility of the ruling Conservatives seeking to keep some British access to the European Union's single market has increased, so too has the likelihood of a chaotic departure from the bloc, executives said, meaning they have to plan for the worst.  When the facts change, I'll change my mind,  said Keith Skeoch, chief executive of Scottish insurer and asset manager Standard Life, borrowing a quote from economist John Maynard Keynes.  Until then, I think you continue to plan for a hard Brexit, until you can see evidence of that beginning to shift and change,  he told Reuters. Large global banks in London plan to move about 9,000 jobs in the next two years to financial centres that will stay in the EU, including Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin, so they can continue selling their services across the bloc after Brexit, according to a Reuters' tally of job warnings. The Conservatives' major setback in the general election last week has deepened uncertainty over Prime Minister Theresa May's plans for Brexit, including a departure from the European customs union as well as the single market, and a focus on controlling immigration. May's authority has been weakened after her gamble in calling an early election backfired, leaving her increasingly dependent on fellow Conservatives who object to her plan for a clean break from the EU. Some of May's cabinet colleagues and other senior party members are urging her to change direction. Conservatives in Scotland, which voted heavily to remain in the EU last year, are pushing for May to move the focus of Brexit talks due to start next week onto achieving economic growth and away from immigration, sources in the Scottish party told Reuters. Scottish Conservatives sharply increased their representation in the Westminster parliament last week, in contrast to the party's losses in England, strengthening the influence of their leader Ruth Davidson within the party. Foolish to Hold Off Brexit Minister David Davis said on Monday that the minority government still plans to take Britain out of the single market, noting that most Britons voted for either the Conservative or Labour parties which both said they back such an exit. Miles Celic, the chief executive of TheCityUK, Britain's most powerful financial lobby group, said the comments indicated the government plans to continue with its current strategy and that it retains a parliamentary majority to leave the EU.  What we have not seen over recent days is any concrete or firm shift in the expectations that we've got regarding timescale,  he said. An executive at one international bank warned that because the negotiating clock is now ticking there is now a higher likelihood that the government will fail to get a deal altogether by the March 2019 deadline.  You could argue that with the government in minority now, its leadership credibility shot to pieces, there's almost a higher probability of no deal,  the executive said.  We would be foolish to hold off on our plans.  A government relations official at another bank said the financial industry will still make a renewed attempt to lobby the government to secure more access to the single market, a staggered exit from the EU and more relaxed immigration controls. The official expected the blow to May's authority to increase the power of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, benefiting business. British newspapers had previously reported a rift between May and Hammond and that she had planned to sack him after the election if she had won a larger majority.  Hammond is a pragmatist, he is business-friendly and the Treasury have done all the serious work on Brexit,  the official said.  The door will be a lot more open now than it used to be, and that can only be a good thing.  Rishi Khosla, the chief executive of OakNorth Bank, said the uncertainty around the minority government will hurt the economy for the next couple of years, but in the end it will be a better result for Britain.  In the short term, individuals and businesses are likely to suffer because of the instability of the government,  he said. However, he added:  It is a great opportunity to reposition after what proved to be an unpopular campaign strategy to come up with something more pragmatic, business-friendly and Europe-friendly.

The U.S. said it would not sign up to a pledge by Italy, Canada, Japan, France, Britain and Germany which called the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change  irreversible  and key for the  security and prosperity of our planet . As a consequence, Washington formally refused to back multilateral development banks -- bodies designed to finance poorer nations and help them reduce their pollution emissions. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris deal earlier this month and the U.S. position was laid out in a brief note at the bottom of a general communique following a meeting of G7 environment ministers in this northern Italian city.  The U.S. is now left as a footnote to climate action and that's very sad,  said Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna.  Everyone expressed their deep disappointment with the U.S. decision,  she said. The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, only attended the first day of the meeting on Sunday, held as an early summer heatwave settled over Italy, before flying back to Washington.  In a statement on Monday, he defended the U.S. position.  We are resetting the dialogue to say Paris is not the only way forward to making progress,  he wrote.

Trump, who has in the past dismissed climate change as a hoax, says the Paris accord would undermine the U.S. economy, cost jobs, and put his country at a disadvantage to its competitors. Slideshow (2 Images)McKenna said the Paris agreement could create economic opportunities worth  in the tens of trillions of dollars . The 2015 accord, backed by nearly 200 countries, aims to limit global warming to 2 degrees or less by 2100, mainly through pledges to cut carbon dioxide and emissions. When announcing the U.S. was pulling out of the Paris accord Trump said his administration would begin negotiations either to re-enter the deal or set up a new agreement on  terms that are fair to the United States . Under the pact, the United States - the world's second biggest carbon emitter behind China - had committed to reduce its emissions by 26-28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Italian Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti said a dialogue had been kept open with the U.S. to see if there were the conditions for Washington to reenter the Paris accord.  But one thing is clear, the accord is irreversible non- negotiable and the only instrument for fighting climate change,  he told reporters.

Statoil said the Stavanger court had lifted an injunction on the use of its Cap-X technology in the Blaaman well, where drilling was suspended earlier, but had upheld a ban on the four other Arctic wells planned to be drilled this year. When presenting Cap-X last year, Statoil said it would help reduce drilling costs. Small Norwegian firm NeoDrill said Cap-X included essential parts of NeoDrill's CAN technology, developed since 2001, and to which Statoil had access as NeoDrill's minority stakeholder since 2010.  Statoil disagrees that there has been a patent infringement and this will then now be concluded in Oslo District Court,  Morten Eek, a spokesman for Statoil said by email. Statoil also said the injunction was pending NeoDrill posting 20 million Norwegian crowns ($2.4 million) security. Kyrre Tangen Andersen, a lawyer representing NeoDrill, confirmed that the court had asked NeoDrill to post the security, and said the firm was working on it. He added the court had agreed to lift the injunction on the Blaaman well because its suspension would had been too costly. Drilling exploration wells can cost tens of millions of dollars, and Arctic wells are more expensive due to the need to use rigs that can withstand harsh environments. Statoil's spokesman said the company was planning to complete the Blaaman well this summer, while it was currently drilling the Kayak well in the Johan Castberg field by using  regular equipment . Statoil plans to drill at least five wells in the Barents Sea this summer, stepping up exploration campaign in the Arctic, which is estimated to hold majority of undiscovered resources off Norway.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/statoil-drilling-lawsuit-idUSL1N1J90ZG"},

In the midst of war, Hassino set out to find Syria's  Mr Gay  to send to an international beauty pageant. Hassino, a Syrian journalist and gay rights campaigner, saw LGBT people targeted by all sides in Syria's six-year-old conflict. And women disproportionately bore the brunt of the violence.  With the war, gender-based violence reached a peak,  said Hassino, 42.  Women suffered and the LGBT community as well. Any kind of gender expression is not possible during any war.   His quest to find Mr Gay Syria is now the subject of a documentary directed by Ayse Toprak, a Turkish journalist for whom Hassino worked as a fixer. The documentary, to be screened at the Sheffield documentary festival in Britain on Tuesday, depicts the lives of gay and bisexual Syrians in Istanbul as they compete for a place in the Mr Gay World competition. Not Just Islamic State When anti-government protests started in cities across Syria in 2011, Hassino hoped one of the outcomes would be more freedom for LGBT people. The uprising sparked hopes of more rights for minorities in a country where homosexuality is illegal, and people started coming out about their sexual orientation, talking about gay rights and women's rights, Hassino said. During the first few months of the civil war that ensued, it seemed as though Hassino's hopes had come true.  It had become easier for LGBT people because people weren't targeted systematically,  Hassino told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Berlin, where he now lives. But soon, they became a target for all groups involved in the conflict. In the most notorious example, rights groups have accused Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq of killing dozens of gay men by throwing them from buildings or stoning them. Gay men in Syria can face arrests,  honor killings  at the hands of family members, or murder by Islamic State and other militant groups. Beauty Contest Hassino, who had worked in Syria with Iraqi sexual and gender minorities, decided to shed light on the abuses by sending a Syrian to the Mr Gay World beauty pageant in Malta last year.  I had the idea of trying to create a media buzz around the situation which also highlights the Syrian LGBT refugee problem,  Hassino said. Even though the competition's winner, Husein, did not make it to the event because of visa restrictions, Hassino himself traveled to Malta to raise awareness of the persecution gay Syrians face. He says the film will document their experiences for future generations.  As a journalist, I think documentaries are more important than beauty pageants,  he said. Hassino now works with LGBT refugees in Germany - many of whom were targeted and beaten up in refugee camps. His hopes for a swift change in attitudes to LGBT people have ebbed away.  Maybe after the war ends we'll talk about rights. But not now.  Reporting by Anna Pujol-Mazzini @annapmzn, Editing by Ros Russell.

Strong quarterly earnings have helped technology stocks fill a void left by financial and industrial stocks after a post-election rally faded. The S&P; 500 technology index has risen 18.5 percent this year and is on track to register its best yearly performance since 2014.  The real heavy lifting, or 40 percent of the move, that we saw was really on the back of a handful of technology stocks,  said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets.  So when you have a trade that is so crowded that unwind becomes as dramatic as the one we saw on Friday.  Investors saw an opportunity to book profits on Friday after Apple shares suffered their worst drop in 14 months amid reports that the company was using slower modems in upcoming iPhones, compared with those used in rival phones. Shares of the world's most valuable publicly-listed company were off 3 percent at $144.42 on Monday. Mizuho Securities cut its rating on Apple to  neutral  from  buy  on Monday, saying the stock had outperformed this year and that the  upcoming product cycle is fully captured at current levels . The S&P; technology sector was down 1.4 percent, putting it on track for its worst two-day decline in nearly a year, as other technology heavyweights including Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet also took a hit. The selloff in technology stocks spread through European and Asian markets as well. At 12:38 p.m. ET (1638 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 62.59 points, or 0.29 percent, at 21,209.38, the S&P; 500 was down 8.15 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,423.62 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 54.03 points, or 0.87 percent, at 6,153.89. However, gains in the energy sector and financials helped contain the decline on the broader S&P; 500 index.  Money is finding home in unloved sectors like financials and energy,  Hogan said. Shares of General Electric rose 3.8 percent to $29 after the company said Jeff Immelt would retire as chief executive and would be replaced by John Flannery, the head of GE healthcare, ending a years-long succession plan. GE was the top stock on the S&P; 500. Coherus BioSciences tumbled 29 percent to $14.65 after the FDA denied the approval of its biosimilar for Amgen's Neulasta. Amgen was up 1.5 at $166.61. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,433 to 1,388. On the Nasdaq, 1,587 issues fell and 1,227 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

He sees the game in a modern way and is eager to work with our young players.  During the interview process, Bob blew us away with his preparation, his passion, knowledge and dedication to the game. We believe that he is the right leader to get our team back to competing toward our goal of winning the Stanley Cup.  Boughner spent the last two seasons as an assistant coach with the San Jose Sharks. The Panthers have been without a coach since April 10, following the firing of interim coach Tom Rowe after a season in which the team posted a 35-36-11 mark to finish 14 points out of a playoff berth. Rowe took over when Florida ousted Gerard Gallant early in the season.

More than two million children are estimated to work in the cocoa industry across the two West African nations, where they carry heavy loads, spray pesticides and fell trees using sharp tools, according to the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI). The countries' governments, civil society groups and some of the world's top chocolate producers have in recent years ramped up efforts to tackle child labor in supply chains, invest in cocoa growing communities, and get more children into school.  Yet the economies of Ghana and Ivory Coast, which together account for more than 60 percent of the world's cocoa supply, have been hit hard by a sharp drop in world prices that have seen cocoa futures plummet by around a third since last summer.  If these low prices translate into lower incomes for poor families, and household poverty gets worse, we are worried that the risk of child labor will increase,  Nick Weatherill, executive director of ICI, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Children could be taken out of school if their families can no longer pay the costs, and many may be made to work on cocoa farms if growers cannot afford to employ laborers, he added.  The drop in prices does create greater vulnerability ... (due to) further demand in an already strained landscape,  Ruth Dearnley, chief executive officer of Stop The Traffik, said as charities and activists marked World Day Against Child Labour. Since reports of child labor on cocoa farms in Ivory Coast emerged in the late 1990s, the chocolate industry has been under pressure to prove its beans are not cultivated by children. The ICI said its child labor monitoring and remediation system (CLMRS), which it has established in the supply chains of cocoa giants Cargill and Nestle, expanded last year to cover about 60,000 cocoa farming households in Ghana and Ivory Coast. A report earlier this year by Stop the Traffik which analyzed the sustainability efforts of some of the world's leading chocolate companies found that Nestle had the best CLMRS and was the most transparent at reporting cases of child labor.   Whilst the drop in cocoa prices could potentially undermine civil society efforts to date ... the reality is that these efforts are more critical than ever,  Dearnley added.

LSE expects to increase its profit margin for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to about 55 percent by 2019, up from 46.5 percent last year, it said in a statement. Chief Executive Xavier Rolet told an Investor Day event that the  energised  and  globally competitive group  continued to see growth and investment across all of its core businesses. The bullish outlook comes despite the collapse of a merger that was expected to help it compete better with rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc, and despite heightened uncertainty surrounding Britain's intended departure from the European Union in 2019. Britain's future relations with the EU appear even less clear after Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative party lost its majority in an election. Rolet made no mention of the vote or its impact in his initial address. Analysts have said the merger collapse showed big bourse deals were off the agenda, but Rolet said asset managers, pension funds and banks want an exchange group with a global reach in a sector that is still a  construction site .  There is nobody today that has a complete suite of global businesses ... M&A; is probably going to continue. In fact, it never has stopped,  Rolet said. The exchange said it would cut costs by 50 million pounds ($63 million) annually until 2019, while operating expenses would remain stable at around a 4 percent increase. The bulk of growth will come from the group's FTSE Russell indexes unit in a sign of how exchanges are diversifying from their traditional trading platforms into what the Intercontinental Exchange calls  content . Rolet said there would also be double-digit revenue growth at its the LCH clearing unit, despite threats from the European Union to shift the clearing of euro denominated derivatives from London to the continent after Brexit. New EU securities trading rules known as MiFID II come into effect next January to introduce more  open access  competition in clearing. Rolet said most exchanges hated it, but  this group will be able to take full advantage of that regulation . The group operates the Milan stock exchange and a clearing unit in Paris. The LSE was looking at whether it should buy or build an international central securities depository (ICSD) to have a global collateral framework for customers, after the merger collapse meant Deutsche Boerse's ICSD would not be part of the group, Rolet said.

At some point you have to figure it will click for him,  manager Rick Renteria said.  You know he'll settle down and may be the second half guy we need.  OF Avisail Garcia doubled and scored in the sixth inning. Garcia has hit safely in each of his last nine games at Progressive Field, batting .343 (12-for-35) in that span with a home run, two doubles and six RBIs. OF Leury Garcia left the game in the fifth inning after jamming the middle finger of his left hand on second base during a stolen base attempt.  Hopefully it's nothing serious, but we'll know more tomorrow,  manager Rick Renteria said. LHP Carlos Rodon made his second rehab start Sunday for Triple-A Charlotte against Gwinnett. Rodon pitched 3 2/3 innings, giving up four runs on five hits, with three strikeouts and four walks. Rodon was placed on the 10-day disabled list on April 2 with left biceps bursitis. He was transferred to the 60-day DL on May 4. RHP Mike Pelfrey, who will start Monday at Baltimore, is 2-1 with a 1.69 ERA in his last four starts.

With Norfolk, he is 1-0 with a 5.87 ERA in 15 appearances. RHP Stefan Crichton's fifth stint with the Orioles ended Sunday when he was optioned back to Triple-A Norfolk. He made back-to-back relief appearances Friday and Saturday and allowed five runs and eight hits in 3 1/3 innings. Crichton has an 8.49 ERA in seven relief appearances this season. RHP Jimmy Yacabonis was added to the Orioles 40-man roster when the team purchased his contract from Triple-A Norfolk on Sunday. He became the 23rd pitcher to appear for the team this season and gave up four runs, including Aaron Judge's second homer. Yacabonis had a few family members in the stands as he is from Matawan, N.J. With Norfolk, Yacabonis was 1-0 with an 0.90 ERA in 23 outings and a .149 opponents' batting average. Yacabonis was Baltimore's 13th-round pick in 2013 after pitching in college at St. Joseph's in Pennsylvania. 3B Manny Machado missed his fourth straight game Sunday with a sore left wrist. He took swings via tee and toss while also fielding ground balls. Manager Buck Showalter said Machado would take batting practice before Monday's game in Chicago. On Saturday, Showalter said Machado was feeling better and it appeared Machado would avoid a DL stint. Machado was injured Wednesday when Pittsburgh OF Andrew McCutcheon slid into him on a play at third. LHP Zach Britton (strained left forearm strain) could begin a rehab assignment June 19 in Class A Aberdeen's season opener in the New York-Penn League, according to manager Buck Showalter. It is contingent on him getting through a 30-pitch bullpen session on Monday and a live batting practice session against hitters Thursday without difficulty. RHP Kevin Gausman endured another rough outing Sunday when he allowed seven runs and eight hits in 3 1/3 innings. While he did not set career highs for runs and hits, Gausman established a career worst for walks with six. It was the sixth straight start Gausman allowed at least eight hits and 10th time overall this season. RHP Edwin Jackson was designated for assignment Sunday after making three relief appearances for the Orioles, who signed him as a minor league free agent on April 17. Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said he hopes Jackson will clear waivers and return to Triple-A Norfolk. Showalter also added he would not be surprised if Jackson signs with another team, and depending on which team it is, it would be Jackson's 13th team since making his major league debut in Sept. 2003 with the Los Angeles Dodgers.  It's tough with him, pretty whirlwind, that's the way it is. He gets on a plane, he gets here, and he's pitching,  Showalter said.  He's better than that.

He has not pitched since May 14, 2016. SS Xander Bogaerts had a nice night with the glove Sunday against the Tigers. Bogaerts made three highlight-reel snags to record 6-3 outs over the first three innings, but committed a throwing error in the fifth.

Swinging the bat aggressively,  manager Clint Hurdle said. Diaz said offense has been a priority.  In my hitting, I try to work every day, stay inside the ball and use the whole field,  he said. LHP Felipe Rivero pitched 1 1/3 spotless innings to earn his second save. Although Rivero and Juan Nicasio are being used somewhat interchangeably as the closer, depending on the situation, it certainly appears the Rivero is the front-runner for that job since Tony Watson got demoted. CF Andrew McCutchen, stuck close to the .200 mark for much of the early part of the season, continued to raise his average. He was 2-for-4 with a triple, leaving his average at .251. He is 22-for-55 (.400) in 15 games since he moved down to sixth in the lineup.  It's baseball. You have to just keep working, keep working, keep working,  he said.  That's all I've been doing. That's what I'm going to continue to keep doing. What it takes, that's what I'm going to keep doing and, hopefully, we can keep getting some wins.  In the sixth, McCutchen acrobatically leaped high over Miami catcher J.T. Realmuto to try to avoid a tag, although Realmuto was able to reach up and tag him out.  Luckily, I didn't get hurt,  McCutchen said, laughing. It was just one of those things. The throw was going to beat me, and he was going to be there waiting. I was trying to make something out of nothing. I didn't win.  RHP Ivan Nova (6-4) was perfect through three innings, including striking out the side in the second. He allowed one hit, a single, struck out four and walked none in six innings, and has given up two earned runs or fewer in six of his 13 starts. He also has pitched at least six innings in all 13 of his starts. The last Pirates pitcher to last at least six innings in each of his first 13 starts was Eddie Solomon, who did it in all l7 starts in 1981. Nova got pulled for a pinch-hitter, but not because of his performance. Pittsburgh had just taken a 3-0 lead, chased Miami starter Jeff Locke and wanted to sustain the rally.  It was a run thing -- bases loaded, one out. Trying to blow it open,  manager Clint Hurdle said. Nova understood.

Esch was claimed on waivers from Miami on March 31 and made one appearance for the Padres, walking two without retiring a hitter on April 12. He had a 7.71 ERA in one relief appearance with El Paso and a 0.87 ERA in two starts for San Antonio. RHP Dinelson Lamet (2-2) allowed seven runs on six hits and a walk with six hits in five innings.

Lamet struggled with his command and when you can't command your fastball, it's tough to pitch in this league,  said manager Andy Green.  And he struggled out of the stretch.  RHP Phil Maton was called up from Triple-A El Paso Sunday. Maton, 24, had a 2.84 earned run average with the Chihuahuas and was tied for the Pacific Coast League lead with 13 saves. He had 31 strikeouts in 25 1/3 innings over 23 appearances with a 0.59 WHIP. Maton was the Padres' 20th-round selection in the 2015 draft out of Louisiana Tech.

Bird has been on the DL since May 2 but manager Joe Girardi said there is no timetable for his return, mostly because he needs some at-bats.

RF Aaron Judge recorded his third career multi-homer game Sunday when he hit a 495-foot homer off RHP Logan Verrett in the sixth inning and a 412-foot homer an inning later. Judge's homer was the longest in terms of distance this season. The Yankees said he was among 11 players under the age of 26 to hit at least 21 homers in a team's first 60 games. New York also said he was the youngest player in team history to go 4-for-4 or better with two homers since Mickey Mantle went 4-for-4 with two homers May 18, 1956, against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park. Mantle was 24 years, 211 days when he accomplished the feat during his triple crown season. Judge turned 25 in April.

Tanaka has a 6.55 ERA after allowing five runs and five hits in five innings in a 5-4 loss to Boston. Tanaka was originally slated to pitch Sunday but was pushed back an extra day on Friday. Tanaka has stated he believes mechanics are causing his struggles, and manager Joe Girardi didn't disagree.  I really believe it's consistency in his mechanics,  he said.   It can be minor, just a tick late with your arm or your hip opens up early, your shoulder opens up a tick early and that's what leads to the inconsistency with the pitches. We've seen good sliders.

Coincidentally, the three were sharing a now-empty apartment at Triple-A Colorado Springs, where Brinson was hitting .312. In his debut, Brinson was hitless in two at-bats with two walks, and he was robbed of a base hit by Arizona shortstop Nick Ahmed in the first.  He had good at-bats,  manager Craig Counsell said.  He was facing a good starting pitcher (Arizona's Robbie Ray), but he had good at-bats.

More than two million children are estimated to work in the cocoa industry across the two West African nations, where they carry heavy loads, spray pesticides and fell trees using sharp tools, according to the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI). The countries' governments, civil society groups and some of the world's top chocolate producers have in recent years ramped up efforts to tackle child labor in supply chains, invest in cocoa growing communities, and get more children into school.  Yet the economies of Ghana and Ivory Coast, which together account for more than 60 percent of the world's cocoa supply, have been hit hard by a sharp drop in world prices that have seen cocoa futures plummet by around a third since last summer.  If these low prices translate into lower incomes for poor families, and household poverty gets worse, we are worried that the risk of child labor will increase,  Nick Weatherill, executive director of ICI, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Children could be taken out of school if their families can no longer pay the costs, and many may be made to work on cocoa farms if growers cannot afford to employ laborers, he added.  The drop in prices does create greater vulnerability ... (due to) further demand in an already strained landscape,  Ruth Dearnley, chief executive officer of Stop The Traffik, said as charities and activists marked World Day Against Child Labour. Since reports of child labor on cocoa farms in Ivory Coast emerged in the late 1990s, the chocolate industry has been under pressure to prove its beans are not cultivated by children. The ICI said its child labor monitoring and remediation system (CLMRS), which it has established in the supply chains of cocoa giants Cargill and Nestle, expanded last year to cover about 60,000 cocoa farming households in Ghana and Ivory Coast. A report earlier this year by Stop the Traffik which analyzed the sustainability efforts of some of the world's leading chocolate companies found that Nestle had the best CLMRS and was the most transparent at reporting cases of child labor.   Whilst the drop in cocoa prices could potentially undermine civil society efforts to date ... the reality is that these efforts are more critical than ever,  Dearnley added.

The justices, in a 9-0 ruling, overturned a lower court's decision that had prevented Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NOVN.S) from selling its copycat version of California-based Amgen Inc's (AMGN.O) Neupogen until six months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it. The decision has major implications for the pharmaceutical industry because it will dictate how long brand-name makers of biologic drugs can keep near-copies, called biosimilars, off the market. Even the six months at issue in the case can mean hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.  Health insurers expect biosimilars to be cheaper than original brands, like generics, saving consumers billions of dollars each year. Novartis said in a statement that the ruling  will help expedite patient access to life-enhancing treatments.   Amgen spokeswoman Kelley Davenport said the company was disappointed but  will continue to seek to enforce our intellectual property against those parties that infringe upon our rights.   The dispute involved a section of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, that created an expedited path for regulatory approval of biosimilars while trying to respect the patent rights of brand-name manufacturers.  Novartis complained that the 2015 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington handed Amgen an extra six months of exclusivity on top of the 12 years already provided under the law. Rising drug prices are a matter of concern for patients and policymakers. President Donald Trump has criticized the pharmaceutical industry over pricing practices, promising to encourage competition and bring down drug costs. Living Cells Unlike traditional drugs, biologics are made from living cells and cannot be copied exactly to make generic versions. They are used to treat a range of conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, breast cancer and diabetes.  Novartis unit Sandoz in September 2015 began selling Zarxio, the first biosimilar drug to win U.S. regulatory approval. Amgen's Neupogen and Zarxio boost white blood cell counts in cancer patients to help fight infections. After launch, Zarxio cost 15 percent less than Neupogen at list prices, according to Novartis. Sales of Neupogen, meanwhile, dropped from more than $1 billion in 2015 to $765 million last year, primarily due to competition in the United States, the company said in regulatory filings.  Biologics account for an ever-increasing share of U.S. prescription drug costs, according to an insurer trade group. It cited as an example AbbVie Inc's Humira, which costs more than $50,000 per year. Amgen sued Sandoz in 2014 in San Francisco federal court alleging patent infringement and violations of the Affordable Care Act provision governing biosimilars.  The companies disagreed on how to apply that law's requirement that a biosimilar drug maker give the brand-name manufacturer 180 days notice before launching its copycat version.  In July 2015, the appeals court ruled that the 180-day notice must be given after FDA approval, a ruling the Supreme Court reversed on Monday.

The justices, in a 9-0 ruling, overturned a lower court's decision that had prevented Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NOVN.S) from selling its copycat version of California-based Amgen Inc's (AMGN.O) Neupogen until six months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it. The decision has major implications for the pharmaceutical industry because it will dictate how long brand-name makers of biologic drugs can keep near-copies, called biosimilars, off the market. Even the six months at issue in the case can mean hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.  Health insurers expect biosimilars to be cheaper than original brands, like generics, saving consumers billions of dollars each year. Novartis said in a statement that the ruling  will help expedite patient access to life-enhancing treatments.   Amgen spokeswoman Kelley Davenport said the company was disappointed but  will continue to seek to enforce our intellectual property against those parties that infringe upon our rights.   The dispute involved a section of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, that created an expedited path for regulatory approval of biosimilars while trying to respect the patent rights of brand-name manufacturers.  Novartis complained that the 2015 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington handed Amgen an extra six months of exclusivity on top of the 12 years already provided under the law. Rising drug prices are a matter of concern for patients and policymakers. President Donald Trump has criticized the pharmaceutical industry over pricing practices, promising to encourage competition and bring down drug costs. Living Cells Unlike traditional drugs, biologics are made from living cells and cannot be copied exactly to make generic versions. They are used to treat a range of conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, breast cancer and diabetes.  Novartis unit Sandoz in September 2015 began selling Zarxio, the first biosimilar drug to win U.S. regulatory approval. Amgen's Neupogen and Zarxio boost white blood cell counts in cancer patients to help fight infections. After launch, Zarxio cost 15 percent less than Neupogen at list prices, according to Novartis. Sales of Neupogen, meanwhile, dropped from more than $1 billion in 2015 to $765 million last year, primarily due to competition in the United States, the company said in regulatory filings.  Biologics account for an ever-increasing share of U.S. prescription drug costs, according to an insurer trade group. It cited as an example AbbVie Inc's Humira, which costs more than $50,000 per year. Amgen sued Sandoz in 2014 in San Francisco federal court alleging patent infringement and violations of the Affordable Care Act provision governing biosimilars.  The companies disagreed on how to apply that law's requirement that a biosimilar drug maker give the brand-name manufacturer 180 days notice before launching its copycat version.  In July 2015, the appeals court ruled that the 180-day notice must be given after FDA approval, a ruling the Supreme Court reversed on Monday.  Writing for the court, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the decision was not based on policy arguments, but rather, the  plain language  of the biosimilar law itself.  The Trump administration had backed Novartis' arguments in the case.  Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-biologics-idUSL1N1J90KE"},

He gave no indication of timing. Hulot told reporters at the G7 environment summit in the Italian city of Bologna that it was too early to give numbers about France's aim to reduce the share of nuclear in its power generation to 50 percent from the current 75 percent.   We are going to close some nuclear reactors and it won't be just a symbolic move,  he said. EDF shares, which were down 0.8 percent before Hulot's comments, immediately fell further to stand 2.2 percent lower.  FILE PHOTO: A view of France's oldest Electricite de France (EDF) nuclear power station is seen in Fessenheim near Colmar, Eastern France, April 10, 2011.Vincent Kessler/File PhotoAsked about the possibility of introducing a carbon tax, Hulot said  France already has a carbon tax which we increase every year. At an EU level we want to increase the threshold,  he said.  Hulot's predecessor as environment minister, Segolene Royal, said in May last year that France would unilaterally introduce a carbon price floor of about 30 euros ($33) a ton with a view to kick-start broader European action to cut emissions and drive forward the December 2015 United Nations-led international climate accord. However, the socialist government quietly dropped that plan toward the end of last year as unions protested that it would lead to coal plant closures.  EDF Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy has repeatedly called for a minimum carbon price of between 30 euros and 40 euros per ton in France and Europe, which would boost the company's carbon-free nuclear power stations. Carbon prices under the European Emissions Trading System, which charges companies for each ton of carbon dioxide they emit, have fallen to about 5 euros a ton from about 30 euros in 2008 because of a glut of permits.

CBS said on Monday that 6.1 million people watched Sunday's three-hour awards show, broadcast from New York's Radio City Music Hall, where a revival of musical  Hello Dolly!  and new teenage angst musical  Dear Evan Hansen  were the big winners. This year's TV audience marked a more than 30 percent drop from 2016's television audience of 8.7 million viewers - a 15-year high for the annual awards show celebrating the best of American theater.  The audience in advertisers' coveted 18- to 49-year-old demographic tumbled even more steeply, by about 44 percent, the data showed.  Hamilton,  a musical that tells the history of America's founding fathers through hip-hop lyrics and casts African-American and Latino actors in the roles of figures like George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, won 11 Tony Awards in 2016.

The decision by Israel's security cabinet is expected to shorten by 45 minutes the daily average of four hours of power that Gaza's 2 million residents receive from an electricity grid dependent on Israeli supplies, the officials said. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) blamed Hamas's failure to reimburse it for electricity for the reduction in power supplies. But PA spokesman Tareq Rashmawi coupled that explanation with a demand that Hamas agree to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's unity initiatives, which include holding the first parliamentary and presidential elections in more than a decade.  We renew the call to the Hamas movement and the de facto government there to hand over to us all responsibilities of government institutions in Gaza so that the government can provide its best services to our people in Gaza,  he said. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said Israel and the Palestinian Authority  will bear responsibility for the grave deterioration  in Gaza's health and environmental situation. A Palestinian woman lights a candle inside her house during power cut in the southern Gaza Strip.Ibraheem Abu MustafaAny worsening to Gaza's power crisis - its main electrical plant is off-line in a Hamas-PA dispute over taxation - could cause the collapse of health services already reliant on stand-alone generators, many of them in a poor state of repair, Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza, said.  Israel charges the PA 40 million shekels ($11 million) a month for electricity, deducting that from the transfers of Palestinian tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Authority. Israel does not engage with Hamas, which it considers a terrorist group. Slideshow (5 Images)Last month, the Palestinian Authority informed Israel that it would cover only 70 percent of the monthly cost of electricity that the Israel Electric Corporation supplies to the Gaza Strip. At the security cabinet session late on Sunday, ministers decided that Israel would not make up the shortfall, the officials said.  This is a decision by (Abbas) ... Israelis paying Gaza's electricity bill is an impossible situation,  Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said on Army Radio. Israeli military and security chiefs backed the move, despite concern Hamas could respond by increasing hostilities with Israel. Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip from Abbas's Fatah movement in 2007, and several attempts at reconciliation, most recently in 2014, have failed. Hamas has accused Abbas of trying to turn the screw on them to make political concessions.

Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB-' with a Stable Outlook and Short-Term IDR at 'B'. At the same time Fitch is transferring the IDRs to Telenet Group Holdings N.V, which is now the parent company of Telenet with the same Long- and Short-Term IDRs of 'BB-'/'B'. The Outlook is Stable. The transfer follows a reorganisation of the company structure following its acquisition of mobile operator BASE. Following the acquisition, Telenet Group Holdings N.V. has become the ultimate parent of the group. The agency has also affirmed the group's senior secured rating at 'BB' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR2'. A full list of ratings is provided below. The ratings of Telenet reflect its strong operating profile, ability to sustain its competitive position and generate robust and stable free cash flows (FCF). While competition brought about from cable wholesale regulation is likely to affect Telenet's growth profile the impact is likely to be limited and manageable. The company retains significant discretion in managing its capital structure within its 3.5x-4.5x net debt-to-EBITDA target as a result of strong cash generation and a flexible shareholder remuneration approach. The flexibility of this approach is key to Telenet's credit profile and ratings. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Operating Position: Telenet operates a cable network within Flanders and some parts of Brussels. Consolidation of local loop unbundling providers has resulted in duopolistic competition in infrastructure-based fixed line within the consumer segment. Fibre-to-the-home deployment from incumbent Proximus has so far been slower than in other western European markets such as France, Spain and the Netherlands. Within its franchise area, Telenet services around 65%-70% of households, to which it provides TV, broadband or fixed-line telephony. This provides sufficient scale to generate a stable underlying pre-dividend FCF of around EUR400 million per year. Sustaining Competitiveness a Virtuous Circle: Telenet has been able to sustain its leading market position by investing in its network infrastructure, providing rich, value-for-money content bundles and improving customer service. This supports the company's FCF generation, which in turn enables investments in network infrastructure and content that improve the value of Telenet's product proposition and aid product differentiation. Mobile Network Strengthens Operating Profile: The acquisition of mobile operator BASE in 2016 enabled Telenet to gain mobile network ownership, expand distribution across the country and more than double its mobile subscriber base. Mobile network ownership enables Telenet to fully exploit the economic benefits of sector convergence while removing limitations on volume-based data pricing and B2B/SME segment servicing that the alternative MVNO model would impose. Wholesale Regulation May Change: New Belgian regulation in 1Q16 allows third parties access to Telenet's cable infrastructure on a wholesale basis, based on a retail minus pricing formula that applies to TV and broadband combined. The Belgian regulator is considering changing the formula to a 'cost plus' approach, which creates some uncertainty. The move, if it happens, is unlikely to occur in the short-term but would reduce the wholesale fees that Telenet receives while improving the economics for the retailing party Orange Belgium. Competition from Wholesale Regulation Manageable: We believe the impact on Telenet from wholesale regulation is likely to be limited and manageable. Our base case scenario continues to envisage a EUR60 million- EUR70 million impact on EBITDA if Orange Belgium takes a 10% market share in Flanders and Brussels. This is based on the existing retail minus formula and assumes the new entrant takes 80% from Telenet and 20% from Proximus while losing an average value customer. Telenet has sufficient margin in its pre-dividend FCF to absorb the impact and maintain funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage (leverage) below 5.2x if it chooses. A move to a cost plus pricing formula could increase the impact on EBITDA assumed in our base case, the extent of which would depend on how Orange Belgium passes on margin savings to customers. However, our assumptions on the impact to Telenet is arguably cautious; the greatest loss of market share is likely to occur in price-sensitive segments, Orange Belgium already has a low margin on the product and a 10% market share shift is unlikely in the short-, or even medium, term. Factors that constrain market share loss include market maturity and churn levels, the prevalence of triple-play take-up and the cost of economically providing attractive content. Commensurate Shareholder Remuneration: Telenet retains significant discretion in managing its capital structure due to its strong FCF generation. The company ties shareholder remuneration to growth, market opportunities and operating risks. The approach is credit-positive as it provides flexibility for M&A;, investments and the preservation of credit metrics. Leverage Profile: Historically Telenet has broadly managed leverage towards the middle of their target net debt-to- EBITDA 3.5x-4.5x. The midpoint corresponds to the upper end of the FFO adjusted net leverage threshold for its current ratings, which is 5.2x. Fitch's base case forecasts assume that leverage will be maintained at this upper level through shareholder dividends of EUR400 million-EUR500 million per year. Notching of Secured Debt: In line with Fitch's notching criteria, the company's secured debt is rated 'BB', one notch higher than the IDR. The Recovery Rating on Telenet's senior secured debt is capped at 'RR2' due to the Belgian Country Ceiling. DERIVATION SUMMARY Telenet's ratings are driven by the company's strong operating profile, which is supported by a comparatively favourable market structure in broadband and a sustainable competitive position. This enables Telenet to generate robust and stable FCF and support a leveraged balance sheet. The company's leverage target relative to other western European telecoms operators is high and represents a constraint on the ratings. Telenet targets leverage 3.5x - 4.5x net debt- to-EBITDA (based on its definition). This is broadly in line with similarly rated cable peers Virgin Media Inc. (BB-/Stable) and VodafoneZiggo Group BV (BB-/Negative) once net debt is adjusted for finance leases. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Stable yoy revenue growth in 2017; - Mid-single-digit yoy EBITDA growth in 2017; - A capex/sales ratio of around 24%; - Dividend payments of EUR300 million in 2017 and growing to EUR500 million from 2018; - In line with Fitch's policy to only include M&A; activity once it is completed, the acquisition of SFR Belux has not been included in Fitch base case scenario of the group. The acquisition will, however, have limited impact on Telenet's credit metrics. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - A weakening in the operating environment due to increased competition from cable wholesale leading to a larger than-expected market share loss and decrease in EBITDA. -FFO-adjusted net leverage consistently over 5.2x (corresponding to approximately 3.8x-to-4.1x net debt-to- EBITDA based on the company's definition and growth in cash tax payments) and FFO fixed charge cover trending below 2.5x (2016: 3.4x). -A change in financial or dividend policy leading to new, higher leverage targets. Positive rating action is unlikely in the medium-term unless management pursues a more conservative financial policy. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: Telenet has a strong liquidity position as a result of positive internal cash flow generation and undrawn credit facilities of EUR545 million as of end-2016.

The three-year note auction was first of three coupon debt auctions this week. The Treasury will sell $20 billion in 10-year notes at 1 p.m. (1700 GMT) and $12 billion in 30-year bonds on Tuesday. The ratio of bids to the amount of three-year notes offered was 3.00, the highest since December 2015 when it was 3.14. This measure of overall auction demand was 2.76 at the previous three-year note auction in May. The yield of the latest three-year Treasury issue was 1.500 percent, the lowest in four monthly auctions. The robust bidding stemmed from heavy demand from indirect bidders which include domestic fund managers and foreign central banks, analysts said. The Treasury Department awarded this group of bidders 65.62 percent of the three-year supply, which was their biggest share since November 2009.  The strength of the indirect bid typically reflects the strength of investment fund demand, but given the size of the bid this month we expect it was a combination of investment fund and foreign demand,  Stone & McCarthy Research Associates' market strategist John Canavan wrote in a comment on the three-year auction.

Brazil's top electoral court dismissed a case that could have removed Temer from office, but the president is still threatened by a separate corruption investigation. Temer and his economic team, despite the uncertainty, are confident the government's coalition will approve a pension overhaul to avoid a fiscal crisis in Brazil, which is struggling to rebound from a two-year recession. Temer, who became president a year ago when his leftist 2014 running mate Dilma Rousseff was impeached, has refused to resign but has said he would not run for re-election next year. Members of the coalition government fear that failure to set the economy on the road to recovery will damage their election campaigns and the chance that a member of their own party could take the presidency.  The government has yet to see how the alliance reacts in the next few weeks,  the economic team official said.  But it is not rational not to approve the reforms now ... if congressmen dilute the reform they will shoot themselves in the foot.  Temer's team will not budge on the proposal that sets a minimum retirement age and cuts pension benefits, a deeply unpopular measure, the official and a Temer aide said. Both spoke on condition of anonymity. The government is also sticking to plans to streamline tax rules in the second half of the year, the official said. He added that the relative stability of Brazilian assets mirrors market confidence that Latin America's biggest economy will pass the pension proposal that was put on ice after Temer was placed under investigation for corruption by the Supreme Court last month. After nearly splitting with Temer, his main allies are poised to stay put after his acquittal and have vowed to endorse the reforms. Last week, Temer's proposal to modernize labor rules was approved by a Senate committee.  We cannot undermine a government plan that is crucial for the economic recovery,  said Jose Anibal, a leader with Temer's main ally, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB). Some PSDB lawmakers and other members of the coalition, however, have told Reuters the government will need to water down the pension proposal, as it needs approval by three-fifths of congress to pass. The president's economic team led by Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles, a former central bank chief widely praised by markets, plans to remain even if Temer is forced out.  We believe the president will stay in office until the end of his term. But if something happens we are all committed with the reforms,  the official said. To show that commitment the economic team will push for a few changes to the tax system that they believe would make the economy more efficient without giving up revenues. Tax measures under consideration include changes to value-added federal and state duties such as PIS/COFINS and ICMS. Taxation of financial products such as asset-backed securities LCA and LCI are also being discussed, the official said.

In fact, he has nursed it back to improving sales and profits by focusing primarily on organic growth opportunities, and the business remains core to GE. Flannery will take over General Electric Co GE.N from Jeff Immelt, who is stepping aside after 16 years as head of the conglomerate he helped steer through the financial crisis but which is now worth a third less than when he took over. (Full Story) On Flannery's watch, the healthcare unit - best-known for imaging and diagnostics - has also expanded into life sciences, offering a range of services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies. GE faces tough competition for its medical imaging machines, which include MRI scanners and ultrasound devices, from rivals including Philips PHG.AS and Siemens SIEGn.DE, as well as younger Asian upstarts. But a focus on expansion into new markets has helped lift sales at GE Healthcare to $18.3 billion last year, with organic revenue increasing by 5 percent and margins by 100 basis points. Flannery has worked hard to move GE into newer areas of healthcare like life sciences, where GE has emerged as a significant player in helping with the production of biological drugs and cell therapies. Such drugs, given by injection or infusion, are a pivotal driver of innovation in the drugs industry, being used to treat complex diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer. Flannery told Reuters last year he aimed to  double down on life sciences , given this business's large and high-margin opportunities. (Full Story) One of the more innovative ideas launched by GE recently is the design of prefabricated drug factories for making complex biotech medicines, an idea it is pioneering in both China and Ireland. GE reckons its  off-the-shelf  modular factories are 25 to 50 percent cheaper than the traditional plants and can be constructed in just 18 months rather than the typical three years. (Full Story) Some analysts continue to question whether healthcare truly fits with mainstay GE industries like power generation and jet engines, but Flannery's elevation suggests the group is not contemplating ditching healthcare any time soon. In a sign of continuity, GE said Kieran Murphy, who currently heads life sciences, would lead the wider GE Healthcare division - and the company stated bluntly:  Healthcare is a key GE business now and in the future.

The fund is a sub-fund of the Irish-domiciled umbrella fund, State Street Global Advisors Liquidity PLC. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AAAmmf' rating reflects: -The fund's overall credit quality and diversification; -Low exposures to interest rate and spread risks; -Holdings of daily and weekly liquid assets consistent with shareholder profiles and concentrations; -Maturity profile consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating criteria. Portfolio Credit Quality/Diversification The fund is newly launched, and commences operations on 12 June 2017. Fitch has relied on an expected portfolio composition to conduct its analysis. The fund will seek to maintain a high credit quality, consistent with Fitch's money market fund rating criteria at the 'AAAmmf' level, by investing in a range of fixed- and floating-rate instruments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government. These instruments may include, but are not limited to, treasury bills, treasury coupons/bullets and bonds that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury as well as repurchase agreements backed by such securities with counterparties with a minimum rating of 'F2' or equivalent. Maturity Profile The fund will seek to limit interest rate and spread risk by maintaining weighted average maturities (WAM) and weighted average lives (WAL) at or below 60 days and 120 days, respectively. All investments will have a residual maturity of up to and including 397 days. Liquidity Profile The fund will seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet investors' redemption requests. No material investor concentrations in the fund are expected. Fund Objectives The fund seeks to maintain a high level of liquidity, preserve capital and stability of principal expressed in USD and, consistent with those objectives, earn current income and aims to provide a return in line with money market rates. Investment Advisor State Street Global Advisors Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global Advisors Holdings Inc., whose ultimate parent entity is State Street Corporation (AA-/Stable/F1+). State Street Corporation is a global institution that engages in a wide range of financial services. Fitch views State Street Corporation's and State Street Global Advisors Limited's investment management capabilities and procedures as consistent with the 'AAAmmf' ratings assigned to the fund. As of 31 December 2016, State Street Global Advisors had over USD2.4 trillion assets under management. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality, market risk, and/or liquidity profile of the fund. Temporary deviations from Fitch's criteria need not automatically result in a rating change, provided the fund manager is able to address them with credible near-term remedial actions. However, material adverse and continued deviations from Fitch's guidelines for any key rating driver may lead to any of the ratings being placed on Rating Watch Negative or downgraded. SURVEILLANCE After a limited on-boarding period, Fitch will receive fund holdings information and other pertinent fund data from State Street Fund Services (Ireland) Ltd (the administrator) to conduct surveillance against ratings guidelines and to maintain the MMF ratings.

Some 100 police officers and over 1,000 workers hired by the government razed shacks with chainsaws and sledgehammers as many residents defended their homes, shouting at the demolition crews. The injured policeman was hit in the head by a stone. Residents say they were not adequately consulted and were not compensated for the loss of their homes. City authorities and a private company that plans to use the land for new homes, hospitals, parks and a golf course, said the people had occupied the land expecting compensation, knowing it would be confiscated for development. Just 14 months into the government of Aung San Suu Kyi, the forced eviction drew comparisons to methods used by the previous, military-backed government. At that time, Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was a defender of forcibly removed squatters. Among the removed residents was Thein Htay, 49, and his 9-year-old son. They stood beside their blankets, television set, clothes and cutlery scattered on the ground next to a pile of bamboo which a few hours earlier had been their home. A detained man is seen as authorities demolish huts occupied by informal settlers on the city's suburbs, to clear the land for development, in Hlegu township outside Yangon, Myanmar June 12, 2017.Soe Zeya Tun I can't afford living in Yangon. I wanted to own a house for the first time in my life, but now everything has been destroyed,  said Thein Htay. He had bought a piece of land two months ago from a broker who advertised in a state-owned newspaper. He paid over $440 and built his house with bamboo. Slideshow (3 Images) Now I have nowhere to go and I don't have enough money to move to another place,  he said. Yu Khine, director at the Yangon government housing department that led the clearance operation, said:  We will not compensate any of them because they are squatters for their own profit. This land belongs to the government.  The NLD in the past supported people facing forcible evictions, and, after coming to power last year, promised to solve land disputes, but critics say it has made little progress. Yangon-based analyst for Human Rights Watch, Richard Weir, called on the government to uphold citizens' rights. If not, Weir said,  peoples' rights to adequate housing would be particularly effected and, if not provided adequate consultation or compensation, could leave a large number of people landless and highly vulnerable.

In fact, he has nursed it back to improving sales and profits by focusing primarily on organic growth opportunities, and the business remains core to GE. Flannery will take over General Electric Co from Jeff Immelt, who is stepping aside after 16 years as head of the conglomerate he helped steer through the financial crisis but which is now worth a third less than when he took over. On Flannery's watch, the healthcare unit - best-known for imaging and diagnostics - has also expanded into life sciences, offering a range of services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies. GE faces tough competition for its medical imaging machines, which include MRI scanners and ultrasound devices, from rivals including Philips and Siemens, as well as younger Asian upstarts. But a focus on expansion into new markets has helped lift sales at GE Healthcare to $18.3 billion last year, with organic revenue increasing by 5 percent and margins by 100 basis points. Flannery has worked hard to move GE into newer areas of healthcare like life sciences, where GE has emerged as a significant player in helping with the production of biological drugs and cell therapies. Such drugs, given by injection or infusion, are a pivotal driver of innovation in the drugs industry, being used to treat complex diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer. Flannery told Reuters last year he aimed to  double down on life sciences , given this business's large and high-margin opportunities. One of the more innovative ideas launched by GE recently is the design of prefabricated drug factories for making complex biotech medicines, an idea it is pioneering in both China and Ireland. GE reckons its  off-the-shelf  modular factories are 25 to 50 percent cheaper than the traditional plants and can be constructed in just 18 months rather than the typical three years. Some analysts continue to question whether healthcare truly fits with mainstay GE industries like power generation and jet engines, but Flannery's elevation suggests the group is not contemplating ditching healthcare any time soon. In a sign of continuity, GE said Kieran Murphy, who currently heads life sciences, would lead the wider GE Healthcare division - and the company stated bluntly:  Healthcare is a key GE business now and in the future.

The top electoral court on Friday dismissed a case that threatened to unseat Temer, giving him some breathing room but potentially lengthening a political crisis. Temer is being investigated separately by federal prosecutors for corruption, obstruction of justice and racketeering.     Brazilian markets have sold off since the scandal broke last month as questions grew over the future of Temer's planned reforms of the country's pension system and labor regulations.     The Brazilian real slipped 0.6 percent on Monday after weakening nearly 5 percent since May 18, when reports emerged that Temer was caught on tape allegedly condoning bribes to silence a key witness in a corruption case.     The benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 1 percent, weighed down by blue chips such as lenders Banco Bradesco SA  and ItaÃº Unibanco Holding SA and miner Vale SA.     Also fueling caution was the Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week, when the U.S. central bank is expected to hike rates a notch.     Still, a mixed batch of economic figures has cooled bets on further hikes, with traders looking to the Fed's policy statement for clues on the pace of future tightening.     The Mexican peso was nearly flat after touching a 10-month high last week, while the Chilean peso firmed 0.3 percent.

Three top shareholders, who together own more than 30 percent of Petropavlovsk, have put forward resolutions aimed at replacing Chairman Peter Hambro, who set up the Russian-focused miner in 1994. Citing corporate governance failures, the rebel shareholders are also seeking to replace three non-executive directors with their nominees. Shareholder advisor ISS said in a report seen by Reuters that  in the absence of detail that would lend weight to the requisitionists' claim of inadequate corporate governance controls, support for the shareholder nominees is not warranted at this time . Another advisor Glass Lewis shared its view.  In our view, the dissidents' arguments lack the substantive detail and refinement that we would expect from a campaign seeking to replace a majority of the board,  it said in a report. Both ISS and Glass Lewis advise investors on which way to vote at AGMs. Hambro has accused the rebel shareholders of pursuing  a takeover by stealth  led by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg. Petropavlovsk returned to profitability in 2016 after restructuring to tackle its debts. The resolutions put forward by the three shareholders - Veselberg's conglomerate Renova along with M&G; and Sothic - seek to replace four of six board members, including Hambro, who has said he will step down as chairman, but stay on the board as an executive director. The ISS report included a statement from Renova saying  the current board lacks the requisite focus on corporate governance and does not endorse the principle of good governance that should be followed by a public company . A separate statement in the ISS report from M&G; and Sothic referred to  multiple strategic mistakes made by Petropavlovsk over the course of 2014, 2015 and 2016, which have significantly destabilised the business and delayed its recovery . Petropavlovsk announced last month that Andrew Vickerman would become interim non-executive chairman after the June 22 AGM and has appointed recruitment specialists to find a permanent replacement for Hambro. Petropavlovsk's share price has recovered to around 8 pence from a low of around 5 pence in early 2016.

Lanfear,COHERUS,FDA/ (UPDATE 3),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Coherus BioSciences Inc said on Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)30  declined to approve its biosimilar copy of Amgen Inc's blockbuster treatment, Neulasta, which is used to fight infections in cancer patients. Shares of Coherus tumbled 30 percent to $14.47 in morning trading, while Amgen's shares were up slightly at $164.19. Drug developers including Redwood City, California-based Coherus are racing to make the first biosimilar copy of Neulasta, which generated about $4.6 billion or a fifth of Amgen's sales last year. Amgen expects biosimilar competition for the drug by the fourth quarter of 2017, it said earlier this year. The FDA last year declined to approve Novartis AG's copycat for Neulasta, while its decision on Mylan NV and Biocon Ltd's biosimilar is expected by October. Biotech drugs such as Neulasta are made inside living cells, so it is impossible to make exact generic copies, as is possible with simple pills. As a result, regulators are approving products that are  similar  enough to do the same job. Developing biosimilars requires considerable expertise and is relatively costly, but investment in the field is growing as many blockbuster biotech medicines start to go off patent. Coherus on Monday said the FDA had not asked it to conduct another trial on its Neulasta copy, but instead requested a re-analysis of some existing data with a more sensitive assay. An assay is a tool used to detect a marker of disease or risk in a sample taken from a patient. It would take Coherus up to six months to address the FDA's concerns, and the FDA could take another six months to review the company's submission, Coherus Chief Executive Dennis Lanfear said on a call with analysts. Amgen earlier this year filed a lawsuit against Coherus alleging that Coherus poached its employees and encouraged them to use Amgen's trade secrets to speed up production of biosimilars. Coherus denies the charge. Lanfear was previously Amgen's vice president of market development, while Coherus's chief scientific officer once managed Amgen's analytical R&D; department. Amgen won approval for Neulasta in 2002 as a longer-lasting version of its earlier drug, Neupogen. Both drugs are designed to boost infection-fighting white blood cells following chemotherapy. Coherus, which is developing various biosimilars, has also submitted an application to market its Neulasta copy in Europe.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/coherus-fda-idUSL1N1J90TG"},

Shares in chipmakers STMicro , Dialog and AMS all fell between 6.7 percent to 9.2 percent following heavy losses in U.S. and Asian peers. Apple's worst drop in 14 months on Wall Street on Friday sparked a bout of profit-taking across richly valued tech stocks that have soared to record highs.  It's really hard to say whether this counter-rotation can be considered the start of something structural or just a natural correction,  Alessandro Balsotti, Head of Asset Management at JCI Capital, said. Europe's tech index fell 3.6 percent, leading sectoral losers in Europe and posting its biggest one-day loss since the post Brexit sell-off in June last year. The index has soared around 40 percent over the last year to hit a 15 year high earlier this month. Meanwhile, the pan-European index STOXX 600 closed 1 percent lower, having hit its lowest level in seven weeks earlier in the session. The index was mildly supported by gains in oil prices which lifted energy stocks and by parliamentary election results in France that looked set to give President Emmanuel Macron a huge majority to push through his pro-business reforms. Italy also offered some comfort to markets after the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement (M5S) suffered a severe setback in local elections. While the big win for Macron was expected, the result in Italy came as a surprise. France's CAC index fell 1.1 percent and Italy's blue chip index fell 1 percent, after briefly inching up into positive territory earlier in the day. Among individual stock movers, Temenos fell 6.4 percent after the banking software firm terminated a share buyback programme earlier than expected. The stock has gained 50 percent and raced to record highs since the programme was announced in November 2016. An upbeat note from Citi supported shares in French carmaker Renault, which helped lift Europe's car index by 0.4 percent, the only sector to trade in positive territory along with a flat energy index. Oil & gas firms Petrofac, Saipem and Tullow Oil were the biggest individual gainers. Among other gainers on the STOXX was Italian lender UBI Banca, which rose nearly 4 percent on the first day of a 400 million euro cash call to strengthen its capital position.

Islamic State fighters are close to defeat in the twin capitals of the group's territory, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, and officials say Baghdadi is steering clear of both, hiding in thousands of square miles of desert between the two.  In the end, he will either be killed or captured, he will not be able to remain underground forever,  said Lahur Talabany, the head of counter-terrorism at the Kurdistan Regional Government, the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.  But this is a few years away still,  he told Reuters. One of Baghdadi's main concerns is to ensure those around him do not betray him for the $25 million reward offered by the United States to bring him  to justice , said Hisham al-Hashimi, who advises Middle East governments on Islamic State affairs.  With no land to rule openly, he can no longer claim the title caliph,  Hashimi said.  He is a man on the run and the number of his supporters is shrinking as they lose territory.  Iraqi forces have retaken much of Mosul, the northern Iraqi city the hardline group seized in June 2014 and from which Baghdadi declared himself  caliph  or leader of all Muslims shortly afterwards. Raqqa, his capital in Syria, is nearly surrounded by a coalition of Syrian Kurdish and Arab groups. The last public video footage of him shows him dressed in black clerical robes declaring his caliphate from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque back in 2014. Born Ibrahim al-Samarrai, Baghdadi is a 46-year-old Iraqi who broke away from al-Qaeda in 2013, two years after the capture and killing of the group's leader Osama bin Laden. He grew up in a religious family, studied Islamic Theology in Baghdad and joined the Salaafi jihadist insurgency in 2003, the year of the US-led invasion of Iraq. He was caught by the Americans who released him about a year later as they considered him then as a civilian rather than a military target. Bounty He is shy and reserved, Hashimi said, and has recently stuck to the sparsely populated Iraq-Syria border where drones and strangers are easy to spot. The U.S. Department of State's Counter-Terrorism Rewards Program had put the same $25 million bounty on Bin Laden and Iraqi former president Saddam Hussein and the reward is still available for Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Neither Saddam nor Bin Laden were voluntarily betrayed, but the bounties complicated their movements and communications.  The reward creates worry and tension, it restricts his movements and limit the number of his guards,  said Fadhel Abu Ragheef, a Baghdad-based expert on extremist groups.  He doesn't stay more than 72 hours in any one place.  Baghdadi  has become nervous and very careful in his movements , said Talabany, whose services are directly involved in countering Islamic State plots.  His circle of trust has become even smaller.  His last recorded speech was issued in early November, two weeks after the start of the Mosul battle, when he urged his followers to fight the  unbelievers  and  make their blood flow as rivers . U.S. and Iraqi officials believe he has left operational commanders behind with diehard followers to fight the battles of Mosul and Raqqa, to focus on his own survival. A man purported to be the reclusive leader of the militant Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi making what would have been his first public appearance, at a mosque in the centre of Iraq's second city, Mosul, according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5, 2014, in this still image taken from video.Social Media Website via Reuters TV/File PhotoIt is not possible to confirm his whereabouts. Baghdadi does not use phones and has a handful of approved couriers to communicate with his two main aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defence minister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, in charge of security. There was no confirmation of an April 1 Iraqi state TV report that Jumaili had been killed.   Baghdadi moves in ordinary cars, or the kind of pick-up trucks used by farmers, between hideouts on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border, with just a driver and two bodyguards, said Hashimi. The region is well known to his men as the hotbed of the Sunni insurgency against U.S. forces that invaded Iraq and later the Shi'ite-led governments that took over the country. At the height of its power two years ago, Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. It persecuted non-Sunnis and even Sunnis who did not agree with its extreme version of Islamic law, with public executions and whippings for violating strict controls on appearance, behaviour and movement. But the group has been retreating since in the face of a multitude of local, regional and international forces, driven into action by the scores of deadly attacks around the world that it has claimed or inspired. A few hundred thousand people now live in the areas under the group's control, in and around Raqqa and Deir al-Zor, in Syria's east, and in a few pockets south and west of Mosul. Hashimi said Islamic State was moving some fighters out of Raqqa before it was encircled to regroup in Deir al-Zor. Mosul, with pre-war population of 2 million, was at least four times the size of any other the group has held. Up to 200,000 people are still trapped in the Old City, Islamic State's besieged enclave in Mosul, lacking supplies and being used as human shields to obstruct the progress of Iraqi forces by a U.S-led international coalition. The Syrian Democratic Forces, made of Kurdish and Arab groups supported by the U.S.-led coalition, began to attack Raqqa last week, after a months-long campaign to cut it off. The militants are also fighting Russian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, and mainly Sunni Muslim Syrian rebels backed by Turkey. The last official report about Baghdadi was from the Iraqi military on Feb. 13. Iraqi F-16s carried out a strike on a house where he was thought to be meeting other commanders, in western Iraq, near the Syrian border, it said. Overall, Islamic State has 8,000 fighters left, of which 2,000 are foreigners from other Arab states, Europe, Russia and central Asia, said Abu Ragheef.  A small number compared to the tens of thousands arrayed against them in both countries, but a force to be reckoned with, made up of die-hards with nothing to lose, hiding in the middle of civilians and making extensive use of booby traps, mines and explosives,  he said.     The U.S. government has a joint task force to track down Baghdadi which includes special operations forces, the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies as well as spy satellites of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. It will take more than that to erase his influence, Talabany said.  He is still considered the leader of ISIL and many continue to fight for him; that hasn't changed drastically,  he said, using one of Islamic State's acronyms.  Even if killed or captured, he added,  his legacy and that of ISIL will endure unless radical extremism is tackled.

With the anointment of John Flannery to succeed Jeffrey Immelt as chief executive, the $255 billion industrial titan appears to be doubling down on a strategy that transcends its American roots. Flannery has spent much of his career engineering growth abroad. He's also no stranger to restructuring. Despite the worldwide upheaval confronting chieftains of multinational companies, Flannery has been dealt a better hand. Immelt took over a GE addicted to finance, willing to prostitute the stellar credit ratings of its world-class manufacturing and engineering capabilities for a quick buck. Over his tenure, which started ominously on Sept. 11, 2001, Immelt did wean the company off $260 billion of financial assets, but only after the crisis forced his hand. He also divested appliances, plastics and media. For all this reimagining of GE, which included moving the headquarters to Boston and a plunge into the industrial internet, Immelt has been dogged by a poorly performing stock. GE returned $143 billion in dividends to shareholders under his stewardship, but the shares also have tumbled by some 30 percent. Although Flannery most recently has been running the company's subscale healthcare division, he has pranced across GE's landscape. His corporate bio begins in evaluating risk for leveraged buyouts. Since then, it has been a global grand tour, running businesses across Asia and in India and Argentina. This is evidence of how GE's growth resides in places where thirst for power, transportation, energy and healthcare â all of which GE's products aim to sate â will be in greater demand, even as Immelt professed last year that protectionist tendencies worldwide means  companies must navigate the world on their own.  The Allman Brothers fan will have the difficult task of reassuring executives running GE's divisions, many of whom probably fancied themselves Immelt's rightful successor, that their future is peachy. Immelt's ascension to replace Jack Welch led to defections. Flannery also will need to reassure shareholders, including Nelson Peltz's Trian, whose arrival probably greased the skids for his appointment. To satisfy these and other constituents, Flannery may have to mine the more radical elements of Immelt's strategy. A merger and spinoff of the oil and gas division with Baker Hughes, for example, creates a separate and listed enterprise where GE calls the shots. That blueprint could have wider application. As the company embarks on localizing geographically, it also could become more of a federation operationally.Â In that sense, Immelt's murky legacy may be dependent on Flannery.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The move comes at a critical time for Canadian technology companies, who are looking to lure top global talent who otherwise flock to Silicon Valley, a major employer of foreign workers.  In a world where people are becoming more and more inward, where there is a rise in populism, there is a lot of Islamophobia, a lot of xenophobia, there's a lot of anti-immigrant sentiment, Canada is uniquely positioned,  said Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains on the program's launch at a tech startup accelerator. Bains and the other government officials at the launch were careful not to mention U.S. President Donald Trump by name, instead focusing on selling the positives of their new scheme, which aims to help domestic companies exhibiting growth of at least 10 percent. But tech executives in attendance were less circumspect. Roy Pereira, the founder of an artificial intelligence company called Zoom.ai, said Trump's policies had led to more interest in Canada from workers currently living in the United States than he had ever seen in his 20-year career. Of the 150 total applications he received for three recent job postings, 50 came from U.S.-based applicants, he said, with most of the 10 he subsequently interviewed citing the political climate there as a factor in their decision to look north.  They were concerned about some of the musings of the current administration down in the U.S.,  he said. The Trump administration has sought to ban visitors from several Muslim-majority countries in a move that has been stymied by U.S. courts, and has also broadened the scope of who could be targeted for immigration violations. The Canadian plan, unveiled in November as part of a broader strategy to stoke economic growth, aims to shorten the work permit and visa issuing process to two weeks, compared to current drawn-out, bureaucratic process typically lasting six months to a year.  Investment follows talent,  said Ahmed Hussen, Canada's minister of immigration.  Investment will not come to Canada if the talent is not there,  he said. The government has not set a quota on the amount of foreigners who could join the plan in its first two years.

Britain's FTSE 100 closed down 0.2 percent, with investors dumping tech and other cyclical stocks, which feature heavily on the blue-chip index, and heading into defensive sectors. Software company Micro Focus and accounting platform provider Sage Group were among the biggest blue-chip fallers, taken down by a pan-European tech sector which marked its worst day since the post-Brexit sell-off a year ago. Anti-virus provider Sophos, which had been a top gainer after a ransomware virus spread across the world, fell 5.8 percent on the mid-cap index. Polar Capital Technology Trust fell 4 percent on the mid-caps, while Allianz's technology investment trust was down 2.3 percent among small caps. The declines came after a sharp tech sector sell-off on Wall street on Friday - Apple shares had their worst day in more than a year as Goldman Sachs put out a note urging caution across the sector.  Overvaluations of technology companies today resemble previous investment manias,  said Fergus Shaw, fund manager at Cerno Capital.  The fact that even successful businesses can become caught in a mania is evident in the case of Vodafone when its shares peaked at over 4 pounds in 2000, but are just 2 pounds today.   During this initial tech boom, Sage shares also hit a high at 8 pounds, yet despite the increased profits and dividends since, the share price is now 6.70 pounds.   Tech stocks aside, the decline took down a mixed bag of stocks, reflecting a downbeat day across European benchmarks, with the STOXX 600 down 0.9 percent. Brokers' greater caution on cyclicals, advocating a move towards more defensive sectors, was reflected in the FTSE's moves. Miners Antofagasta and Fresnillo were some of the biggest fallers while defensive stocks BT and Vodafone gained. A rare bright spot was the energy sector, with oil firms Royal Dutch Shell and BP up as oil prices rose, with traders betting the crude market has bottomed. Mitie hit a more than a one year high, up 13.5 percent after the contractor swung to a full-year operating loss after restating its accounts. Its cost-cutting programme and outlook were well received by investors.  Completed accounting review is providing Mitie with a base from which to build after a tumultuous 12 months,  said Stifel analysts, praising the 45 million pound cost efficiency programme Mitie launched. Liberum upped the stock from  sell  to  hold . Meanwhile, shares in Acacia Mining dropped 13 percent after Tanzanian media reported a government investigation team had accused the company of operating in the country illegally.

The euro and its bonds rallied after pro-European parties scored in French and Italian elections over the weekend and as the stocks jitters raised a fresh set of questions for the Federal Reserve ahead of its policy meeting this week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell almost 1.5 percent as Apple took another near-4-percent drubbing. Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft dropped 2-2.5 percent in hectic early trading.  This is the nature of the tech sector. Valuations do from time to time become very stretched and they come back and anyone who has paid a very high valuation might experience some short-term pain,  said Fergus Shaw, fund manager at Cerno Capital. The Apple-led worries had taken a heavy toll on Asian rivals including Samsung overnight and then hit Europe's big chipmakers STMicro and Dialog. The Nasdaq has still gained nearly 13 percent year-to-date, outperforming the wider market. But an ebbing of the reflation trade that was based on U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and spending promises, and a run of negative U.S. economic surprises, have prompted some investors to review the mix of their portfolios. Europe's tech index fell 3.5 percent to put it on track for its biggest one-day loss since Britain's Brexit vote a year ago. The index had reached a 15-year high earlier this month having soared around 40 percent over the last year.  It is pretty healthy to have some form of correction in the tech sector to distribute the flows into other sectors,  said ABN AMRO Chief Investment Officer Didier Duret. The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.9 percent, supported modestly by oil prices, which bolstered shares in energy stocks. First round French parliamentary election results which look set to give President Emmanuel Macron a huge majority to push through pro-business reforms also helped. Italy also offered some support after the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement failed to make the run-off vote in almost all the main cities up for grabs in local elections. Italian government bond yields fell to their lowest since January and Portugal's to nine-month lows , while French bonds closed the gap on Germany.  Macron doing well in the first round of the French parliamentary elections bodes well for him getting a majority,  said Lyn Graham-Taylor, fixed income strategist at Rabobank.  The fact that 5-Star did poorly in local elections in Italy also suggests a setback for populism in Europe.  The euro rose back to $1.1220 in the currency markets, where anticipation is building ahead of Wednesday's conclusion of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting at which the central bank is expected to nudge up U.S. interest rates. But economists will be watching to see whether the recent dip in economic data and uncertainty surrounding Trump's presidency has dented confidence. Britain's pound was in focus again, slipping back to $1.2655 and 88.45 pence per euro as Prime Minister Theresa May attempted to prop up her position after last week's damaging election result. A survey from one of the UK's biggest business groups showed confidence had been hit hard by the uncertainty created by the election ahead of the start of Brexit negotiations with the European Union next week. May's plans for leaving the EU had not changed, her spokesman said on Monday, although there were calls from Scotland to steer a course away from a  hard  Brexit.  It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders,  said Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors.  The consequences could -- if not addressed immediately -- be disastrous for the UK economy.  Feds Up The G10 economic surprise index, covering the world's 10 leading economies, has dipped below zero for the first time in eight months. JPMorgan said the  reduced upside risk to growth and inflation  had led it to underweight growth-sensitive stocks and assets in favour of high-income plays. Lower growth expectations are also feeding into dollar weakness. The greenback dropped back under 110 yen and the dollar index against a basket of currencies nudged down to 97.118 as Treasuries hovered at 2.218 percent before easing back up to 97.30. In commodities, crude oil prices extended gains after rising on Friday when a pipeline leak in major producer Nigeria counterbalanced supply worries weighing on the market. U.S. crude and Brent were both more than 1 percent higher, at $46.59 and $48.90 a barrel respectively. Copper was steady, while gold steadied after a three-day losing streak at $1,265 an ounce.

Brent crude futures were up by 63 cents at $48.78 a barrel by 1405 GMT, having hit a session high of $49.15. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 61 cents to $46.44, having peaked at $46.69. Traders and analysts said the gains looked technical in nature, after WTI rallied and encouraged a similar move in the Brent market. But they said the move might prove fleeting.  When you start to approach $45 a barrel in WTI, you're in an area where you do find some price support and I think there has been some evidence last week of investment flows coming back into crude oil,  Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.  You have to be careful not to be too optimistic for now,  he said.  Physical differentials are still under pressure and the time structure is still under pressure in Brent. It's a bit premature to call for much higher oil prices.  Traders said the price rises came as data showed speculative traders had increased their investment in crude futures by taking on large volumes of long positions.  Oil bulls have reset for a technical bounce,  said Stephen Schork, author of the Schork Report. While financial traders have confidence in rising prices, the physical market remains under pressure, especially due to a rise in U.S. drilling. U.S. drillers added eight oil rigs in the week to June 9 RIG-OL-USA-BHI, bringing the total count to 741, the most since April 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday. U.S. output has risen by more than 10 percent since mid-2016, undermining OPEC-led pledges to cut almost 1.8 million bpd of production until the first quarter of 2018. The oil price slid to one-month lows last week as evidence of rising output in Libya and Nigeria, two OPEC members excluded from the cuts, added to investor concerns about excess supply.  With the typically tighter second half of the year fast approaching, rumours of oil prices having found their bottom are doing the rounds,  PVM Oil Associates analyst Stephen Brennock said in a note.  Yet such claims are premature as lingering doubts that prolonged OPEC curbs will drain the oil glut along with the simultaneous uptick in U.S., Libyan and Nigerian output make for a bearish cocktail,  he wrote.

The operator of Gymboree, Janie and Jack and Crazy 8 stores joins a growing list of specialty retailers and department stores that have closed thousands of locations or filed for bankruptcy this year as consumers shift toward online shopping.  James Mesterharm, Gymboree's chief restructuring officer, said in a court filing the company was hurt by lower-cost competition from rival brick-and-mortar chains Children's Place (PLCE.O) and The Gap Inc (GPS.N), which have less debt financing.  Gymboree's lenders agreed to provide a $35 million loan to finance the company's operations and will invest $80 million into the company when it emerges from bankruptcy, according to Mesterharm.  We expect to move through this process quickly and emerge as a stronger organization that is better positioned in todayâs evolving retail landscape,  said Daniel Griesemer, the chief executive officer of Gymboree, in a statement. San Francisco-based Gymboree opened its first store in 1986 in California and expanded rapidly, going public in 1993. Bain Capital Private Equity took the company private for $1.8 billion in 2010. Bain launched a global expansion aimed at overtaking rivals such as Carter's (CRI.N) and GapKids, but Mesterharm said the chain failed to achieve the levels of growth it had anticipated.  The company estimated it had $755.5 million in assets and $1.37 billion in debt, according to court records. Gymboree said 35 percent of its 1,300 stores are leased from GGP Inc (GGP.N) and Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N).  The stores tend to be located in malls, where declining traffic has taken its toll on specialty retailers and large department store anchor tenants. In the past year, Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) and Macy's Inc (M.N) have closed scores of department stores, while chains such as The Limited Stores, The Wet Seal and shoe retailer Payless Holdings have filed for bankruptcy. Credit rating agency Moody's said last week it expects the ranks of distressed retailers will continue to grow over the next 18 months. It said 15 percent of the retailers tracked by the agency are now rated at the lowest end of the credit spectrum. Gymboree is represented by the Kirkland & Ellis law firm, and filed its bankruptcy in Richmond, Virginia.

The youthful activists in their signature blue jackets are struggling to gain traction, however, in areas where the opposition Peronists have painstakingly built community networks since their founder Juan Peron governed in the 1940s. Residents like Jorgelina Cardozo, who runs a free food pantry in the southern suburb of Florencio Varela, complain that Macri's welfare workers are looking for quick photo opportunities rather than long-term improvement.  They said they would keep coming but then, nothing. Nobody from the government calls any more,  she said. Macri's allies need a strong showing in mid-term elections to convince investors he can win a second term and execute an ambitious agenda of economic reform. The province of Buenos Aires surrounding the capital city of the same name is particularly important as it is home to a quarter of the national electorate, much of it either working class or without work. Macri was elected in late 2015 on promises to dismantle the heavy-handed trade and currency controls favored by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez, a free-spending Peronist who financed her government's deficit by printing pesos. Macri, scion of one of Argentina's wealthiest families, eked out a surprise win in Buenos Aires province in 2015. But he has cut popular energy and transportation subsidies to get Argentina's finances in order, earning some enemies in low-income towns. Looking to strengthen ties to the hardscrabble communities, Macri's  We're Here  program pays about $500 per month to 250 young people supporting independent organizations that provide food and social services and organize sport and cultural events. 'Doing Things Differently' Fernandez's opponents say she and her fellow Peronists bought votes with generous government spending in the poor and heavily populated circle of suburbs around the capital. Macri's government, composed of many former bankers and executives, says they are more genuinely concerned with social welfare and with fighting corruption.  The policy under the previous administration was clearly understood: you scratch my back, I scratch yours,  Pedro Robledo, the 25-year-old head of the  We're Here  program, told Reuters.  Social workers under the Macri government are doing things differently.  People like Maria Canete, who runs a food kitchen providing for 340 children up from 200 in 2015 in the suburb of Quilmes, remain skeptical.  With the previous government I did not want for anything. It's more difficult now. The food we distribute is not arriving like it used to,  said Canete, adding that she sometimes dips into her own pension to buy the food. A third of the Senate and half the lower House of Congress are up for election in October. Macri's Cambiemos, or  Let's Change , coalition is not expected to win a majority in either chamber. But if his allies beat candidates affiliated with Fernandez, who may run for a Senate seat in Buenos Aires province herself, investors will take heart in Macri's 2019 prospects.  If Macri's allies gain ground in the October election, he will start looking like a two-term president,  said political analyst Rosendo Fraga. Evita Legacy While his supporters are mostly upper and middle class, Macri says he would like his mandate to be judged on his ability to lower Argentina's poverty rate, now above 30 percent. Macri's government formed alliances with moderate Peronists and passed legislation early in his term, ending a decade-long dispute with hold-out creditors and passing a budget aimed at cutting the deficit. But the government was forced to moderate its proposal for an income tax reform last year and a capital markets reform eagerly awaited by investors has lulled. For a government bent on modernizing the economy, nostalgia for the old days can be a formidable foe. Fernandez, who succeeded her late husband Nestor, won two presidential elections thanks in part to comparisons to Peron's wife Evita who is still adored by many working class Argentines 64 years after her death because of her charity work and founding of hospitals and orphanages.  Things were better when Fernandez was president,  said Micaela Benitez, an unemployed 22-year old attending a government-sponsored event in the suburb of San Miguel.

Britainâs pound was back under pressure, down half a percent, after falling more than 2 percent following last week's snap elections that left the Conservatives short of a ruling majority and cast a cloud of political uncertainty over the country. Fed fund futures prices show investors have priced in about a 96 percent chance that the U.S. central bank raises overnight interest rates to between 1.00 and 1.25 percent on Wednesday. The nearly universal anticipation of a Fed rate hike along with a more accommodative stance from the European Central Bank after last week's policy meeting and an expectation for the Bank of England to stay on the sidelines because of political uncertainty has helped the dollar fight off a spate of recent negative data on the U.S. economy.  Ahead of the FOMC meeting things are going to be relatively quiet,  said Juan Perez, currency strategist at Tempus Inc in Washington.  The foreign exchange narrative is being dictated by the dynamics of (British Prime Minister) Theresa Mayâs negotiations in trying to form enough of a government so the Conservatives have the ability to rule.  Sterling fell 0.55 percent to $1.2650.  Our forecasts are under review but we have been one of the more bullish houses on the street and it is fairly clear that the risks are to the downside,  said Barclays' strategist Hamish Pepper. With a fourth hike in U.S. rates in 18 months now fully priced in for Wednesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's head of G10 currency strategy, Athanasios Vamvakidis, pointed to the chance of a weaker greenback after the meeting. But he also warned that results from the Bank of Japan's meeting, just over 24 hours later, might prompt some more retracement of the yen's 4-percent gain since mid-May.  The hike by the Fed is fully priced but the language will be dovish,  Vamvakidis said.  What will be interesting will be the BOJ - there have been headlines that the BOJ has been discussing an exit from emergency stimulus. They may well want to bite back against that (and) the yen has come a long way in the past few weeks.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was little changed at 97.248. The euro also was flat at $1.12.

Stocks fell, led by rand hedge shares which came under pressure on a stronger rand. At 1519 GMT, the rand traded at 12.7925 per dollar, 1.21 percent firmer than its close of 12.9475 on Friday in New York. In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 dropped 8.5 basis points to 8.405 percent. Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop said the rand and local currency debt were boosted by renewed risk appetite.  The global risk-on phase has been aided by particularly low yields in developed economies offering a good differential,  Bishop wrote in a note.  The inflows have strengthened the rand, proving the current risk-on cycle to be an opportune time to receive downgrades from a yield and currency perspective.  Moody's on Friday lowered South Africa's rating by a single notch from Baa2 to Baa3, the bottom of the investment grade table with a negative outlook, citing an abrupt cabinet reshuffle and reduced growth prospects. On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index fell 1.54 percent to 45,169 points while the All-Share index was down 1.25 percent to 51,564 points. Among the biggest losers were rand-hedged stocks, which make the bulk of their revenue outside South Africa and tend to weaken as the currency strengthens. British American Tobacco fell 1.93 percent to 883.83 rand, Richemont lowered 1.37 percent to 103.44 rand and Reinet dropped 0.84 percent to 29.34 rand.  Those kind of stocks are coming under pressure on the back of a stronger rand,  said BP Bernstein trader Vasili Tirasis. Bourse heavyweight Naspers fell 5.89 percent to 2525.00 rand after Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings , a third of which is owned by Naspers, came under pressure as Asian stocks began tracking the slump in U.S. technology stocks.

The European Union's executive European Commission is due to publish a draft law on Tuesday on how the clearing of euro-denominated financial instruments should be handled after Brexit. Clearing stands between two sides of a transaction to ensure its safe and smooth completion. LSE subsidiary LCH currently clears the bulk of euro-denominated interest rate swaps, a derivative contract that helps companies to guard against unexpected moves in interest rates or currencies. Britain, however, is due to leave the bloc in 2019, putting it out of the EU's regulatory reach. Rolet said the group could cope with whatever Brussels decides, given it has a fully authorised clearing house in Paris to ensure continuity of service to customers.  This is fundamentally an issue for customers and not for the LSE. Whatever the outcome of the euro clearing debate, we are well positioned to react and to take advantage of opportunities in this market,  Rolet told an investor day event. Forced relocation would create two pools of liquidity - a liquid  offshore  market outside the EU, and an increasingly  rump, illiquid and systematically more dangerous  market inside the bloc, Rolet said. He said that the LSE supported another option being looked at by Brussels, so-called enhanced supervision, whereby the EU has a direct say in regulating a clearing house in London. Some industry officials and analysts expect Brussels to opt for this, but with such intrusive terms that clearing houses would simply relocate to the EU anyway. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), one of the world's top derivatives industry bodies, also said on Monday that  relocation  would reduce the ability of banks to save on margin, or cash set aside in case of defaults, by offsetting positions in the same liquidity pool. That would lead to an increase of 15 to 20 percent in initial margin or cash that is set aside against an interest rate swap in case of a default, it said.  Many of the detrimental consequences ... will be felt most keenly by banks' clients,  ISDA Chief Executive Scott O'Malia said in a letter to the European commissioner in charge of financial services, Valdis Dombrovskis. Last week another industry body, the Futures Industry Association, said relocation would nearly double the amount of margin that would be needed, to $160 billion from $83 billion currently. However, Frankfurt-based Eurex Clearing said in a blog on Monday that the margin requirement would only rise by between $3 billion and $9 billion from the $83 billion base figure for interest rate swaps.

Shares of the world's most valuable publicly-listed company were off 2.5 percent at $144.93 on Monday. Mizuho Securities also cut its rating on Apple's stock to  neutral  from  buy  on Monday, citing it has outperformed this year and enthusiasm over the  upcoming product cycle is fully captured at current levels . The S&P; technology sector was down 1.4 percent as other closely watched stocks, including those of Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet, also took a hit. At 11:01 a.m. ET (1501 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 30.6 points, or 0.14 percent, at 21,241.37, the S&P; 500 was down 4.71 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,427.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 46.16 points, or 0.74 percent, at 6,161.76. Gains in the energy sector and financials helped contain the decline on the broader S&P; 500 index.  Money is finding home in unloved sectors like financials and energy,  Hogan said. Shares of General Electric rose 3.5 percent to $28.94 after the company said Jeff Immelt would retire as chief executive and would be replaced by John Flannery, the head of GE healthcare, ending a years-long succession plan. GE was the top stock on the S&P; 500. Coherus BioSciences tumbled 26.63 percent to $15.25 after the FDA denied the approval of its biosimilar for Amgen's Neulasta. Amgen was up 1.5 at $166.61. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,582 to 1,187. On the Nasdaq, 1,398 issues rose and 1,294 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

While neither Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein nor his Citi counterpart Michael Corbat revealed any sensitive information, the exchanges will raise questions about the way banks' computer systems handle emails to addresses outside their companies.  Blankfein was drawn into the simple hoax when he replied to an email purporting to be from his company's president and co-chief operating officer, Harvey Schwartz, congratulating him on a tweet that Blankfein wrote last week on a trip to China about the country's impressive infrastructure.    Tweet won some online award for humorous tweet - Trump will be so pissed ;)  the anonymous hoaxer, who used the Twitter handle @SINON_REBORN, said in a published exchange on the social media site pretending to be Schwartz.  Blankfein, who only recently joined Twitter, replied to whom he thought was Schwartz, saying he had tweeted when he landed in China because it  seemed like a good way to bookend my trip.  When asked about the incident, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York said:  In the aftermath of the elections in France and England, I would have thought Reuters had more consequential events to report on.   The prankster then attempted to draw in Corbat and Citi's head of global consumer banking, Stephen Bird, by masquerading as Citi's chairman Michael O'Neill.  Michael L. Corbat, president of the Citigroup, arrives at the Planalto Palace before a meeting with Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia April 9, 2013.Ueslei MarcelinoThe hoaxer sent Corbat and Bird an online article from British newspaper CityAM about the exchange between Blankfein and the emailer, according to the prankster's Twitter feed.   Corbat replied that he couldn't open the link.      Bird replied:  Can never be too careful Mike. Hope that's our real Chairman!  He then went on to describe Citi's email filtering system before commenting on Blankfein's mishap.   At least Lloyd was responsive ... in the new economy that's something. Some of his peers are still getting their messages printed out.   A spokeswoman for Citi in New York confirmed the existence of the email exchange but declined to comment further.  Due to concerns about hoaxing and security, a small group of the Wall Street elite refuses to say anything substantive in an email, text or chat, and some will not communicate digitally at all, Reuters reported in November. Last month, Barclays chief Jes Staley became the first high profile executive to be caught out by the prankster, and the bank reportedly responded by tightening its computer security so employees get a warning whenever they are sending messages to someone outside the firm. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney was also targeted and replied to an email he believed was from the head of the central bank's internal oversight body, Anthony Habgood. In his response, Carney poked fun at the drinking habits of one of his predecessors.

The operator of Gymboree, Janie and Jack and Crazy 8 stores joins a growing list of specialty retailers and department stores that have closed thousands of locations or filed for bankruptcy this year as consumers shift toward online shopping.  James Mesterharm, Gymboree's chief restructuring officer, said in a court filing the company was hurt by lower-cost competition from rival brick-and-mortar chains Children's Place (PLCE.O) and The Gap Inc (GPS.N), which have less debt financing.  Gymboree's lenders agreed to provide a $35 million loan to finance the company's operations and will invest $80 million into the company when it emerges from bankruptcy, according to Mesterharm.  We expect to move through this process quickly and emerge as a stronger organization that is better positioned in todayâs evolving retail landscape,  said Daniel Griesemer, the chief executive officer of Gymboree, in a statement. San Francisco-based Gymboree opened its first store in 1986 in California and expanded rapidly, going public in 1993. Bain Capital Private Equity took the company private for $1.8 billion in 2010. Bain launched a global expansion aimed at overtaking rivals such as Carter's (CRI.N) and GapKids, but Mesterharm said the chain failed to achieve the levels of growth it had anticipated.  The company estimated it had $755.5 million in assets and $1.37 billion in debt, according to court records. Gymboree said 35 percent of its 1,300 stores are leased from GGP Inc (GGP.N) and Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N).  The stores tend to be located in malls, where declining traffic has taken its toll on specialty retailers and large department store anchor tenants. In the past year, Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) and Macy's Inc (M.N) have closed scores of department stores, while chains such as The Limited Stores, The Wet Seal and shoe retailer Payless Holdings have filed for bankruptcy. Credit rating agency Moody's said last week it expects the ranks of distressed retailers will continue to grow over the next 18 months. It said 15 percent of the retailers tracked by the agency are now rated at the lowest end of the credit spectrum. Gymboree is represented by the Kirkland & Ellis law firm, and filed its bankruptcy in Richmond, Virginia.

Over the next week, five of the largest U.S. banks will light up their segments of a new payments network called Zelle, executives said in interviews. They plan to announce details of the launch on Monday, and expect another two dozen banks and credit unions to join over the next year. The long-awaited network will allow tens of millions of bank customers to send money to each other instantly - known as person-to-person payments - with a few taps on their smartphones. That is an improvement over Venmo, which immediately alerts users that a money transfer is in progress, but takes time to shift funds between bank accounts. Customers who use existing bank payment apps may not notice much of a change beyond marketing. Transfers will simply happen faster because the banks are finally linking to each other, executives said.  By coming together to offer Zelle, we are providing a large majority of Americans with a safe, fast and easy way to move money,  said Bill Wallace, head of digital at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the biggest U.S. bank by assets. JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) will be the first to plug into Zelle. The network is the product of an industry consortium called Early Warning Services LLC, whose seven owners have more than 86 million U.S. mobile banking customers. Zelle took years to establish because fierce rivals had to come together to make it work. In the interim, Silicon Valley has made inroads into digital payments, particularly with the young customers coveted by banks. In addition to Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) all offer payment platforms that allow individuals to send money to each other. The banks want to leap over those sleek but scattered offerings by connecting their critical mass of account holders through a single network. A person uses the Venmo app on a mobile phone in this undated image. REUTERS Fragmentation has been frustrating for consumers,  said Paul Finch, chief executive of Early Warning.  Inconsistent experiences have made it difficult to send and receive money between banks.  Despite losing some ground to technology companies, banks still have a big advantage: No matter what network is used to transfer money, banks hold the vast majority of funds. FILE PHOTO - A view of the exterior of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City, U.S. on May 20, 2015.Mike Segar/File Photo - RTSW2DWAnd despite the popularity of apps like Venmo, they transfer far less money than banks. The value of digital payments processed through non-financial firms was one-fifth of what banks and credit unions processed last year, research firm Aite Group estimates.  We are excited to bring the service to everybody and anybody, regardless of which brand of phone you have in your hand or which generation you belong to,  said Gareth Gaston, head of omnichannel banking at U.S. Bank. Along with building customer loyalty, banks hope that Zelle will reduce their costs from handling checks and cash. Eventually, they would like to sell access to businesses that want to eliminate their own paper-related costs. As more banks connect and more customers use the service, sending cash to another individual will simply involve knowing the person's mobile phone number or email address. Later this year, individuals with accounts at banks not connected with Zelle will be able to use its real-time features by downloading an app and pairing it with a Visa Inc (V.N) or Mastercard Inc (MA.N) debit account. In launching Zelle, banks are being careful not to confuse customers by offering yet another payments app. For instance, Chase will initially twin the brand with the QuickPay app its customers already use by showing  QuickPay with Zelle  on its mobile app and website. Eventually, the QuickPay name could fade away.

Kerry, an architect of the Paris climate agreement, said during a visit to Oslo that many U.S. companies, states and cities were pushing ahead with restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions despite Trump's pro-coal policies.  We will meet the Paris standards, I believe, in the United States,  he told a news conference.  So I want people not to be dismayed.  Trump's June 1 announcement angered many governments after almost two decades negotiating the 195-nation pact. Trump has sometimes dismissed man-made climate change as a hoax even though a U.N. panel of leading scientists says it is at least 95 percent probable that man-made emissions were the main cause of warming since the 1950s. Kerry noted that the formal withdrawal process from the Paris Agreement will last four years from the date it entered into force, on Nov. 4, 2016. Any new U.S. administration could rejoin within 30 days, Kerry said.  The Paris Agreement seeks to limit warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times to avert effects including disruptions to food and water supplies from heatwaves, floods and rising sea levels.  The majority of the people in the United States are deeply committed to the Paris Agreement,  Kerry said. Trump says the deal will cost U.S. jobs and harm the economy. President Barack Obama's voluntary U.S. target under the Paris Agreement was to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, partly by restricting coal-fired power plants. Trump's policies are likely to flatten U.S. emissions around current levels, about 11.5 percent below 2005 levels, according to a study last month by European researchers who compile a Climate Action Tracker.

The concession came after the European Commission voiced concerns about the strong market position of both Intrum Justitia and Nordic Capital-owned Lindorff, both of which have the scale to serve large customers in the banking, utilities and telecoms sectors. Under a deal first announced last year, Intrum Justitia will merge with Lindorff, leaving Nordic Capital as the combined group's biggest stakeholder with control of 45 percent of the equity through its direct and indirect investments.  To address the competition concerns identified by the Commission, Nordic Capital offered to divest the whole of the debt-collection and debt-purchasing businesses of Lindorff in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden, and the whole of the debt-collection and debt-purchasing business of Intrum Justitia in Norway,  the EU competition watchdog said. Debt purchasing typically involves the transfer of creditors' debt portfolios to buyers that in most cases collect the debts themselves. Intrum Justitia proposed the package of spin-offs in mid-May as it sought to salvage the deal for its Norwegian rival. It now has six months to carry out the divestments demanded by the EU.

Projections from the first round of Sunday's French parliamentary election suggested Macron's LREM party was set to secure a big majority to push through pro-business reforms. Meanwhile, Italy's 5-Star Movement looked likely to suffer a severe setback in local elections, a development that could undermine its hopes of winning a national vote due by May 2018 and which suggests it is losing steam like other anti-establishment parties across Europe. Those signs of stability and cohesion in two of the euro zone's biggest economies were viewed as positive not just for French assets, but also for peripheral markets that have been in the firing line from any signs of instability in the bloc. That comes on top of stronger economic growth and indications that the European Central Bank is in no rush to withdraw its massive monetary stimulus.  Confidence in the euro zone is building and political risks are fading,  said RBC's global macro strategist Peter Schaffrik.  The data is strong and the ECB is keeping monetary policy loose, so we have this Goldilocks scenario for bond markets.  Italian 10-year government bond yields fell below 2 percent for the first time since late January, down 9 basis points on the day. That pushed the gap over German peers to around 175 basis points -- its narrowest since late May and down almost 30 bps from Wednesday. Italian yields ended Friday with their biggest weekly fall of 2017 as a failure to reach an agreement on a new electoral law was seen reducing the chances of early national elections. Portugal's 10-year bond yield hit a nine-month low at 2.97 percent on Monday, while Spanish peers fell to 1.39 percent -- their lowest level since January. The euro firmed against the dollar, while euro zone shares were broadly weaker. Macron Boost French bonds outperformed higher-rated euro zone equivalents, with 10-year yields falling 5 bps to a seven-month low of just under 0.60 percent. That left the gap over Bund yields at around 35 bps versus 39 bps on Friday. Pollsters project Macron's alliance could win as many as three-quarters of the seats in the lower house after next week's second round of voting, giving Macron a powerful mandate. Rating agency S&P; Global Ratings said on Monday it was likely to raise its growth outlook for France and the euro zone now that Macron looks poised to win a huge majority. Elsewhere, Finland's bonds underperformed euro zone peers as its Prime Minister moved to break up its three-party coalition, saying he wanted to eject the nationalist Finns Party days after it chose a new anti-immigration leader.

China allows imported beans to be used by crushers to make soymeal for animal feed but none of the beans, all of which are genetically modified, are permitted for use in food products. Reports over the years have suggested however that several million tonnes of the cheaper imports could be flowing illegally into the food sector. The most-active soybean futures hit 3,996 yuan ($587.82) on Monday, their highest since March 10, as talk circulated that China's quarantine authority had asked several east coast ports to strictly inspect and punish firms found to be illegally reselling imported beans to food companies. U.S.-based grain handler CHS Inc is being probed as part of the investigation, according to a report by Bloomberg on Friday. CHS spokeswoman Annette Degnan declined to answer specific questions from Reuters about the reported probe. However, she said the company  follows strict, long-standing, established protocols for all business and sales conducted in China,  including documenting all sales. Prices ended at 3,957 yuan ($582.08) a tonne on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, up 1.5 percent on the day. The gains came after prices jumped 1.8 percent on Friday in their biggest daily gain in more than a month. Open interest, a measure of liquidity in the market, jumped by a quarter on Friday to 287,132 lots, equal to 2.9 million tonnes of beans worth about 11.4 billion yuan. Data for Monday will be released on Tuesday.  Last week this news came out that the ports were investigating this problem of leaking of imported soybeans,  said Liang Yong, an analyst with Galaxy Futures.  If the trade in imported soybeans is subject to controls, the demand side will all fall on the domestic beans.  China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing's efforts to crack down on leaking of imports into the food sector come after China imported record volumes this year and spurred hopes among some investors that the steps may help erode domestic oversupply. Still, a prolonged crackdown will upset major exporting nations including the United States and Brazil. Reporting by Dominique Patton in Beijing.

The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly valuable gauge for the Fed, showed on Monday that median three-year-ahead inflation expectations fell to 2.47 percent last month, from 2.91 percent in April. That brought the measure to a 16-month low after it had hovered near a record high the last six months. The one-year measure slid to 2.59 percent in May, from 2.79 percent in April, hitting a six month low. The New York Fed added that  inflation uncertainty  among respondents remained at a low water mark since the survey began in mid-2013.  The sharp decline, driven by younger respondents, is the latest hint that a soft patch in U.S. inflation could expand and slow the Fed's plan to raise interest rates at a pace of about three times per year. Fed policymakers are expected to hike rates a notch this week, their third tightening in six months, though price concerns have already cooled market expectations for further hikes. They have so far struck a balanced tone as the Consumer Price Index has disappointed in two straight months, and as the Fed's preferred measure slipped further below target.  In a recent speech, Fed Governor Lael Brainard painted a  mixed  picture of inflation indicators and noted the New York Fed's three-year measure was at  its highest level in more than a year  in April.  But on Monday, the New York Fed said the pull-back in May was driven by all income groups and largest among lower-income households.

Please credit Stateline, an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trusts. For downloadable graphics, please visit www.pewtrusts.org/stateline) By Rebecca Beitsch June 12 (Stateline) - Nicole Singley and her wife Jennifer had been married for more than a year when their son was born in Indiana in 2015. Jennifer had carried the boy, conceived through artificial insemination, and Nicole was there to cut the umbilical cord. But the next day, while holding their son in the hospital, they were told that only Jenniferâs name would appear on the babyâs birth certificate. Two years later, the couple is expecting another child, this time a daughter carried by Nicole, and they are still pushing the state to allow both members of married gay couples to be listed on birth certificates the day their baby is born. The course the state recommends in cases like these: adoption. In other states, the law has been on the Singleysâ side. State âpresumption of parentageâ laws, which allow hospitals to list a womanâs husband as the father of her child on a birth certificate â even if paternity hasnât been medically established â have largely been extended to married lesbian couples after the U.S. Supreme Courtâs 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized gay marriage in all 50 states. Many states did so voluntarily, while courts settled the issue in others, including Florida and South Carolina. Now, just Arkansas and Indiana are still grappling with lawsuits that contend they treat married lesbian couples differently when it comes to birth certificates. Lesbian couples involved in the suits say both names are needed on a birth certificate so that either parent can fulfill obligations like enrolling kids in school or making medical decisions for their child. But for Nicole, the worries run deeper. As a member of the Army who served a year in Iraq, sheâs worried her military benefits might not be extended to her children equally. âTheyâll be raised in the same household by the same parents,â Nicole said. âBut if something were to happen and my marital relationship to Jen would end, through my death or her death, Huck has no legal relationship with me.â Because birth certificates nearly always document the birth mother, gay male couples often have to take legal steps to terminate her parental rights before both their names can be listed on an amended birth certificate. But lesbians who deliver their own baby say their situation should fall within the existing legal framework. Indiana does not have a presumption of parentage law entitling husbands of birth mothers to be listed on the birth certificate. Instead, the form mothers fill out often asks if her husband is also the father before he is added to the birth certificate. But the plaintiffs in the case brought by the Singleys and others say a woman who decides with her husband to conceive through artificial insemination would naturally consider her spouse to be the father, and hospital staff donât question that response. The same logic should apply to same-sex couples, they say. Arkansas law requires a womanâs husband to be listed as the father on a birth certificate, unless another manâs paternity is established in court. But the stateâs Supreme Court recently struck down a lower court decision that would have extended that law to same-sex spouses, arguing the Obergefell decision does not apply to state birth certificate laws. That case is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Both states contend that accuracy is necessary in an initial birth certificate, and a brief from the state of Arkansas says listing the biological parents is in the best interest of the child, who may later have questions about their medical history. Lawyers for Arkansas said the plaintiffs should challenge the stateâs artificial insemination law, which they concede is not inclusive of gay couples. That law says the husband of a woman who conceives through artificial insemination should be considered the âlegitimate naturalâ father of the child. However, the plaintiffsâ lawyer said that law is irrelevant because it does not address birth certificates. All About Biology Without firmly established parental rights, biology could dictate much of the future for the Singleysâ children. If either Nicole or Jennifer died, their parents could seek custody of their biological grandchild without concern for the role of the remaining spouse. When Huckâs birth certificate arrived, it came with a pink slip that read âIndiana law requires that a child born out-of-wedlock be recorded under the name of the mother,â and listed the ways a father can be added to the birth certificate. In cases where one of the parents isnât biologically related to the child, Indiana recommends adoption to ensure parental rights. But the Singleys donât want to do that. âWe tried this for almost two years before we got pregnant. Weâve spent over $33,000 already just to have this child, and the state says we should spend another $7,000 to adopt our own child after weâve made all this effort?â Nicole said, citing the amount lawyers quoted the couple to complete the adoption. They find the idea that a social worker would come into their home and decide whether they get to be parents unsettling, and Nicole says no heterosexual couple that uses artificial insemination is subjected to this process. A U.S. district judge initially sided with the Singleys and other lesbian couples suing the state, ruling last year that gay couples were being treated differently than heterosexual couples and ordering the spousesâ names added to their childrenâs birth certificates. But the state challenged that decision in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing in a brief that it cannot âconfer parental rights based on emotional connections.â The state argues that, regardless of the birth motherâs sexuality, she is obligated to tell hospital staff who the father is. It also contends that while biological parents, even sperm donors, have legal parental rights, adoption is the only way the spouse of a biological parent can secure a legal connection to the child. Birth certificates donât bestow legal rights, the state argues, they merely document parental rights that exist because of a biological connection to a child. âIf a biological motherâs spouse â whether man or woman â is not the biological father of her child but nonetheless wishes to be a legal parent, the spouse should use the mechanism the Indiana General Assembly has provided: adoption,â the state argued in its brief. One of the couples suing Indiana argues that the stateâs biology argument doesnât address their situation. Before Jackie Phillips-Stackman met her wife, she froze some of her embryos after an emergency hysterectomy. Years later, they were placed inside her wife, Lisa, as the couple tried to have a child. Now, Lisa is their daughterâs birth mother, and Jackie is the biological mother. But the state only considered Lisa to be the mother, leaving Jackie to fight to be listed on the birth certificate. âBy their logic I should be listed on the birth certificate,â Jackie said. In court, the state recommended she file a maternity action, a legal move that would have meant removing her wifeâs name from the birth certificate. This is Obergefell Lesbian couples in Arkansas also won their first court battle to be listed on birth certificates, with a county court citing the Supreme Courtâs decision in Obergefell as a reason to extend the stateâs presumption of parentage laws to same-sex couples. In Obergefell, the Supreme Court wrote gay couples were being denied the âconstellation of benefitsâ associated with marriage, and said states have regularly âmade marriage the basis for an expanding list of governmental rights,â including birth certificates. But the state appealed the county court decision, and in December the Arkansas Supreme Court overturned it, arguing Obergefell does not address state birth certificate laws. The opinion pointed to a passage in the decision that says âstates are in general free to vary the benefits they confer on all married couples.â Douglas Hallward-Driemeier, one of the lawyers for the Arkansas couples, said thereâs no question Obergefell addressed state birth certificate laws. âThis is not an extension of Obergefell. These are the facts of Obergefell,â he said. â many of the plaintiffs in Obergefell, especially the ones that were already married and looking for recognition of their marriage, the basis of their claims was the state was refusing to list both parents on their birth certificate.â The Arkansas couples have appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has not yet decided whether to hear it. But Hallward-Driemeier worries that even in states where people have understood the Supreme Courtâs same-sex marriage ruling to have settled the birth certificate issue, if the Arkansas decision stands, other states may change their policy. The uncertainty was enough to push Jana Jacobs, a plaintiff in the suit, to formally adopt the two children she has with her wife Leigh. As the spouse of the birth mother, Jana said she will likely have to do the same âstep-parent adoptionâ for the third baby theyâre expecting this summer. âIâm just trying to take responsibility for my kids,â she said. âIâm not their step parent. There was never anyone else in the picture. Iâm their intended parent from birth through the rest of their life.â here","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/stateline-idUSL1N1J90NV"},

The U.S. Treasury will auction 3-, 10- and 30-year debt totaling $56 billion this week. Traders typically sell Treasuries ahead of auctions to make way for the new supply of government debt, pushing yields higher.     U.S. two-year yields touched 1.359 percent, their highest in a month, while three-year yields touched their highest since May 24 at 1.500 percent ahead of three- and 10-year note auctions on Monday. Yields on Treasuries maturing between five and 30 years also hit session highs, but remained below Friday's levels.      Investors were cautious ahead of the Fed's two-day meeting beginning on Tuesday, with analysts saying the U.S. central bank could take an aggressively hawkish posture of signaling a balance sheet reduction later this year and another interest rate increase in December.       Wednesdayâs meeting is pretty much a high-risk event,  said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasuries trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York.     Rates futures prices mirrored Wall Street's consensus that Fed policymakers would raise key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent at the end of the two-day meeting on Wednesday.     Prices suggested traders were uncertain about whether the Fed would embark on a third rate increase in 2017, however, and implied traders have not fully priced in the Fed's target range on rates reaching 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent until late 2018.      The Fed could take the hawkish stance of hinting it could taper its balance sheet in September while also hiking rates again in December, said Aaron Kohli, interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.      Treasury yields could fall, however, if the Fed takes a more dovish stance of signaling it will taper this year but not hike rates in the second half of 2017, Kohli said. A more dovish stance is seen as possible in part due to recent signs of softening inflation.     That uncertainty over Fed policy kept yields from moving even higher on Monday, Kohli said.      Benchmark 10-year Treasuries were last down 5/32 in price to yield 2.216 percent, from a yield of 2.199 percent late on Friday. U.S. 30-year yields were at 2.866 percent, up from 2.853 percent late on Friday.

Such very prematurely born babies did score lower on standardized tests than full-term infants, but as the length of pregnancy increased, the differences in test scores became negligible, according to the study, conducted by Northwestern University and published on Monday in JAMA Pediatrics medical journal.  What excites me about this study is that it changes the focus for the clinician and families at the bedside from just focusing on the medical outcomes of the child to what the future educational outcomes might be for a child born early,  Craig Garfield, the first author of the study and an associate professor of pediatrics and medial social sciences at Northwestern Medicine, said in a statement. Researchers analyzed the school performance of 1.3 million infants born in Florida from 1992 to 2002 who had a fetal development term of 23 to 41 weeks and who later entered the state's public schools between 1995 and 2012.  They found that babies born at between 23 and 24 weeks tended to have normal cognitive functions later in life, with 1.8 percent of them even achieving gifted status in school. During the time period the study covered, 9.5 percent of children statewide were considered gifted. Premature birth happens when a baby is born before at least 37 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  A normal pregnancy term is around 40 weeks, and a preterm birth can lead to serious medical problems, underdevelopment in early childhood or death for the infant.  The study does not account for why these extremely premature infants later performed well in school, Garfield said in the statement, and did not look at whether their success could be related to extra support from family or schools, or the children's biological make-up.

Concentrations of phosphorous fell by a third from 2006 to 2014 in 862 freshwater lakes around China, although they remain above clean water levels, according to the report about the chemical element in the journal Nature Geoscience. Phosphorous is vital to life, but high concentrations can trigger blooms of toxic algae that choke fish and other life. Man-made sources of phosphorous include waste water, livestock farming, aquaculture and chemicals.  The current decline in the most populated areas is due to improved sanitation facilities  such as pipelines, waste water treatment plants and improved rural toilets, said Yan Lin, an author at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research. The findings could guide other developing nations seeking ways to clean up vital freshwater resources, he told Reuters. The United Nations says that 2.4 billion people, about a third of the world population, lack access to basic sanitation services. Almost 1,000 children a day die because of diarrhoeal diseases linked to polluted water or sanitation. The study, the first to have common measurements of phosphorous across China's lakes, showed the median level fell to 51 micrograms per 1 liter (1.76 UK pints) in 2014 from 80 in 2006. That is still high, however: A level of 25 is considered good quality water in European legislation.   A long time is to be expected before Chinese lakes could reach good ecological status,  according to report by a team of scientists in China, Canada and Norway.  Phosphorous builds up in lake sediments and lingers long after sources of pollution have dried up. Despite overall declines in most parts of China, phosphorous levels had risen from low levels in the sparsely populated northeast, it said. The rise could be linked to climate change, which is causing more downpours and erosion of soils, Lin said. A study last year of rivers and lakes in the United States also found rising levels of phosphorous, perhaps linked to changing rainfall washing more phosphorous into the water.

Shares of Coherus tumbled 30 percent to $14.47 in morning trading, while Amgen's shares were up slightly at $164.19. Drug developers including Redwood City, California-based Coherus are racing to make the first biosimilar copy of Neulasta, which generated about $4.6 billion or a fifth of Amgen's sales last year. Amgen expects biosimilar competition for the drug by the fourth quarter of 2017, it said earlier this year. The FDA last year declined to approve Novartis AG's copycat for Neulasta, while its decision on Mylan NV and Biocon Ltd's biosimilar is expected by October. Biotech drugs such as Neulasta are made inside living cells, so it is impossible to make exact generic copies, as is possible with simple pills. As a result, regulators are approving products that are  similar  enough to do the same job. Developing biosimilars requires considerable expertise and is relatively costly, but investment in the field is growing as many blockbuster biotech medicines start to go off patent. Coherus on Monday said the FDA had not asked it to conduct another trial on its Neulasta copy, but instead requested a re-analysis of some existing data with a more sensitive assay. An assay is a tool used to detect a marker of disease or risk in a sample taken from a patient. It would take Coherus up to six months to address the FDA's concerns, and the FDA could take another six months to review the company's submission, Coherus Chief Executive Dennis Lanfear said on a call with analysts. Amgen earlier this year filed a lawsuit against Coherus alleging that Coherus poached its employees and encouraged them to use Amgen's trade secrets to speed up production of biosimilars. Coherus denies the charge. Lanfear was previously Amgen's vice president of market development, while Coherus's chief scientific officer once managed Amgen's analytical R&D; department. Amgen won approval for Neulasta in 2002 as a longer-lasting version of its earlier drug, Neupogen. Both drugs are designed to boost infection-fighting white blood cells following chemotherapy. Coherus, which is developing various biosimilars, has also submitted an application to market its Neulasta copy in Europe.

The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly valuable gauge for the Fed, showed on Monday that median three-year-ahead inflation expectations fell to 2.47 percent last month, from 2.91 percent in April. That brought the measure to a 16-month low after it had hovered near a record high the last six months. The one-year measure slid to 2.59 percent in May, from 2.79 percent in April, hitting a six month low. The New York Fed added that  inflation uncertainty  among respondents remained at a low water mark since the survey began in mid-2013.  The sharp decline, driven by younger respondents, is the latest hint that a soft patch in U.S. inflation could expand and slow the Fed's plan to raise interest rates at a pace of about three times per year. Fed policymakers are expected to hike rates a notch this week, their third tightening in six months, though price concerns have already cooled market expectations for further hikes. They have so far struck a balanced tone as the Consumer Price Index has disappointed in two straight months, and as the Fed's preferred measure slipped further below target.  In a recent speech, Fed Governor Lael Brainard painted a  mixed  picture of inflation indicators and noted the New York Fed's three-year measure was at  its highest level in more than a year  in April.  But on Monday, the New York Fed said the pull-back in May was driven by all income groups and largest among lower-income households. The internet-based survey is done by a third party and taps a rotating panel of about 1,200 household heads.

The 'AAA' breakeven asset percentage (AP) of the six Canadian legislative mortgage covered bonds programs on average has declined to 92.2% from 93.3% following the review based on updates to Fitch's 'Covered Bond Rating Criteria' (October 2016) and 'Canadian Residential Mortgage Rating Criteria' (February 2017). No ratings are affected since the AP relied upon for each program provides support to the updated 'AAA' breakeven APs. The lower 'AAA' breakeven APs are generally driven by a higher credit loss at the tested rating on a probability of default scenario. The higher credit loss reflects a new adjustment added to Fitch's mortgage analysis to reflect borrower refinancing risk upon the loans' contractual maturity and a higher portion of newly originated loans in the cover pool versus the 2016 review. The impact on each cover pool varies and depends on the proportion of unseasoned mortgages in the pool. Apart from a higher credit loss, the 'AAA' breakeven AP for one program is also affected by a higher asset disposal loss due to a concentrated liability profile with 68% of the bonds maturing within 12 months of each other. The rating cushion of the covered bond rating against a downgrade of the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of the issuer has increased to 4.5 notches on average (former criteria: two notches) as a result of a higher rating uplift afforded by the payment continuity uplift of six notches. However, the cushion between the committed AP and the 'AAA' breakeven AP is limited in general. Three out of six programs have no AP cushion. As a result, the covered bond ratings are more sensitive to an adverse change in the 'AAA' breakeven AP than the downgrade of an IDR. The forthcoming Canadian advanced bank resolution regime is generally positive to the covered bond programs in Canada. Currently, no Canadian covered bond programs enjoy an IDR uplift because the final rules of the Canadian advanced bank resolution regime is yet to be finalized. Should the final rules confirm that covered bonds are exempt from bail-in, and Fitch views the cover pool as unlikely to be enforced at the point of an issuer resolution; the risk of covered bond under-collateralization is low; and the IDR is not support driven, Fitch could assign an IDR uplift of up to two notches to the covered bond programs for issuers subject to the bail-in regime. Should an IDR uplift of two notches be assigned, the 'AAA' breakeven AP could potentially increase to the legal maximum AP for issuers rated at least 'AA-'.

Downgrades of the tech sector coupled with a slump in Apple's share price on a report that iPhones to be launched this year will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones, sparked a selloff in tech shares that knocked Wall Street on Friday and spread to Europe and Asia on Monday. Europe's tech stocks were down more than 4 percent as Apple, a bellwether for the sector globally, fell another 3.8 percent at a seven-week low, piling further pressure on the sector. Chipmakers, which supply to Apple and other smartphone companies bore the brunt of the selloff in Europe. Shares of STMicro fell 10 percent while Dialog Semi slumped more than 7 percent.  The tech sell-off seems driven by a more cautious view on Apple,  said Colin McLean, managing director at SVM Asset Management. Shares of Austrian chipmaker AMS, which supplies Apple and Samsung, skidded 11.5 percent, but have still more than doubled in value this year. Brokers including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan have stepped up warnings in recent weeks on how much further the rally in cyclical stocks -- or those most geared to economic growth, such as banks, industrials and technology -- has to run. Morgan Stanley downgraded its view on the European tech sector to  underweight  last week citing valuations, while Goldman Sachs published a similarly cautious view on U.S. tech stocks on Friday. Shares of U.S. tech stalwarts Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet continued to fall on Monday after taking a hammering on Friday, sparking fears of broader market weakness.  This is the nature of the tech sector. Valuations do from time to time become very stretched and they come back, and anyone who has paid a very high valuation might experience some short-term pain,  said Fergus Shaw, partner at Cerno Capital. Valuations Not Yet Exuberant In Europe, the regional tech index finished last week at its highest level in 15 years, easily outpacing other sectors, after rallying 24 percent this year. Stock valuations are at their highest since 2004, and above their 15-year average. Still, at 21 times forward earnings, they remain well short of the dizzying heights reached during the dotcom boom and bust when valuations hit more than 70 times. Investors pointed to broader understanding of the tech sector as a potential guard against similar exuberance developing today.  Valuations are not as eye-watering as they were during the tech bubble. Back then it was a minority of people who appreciated the disruptive, transformative nature of technology,  said Shaw.  The market as a whole is better able to deal with these companies now.  Semiconductor makers were some of the worst hit due to their high liquidity.  Some of the liquid, very obvious momentum names can be punished hard when any short term momentum changes, and it can also lead to contagion for others,  said Neil Campling, head of technology research at Northern Trust. Cybersecurity stocks Micro Focus and Sophos were also among top fallers in the UK. With this year's best performing sector down sharply there are worries that weakness could spread to other economically sensitive stocks where resurgent investor interest has also pushed up valuations. Morgan Stanley strategists said last week that cyclical stocks' weighting in the MSCI Europe index was at a 20-year high, and a couple of percentage points off their tech-bubble peak. They recommended investors switch into dividend-paying sectors such as real estate and telecoms which have been out of favour this year.

Firm veterans Ben Jacobs and Ning Jin will become co-chief investment officers, the firm told investors in a letter sent on Monday. Sundheim's departure comes just months after the prominent hedge fund's flagship portfolio suffered its biggest annual loss ever in 2016 and founder Andreas Halvorsen told investors in January he was shifting the way capital was allocated. The firm will return money from the Viking Global Equities LP and the Viking Long Fund LP funds, according to the letter. Many hedge funds have struggled to deliver top returns in the last few years and some industry analysts suggest they might perform better if they had less capital to invest. A number of large hedge fund managers, including David Tepper and Seth Klarman, have returned capital to investors from time to time if they were not seeing new investment opportunities.

Statoil has invested more than $10 billion in Brazil, making it the country's largest foreign offshore operator. The Peregrino heavy oilfield 85 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro is the biggest it operates outside Norway. With Peregrino producing 80,000-90,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day, Statoil's 60 percent equity stake in the field currently leaves the company with 48,000-54,000 barrels in daily output from the South American country.  We expect (Statoil's) equity production to more than triple in Brazil going towards 2030,  Anders Opedal, Statoil's head of Brazilian operations, told Reuters in an interview, referring to the company's share of production. Last year, Statoil bought a 66 percent stake and became the operator of the BM-S-8 licence in the Santos Basin, including parts of Carcara, from state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) for $2.5 billion. The Norwegian firm also took operating control of the BM-C-33 licence in the Campos basin from Repsol Sinopec, holding a 35 percent stake. Statoil has also approved the Peregrino phase 2 development, which is expected to add 250 million barrels of reserves at a break-even price of below $45 a barrel, down from an original estimate of $70 a barrel.  We are on track to start the third platform at Peregrino at end-2020,  Opedal said. Future Plans Statoil plans to drill one exploration well on a separate prospect in the BM-S-8 licence this year, before moving to test flows at nearby Carcara in 2018. Statoil may also take part in Brazil's upcoming auction round in so-called pre-salt formations on October 27, which will include parts of the Carcara discovery.  We have a very strong desire to be the operator for the totality of the Carcara discovery,  Opedal said. Meanwhile, the company was still evaluating options for developing the BM-C-33 licence in the Campos Basin, where three discoveries have revealed an estimated one billion barrels of oil equivalents.  This is another field, which is going to be part of Statoil's core production (in Brazil),  Opedal said, declining to give any timetable for investment decisions. The Campos Basin accounts for about 80 percent of Brazil's oil production. (Editing by Terje Solsvik and Keith Weir)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/statoil-brazil-idUSL8N1J940G"},

The march ended with a rally and speeches by Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives; Mayor Eric Garcetti; and actor and drag queen icon RuPaul. Despite the  sharper focus on political issues this year, the event remained at its core a celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identity. It was one of dozens of pride events scheduled in major cities across the United States this month. Trump has antagonized many minorities since taking office in January. A ReaClearPolitics average of opinion polls show his approval rating is currently 39 percent, although he retains strong support among Republicans.

Jao Belanders, 22  Why so much hate? It baffles me how someone can have so much hate in their heart and inequality and think that's OK and that's power.

The investigation committee, commissioned by President John Magufuli, recommended that the gold miner pay outstanding taxes and royalties, and called for a review of mining laws and government ownership in mines.  Acacia strongly refutes these new unfounded accusations. We have always conducted our business to the highest standards and operated in full compliance with Tanzanian law,  the London-listed company, Tanzania's biggest miner and largest foreign investor, said in a statement. Acacia has been caught up in Magufuli's campaign to reform the mining industry, a key source of foreign exchange for the East African country. The sector accounts for about 4 percent of Tanzania's gross domestic product. Tanzania banned the export of unprocessed ore in March and has pushed for the construction of a local smelter. Shares in Acacia Mining had fallen 13 percent to 261.78 pence in London by 1433 GMT. Acacia's value has nearly halved since the export ban took effect.  Enough is enough ... we need investors, but not this kind of exploitation. We are supposed to share profits,  Magufuli said in a televised address. He said the investigation also found Acacia was not registered to operate in Tanzania and that the country lost up to 108.5 trillion shillings ($49 billion) in revenue from exports of gold and copper concentrates between 1998 and 2017. The first audit committee, reviewing exports of gold and copper concentrate, said last month it had found 10 times more gold in Acacia's containers than the company had declared as well as undeclared minerals such as iron and sulphur. The chairman of the investigating team, Nehemia Osoro, said in a televised presentation to the president that the government must own stakes in all large mining projects and recommended a review of all mining contracts and laws. Investec analyst Hunter Hillcoat called the committee's findings  implausible , adding that the motives of the Tanzanian government were unclear.  Whether that motive is nationalization or a grab for more taxes or a share of the mines - no one knows yet. The market is understandably pricing in risk.  Acacia said it remained open to talking with the government. Magufuli said if Acacia  confess that they have been looting the country, the government is ready to do business . Barrick Gold, which owns 63.9 percent of Acacia, said in a statement it believed a negotiated resolution would be the best outcome to the dispute. $1 = 2,233.0000 Tanzanian shillings Writing by Duncan Miriri and Zandi Shabalala; Editing by Edmund Blair and Dale Hudson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/acacia-mining-tanzania-idUSL8N1J91MB"},

The march ended with a rally and speeches by Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives; Mayor Eric Garcetti; and actor and drag queen icon RuPaul. Despite the  sharper focus on political issues this year, the event remained at its core a celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identity. It was one of dozens of pride events scheduled in major cities across the United States this month. Trump has antagonized many minorities since taking office in January. A ReaClearPolitics average of opinion polls show his approval rating is currently 39 percent, although he retains strong support among Republicans. Here are portraits of some of those who took part in the march through Los Angeles. One of two Reuters photographers among the crowd asked what each of them would say if given 30 seconds to sit down with Trump.

Samantha Jaque-Anton, 16  I'd talk to him about how difficult it is to live in a place where people are discriminated against and ask him to look at the world through our eyes and my eyes and my mother's eyes and all my friends around me and to see how his America has changed us.  Jao Belanders, 22  Why so much hate? It baffles me how someone can have so much hate in their heart and inequality and think that's OK and that's power. As president, he should be a leader who inspires hope and change for the better and not influence people to think negatively of other people. It breaks my heart to see that.  Dalyan Johnston, 14, Lisa Rubio, 51, and Isabel Balboa, 50 Balboa:  He's not going to change, so we're going to change America because he's not going to change us.

Allen said:  If Trump had been transparent from the word go at lot of this wouldn't have happened and clearly he has something to hide because he's not transparent. It's just really telling and it's just unfortunate that we have to do these things and march. It's very sad that we're going backwards; it's very disappointing.

However, growth will slow to around 1 percent in 2018-20, the IMF said in a report following its annual Article IV meetings with the Italian authorities, reiterating its frequent calls for Rome to adopt urgent structural reforms.  Weak productivity and low aggregate investment remain key challenges for faster growth, held back by structural weaknesses, high public debt, and impaired bank balance sheets,  the report said. Italy's public debt, at around 132 percent of gross domestic product, is the highest in the euro zone after Greece's, and its banks are weighed down by some 350 billion euros ($391.93 billion) of soured loans. The IMF's improved growth outlook for this year, compared with its 0.8 percent forecast made in April, follows a better-than-expected first quarter, when the economy expanded by 0.4 percent from the previous three months.  The overarching challenge is to boost productivity, which requires more ambitious policy efforts and broad and sustained political support,  the IMF said. Its new 2017 growth forecast is higher than that of the government of Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, which sees expansion of just 1.1 percent. However, if achieved it would still leave Italy in its customary position among the most sluggish euro zone economies. Gentiloni's administration is backed by a broad but fragile coalition and there is frequent speculation that it may collapse in the autumn, leading to a general election some six months ahead of the end of the legislature in May 2018. On public finances, the IMF called Italy's official target of reducing the budget deficit to 1.2 percent of gross domestic product next year  appropriate , although the government recently proposed making the goal less ambitious. The target for this year's deficit-to-GDP ratio is 2.1 percent.    ($1 = 0.8930 euros) (Reporting By Gavin Jones)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/italy-economy-imf-idUSR1N1FE00D"},

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.     May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a  hard Brexit  -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.  Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.   The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,  a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.   That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.   A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.  The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.   It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could â if not addressed immediately â be disastrous for the UK economy,  said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.  The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year's Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.  Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year's Brexit vote.  And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.  Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.  Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a 'softer Brexit', with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.   Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn't think used to happen in the UK,  CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.   But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.   Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.  Left in Limbo  Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.  Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.  Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britainâs biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered  uncharted waters  in terms of how many new cars it could sell.  And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world's largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant  weak investment and postponement of decision making.    Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,  he said.  Bankers, at the heart of London's huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.   So long as uncertainty is there I don't see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,  Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.  Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.   I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.

The pound slid to its lowest for nearly two months on Friday after shock election results left Prime Minister Theresa May short of a parliamentary majority and facing calls to step down. Having gained a third of a percent in Asian trading, the pound fell steadily throughout the European morning, sinking by almost 1 percent on the day to 88.66 pence per euro, its weakest since early November. EURGBP=D3  It fell over half a percent against the dollar to $1.2659, just a quarter of a cent above intraday lows hit on Friday GBP=D3.  May reappointed most of her ministers on Sunday but brought a Brexit campaigner and party rival into government to try to unite her Conservatives. She is in talks with Northern Irish unionists to allow her to stay in power.  The market's continuing to digest the election result which in our view is consistent with near-term downside risks to the pound,  said Sam Lynton-Brown, currency strategist with BNP Paribas. He added that increased uncertainty in the short term was encouraging investors to rebuild  short  bets against the pound, after they retreated from record highs over the past month. [IMM/FX] While the motivations behind the pound's performance since Friday have been muddy, most analysts now say the pound is benefiting from the assumption that Thursday's rebuke for May will soften Britain's approach to Brexit talks. A number of leading Conservatives on Monday stressed that membership of the European Union's single market - in exchange for freedom of movement for European workers - was not on the table. Traders assume the political machinations of the coming weeks and months may spur change on that front.  The Conservative Party's reduced share of the vote may indicate a higher likelihood that a 'softer' form of Brexit might now be pursued, involving compromises with the EU that Ms May would not have countenanced previously, and which would be positive,  analysts at ratings firm Moody's wrote in a note. They said the election outcome was a negative for the UK's credit profile. Six-month sterling/dollar risk-reversals, a measure of the balance in the market between bets on a currency rising or falling, stood at -1.3 GBP6MRR=ICAP according to ICAP data.

A survey from the Resolution Foundation think tank showed almost half of British employers are unprepared for the government's planned changes to immigration rules after Brexit. Another survey showed British business confidence falling sharply, while figures from credit card network Visa indicated British consumers cut spending for the first time in nearly four years last month. Investors' will now watch for readings on inflation, wage growth, unemployment, and retail sales this week - all of which will play into the Bank of England's stance on record-low UK interest rates due on Friday.

The interior ministry named the two as Lee Zing Yang, 24, and Meng Li Si, 26, and said their violation of visa rules had contributed to their abductions. Previously officials said they were Chinese-language teachers. The two were abducted by armed men pretending to be policemen on May 24 in Quetta, the provincial capital of Baluchistan province. Last week, Islamic State's Amaq news agency said its members had killed them.  Instead of engaging in any business activity, they went to Quetta and under the garb of learning (the) Urdu language from a Korean national ... were actually engaged in preaching,  the ministry said in a statement.  It did not say what kind of preachers they were, nor did it say if the Korean was from North Korea or South Korea.  The interior ministry confirmed the two Chinese had been  killed but it was not clear if their bodies have been found. The kidnapping was a rare crime against Chinese nationals in Pakistan, which has long had close ties to Beijing, but it has alarmed the growing Chinese community in the country. China has pledged to invest $57 billion in Pakistan in projects linked to its  Belt and Road  infrastructure plan aimed at linking China with the Middle East and Europe. But the infusion of cash has come with frequent requests for Pakistan to improve security, especially in the western Baluchistan province that will house a deepwater port and a road artery vital for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPC). The incident has prompted Pakistan to boost security around Chinese nationals and other foreigners, and accelerated plans for thousands-strong special police protection units to focus on safeguarding Chinese citizens. Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said in response to the case that there should be a review of the visa process for Chinese nationals entering Pakistan, and for a databank to track Chinese workers in different parts of the country. Khan ordered the databank to be  shared with all security agencies , his ministry said in a statement. At present, Chinese citizens are able to obtain visas faster than other nationals, and for longer periods when their work relates to CPEC projects.  Khan said the government must work on keeping visitors secure but also appeared to try to shift the blame for the security lapse onto the Chinese nationals, saying they should have informed the authorities of their activities.  The Minister observed that it is highly unfortunate that a misuse of the terms of (the) business visa contributed to the unfortunate incident of abduction and subsequent murder of two innocent Chinese,  the ministry said.

The European Commission would agree at a regular meeting to send so-called letters of formal notice to Poland and Hungary, three diplomats and EU officials told Reuters. Two others said the Czech Republic was also on the list. This would mark a sharp escalation of the internal EU disputes over migration. Such letters are the first step in the so-called infringement procedures the Commission can open against EU states for failing to meet their legal obligations. The eastern allies Poland and Hungary have vowed not to budge. Their staunch opposition to accepting asylum-seekers, and criticism of Brussels for trying to enforce the scheme, are popular among their nationalist-minded, eurosceptic voters. Speaking in Hungary's parliament earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said:  We will not give in to blackmail from Brussels and we reject the mandatory relocation quota.  A spokeswoman in Brussels did not confirm or deny the executive would go ahead with the legal cases, but referred to an interview that Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker gave to the German weekly Der Spiegel last week.  Those that do not take part have to assume that they will be faced with infringement procedures,  he was quoted as saying. Poland and Hungary have refused to take in a single person under a plan agreed in 2015 to relocate 160,000 asylum-seekers from Italy and Greece, which had been overwhelmed by mass influx of people from the Middle East and Africa.  Poland's Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak was quoted as saying on Monday by the state news agency PAP:  We believe that the relocation methods attract more waves of immigration to Europe, they are ineffective.  The Czech Republic had initially taken in 12 people from their assigned quota of 2,691, but said earlier in June it would take no more in, citing security concerns. A series of deadly Islamist attacks in western Europe since late 2015 has put the spotlight on public security and the easterners say hosting people from the mainly-Muslim Middle East and North Africa increases risks to safety.  Deepening Divides The bloc has fought two years of these bitter migration battles but the two southern states, backed by rich countries like Germany and Sweden that are the final destinations for many  refugees and migrants arriving in the EU, have failed to force Warsaw and Budapest to change their policies.  With others also dragging their feet, the scheme has been a failure and fewer than 21,000 people have been moved so far. Immigration numbers have fallen since the height of the crisis in 2015 after a deal with Turkey, leaving the dispute largely a political one.  Only Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic do not have pledges pending to accept asylum-seekers under the plan.  That allows the Commission to single them out on that formal basis, rather than open legal cases against just about every EU state for failing to take in the whole of their assigned quota. In his interview, Juncker said:  The decision hasn't been made yet, but I will say this: I am for it - not to make a threat, but to make clear that decisions that have been made are applicable law ... At issue here is European solidarity, which cannot be a one-way street.  Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania opposed agreeing to the relocation scheme for asylum-seekers in 2015 but were outvoted. Although generally opposed, Poland eventually voted with the majority. Budapest and Bratislava have since challenged the system in the European Union's top court, and are backed by Warsaw. The court is due to present a first opinion on the matter in July. The Commission will decide on the new infringements at a weekly meeting on Tuesday, and they could formally be launched a day later, the sources said, paving the way for many months - or even years - of legal wrangling before any court sanctions.  The bloc's divisive migration disputes have come at a time its unity and resolve are already being tested by Brexit, weak economies and higher support for populist, eurosceptic and nationalist-minded parties on the continent.  It pits the formerly communist easterners against the wealthy westerners and countries on the Mediterranean coast, with Italy leading calls to punish Poland and Hungary by taking away some of the generous EU funds they benefit from. Warsaw and Budapest have numerous other disputes open with the bloc's political capital Brussels and the Western states promoting more open world views. They have clashed over the rule of law, democratic checks and balances and the two government's moves to subdue the judiciary and public media, among others.

Piraeus, COSCO Shipping and Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG) have agreed to cooperate in project planning, staff training and information exchange, Piraeus said in a statement on Monday. It said the agreement would create synergies to boost trade and create new business opportunities. Shanghai is China's main gateway port to the world and had a throughput of 36.5 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent container units) in 2015.  The agreement means that huge quantities of goods will be transported to Piraeus from Shanghai,  Deputy Economy Minister Stergios Pitsiorlas said on the sidelines of the event. China has been investing heavily in Greece in recent years. COSCO bought a 51 percent stake in Piraeus Port for 280.5 million euros ($314 million) last year under its plan to make Greece a transhipment hub for rapidly growing trade between Asia and Eastern Europe. It has the option to buy another 16 percent after five years once it completes mandatory investments of 300 million euros to upgrade infrastructure. COSCO has been managing two of the port's cargo piers since 2009 and has helped Piraeus shoot up the world rankings of container ports to 44th biggest in 2015 from 93rd in 2010. Piraeus had a throughput of 3,750 million TEUs last year and expects this to exceed 4 million this year. COSCO plans to increase the volume to 5 million by 2018 and aims to also increase cruise traffic from 1 million passengers a year to 1.5 million in the short term.

Policymakers in Latin America's fourth-largest economy reduced rates by a quarter point in late May following a 50 basis-point cut in April. However, the board had been divided between those concerned about a further climb in inflation and those worried about growth figures.  On the growth side the economy is slowing down or not growing much, and on the inflation side we have good news but not good enough,  Echavarria told Reuters in an interview. But he added:  We hope we can decrease 100 additional (basis) points throughout the rest of the year.  Colombia's economy, which has been hit hard by the slump in global oil prices, grew 1.1 percent in the first quarter, below the central bank's estimate of 1.3 percent. Meanwhile, data showed consumer prices rose at a slower pace in May with annual inflation at 4.37 percent, closer to the central bank's long-term target of 2-4 percent. Echavarria himself has described 3 percent as an ideal target.   My bigger concern is always inflation because we are still far from 3 percent,  he said, adding that while falling food prices would eventually help drive inflation down to 3 percent by late-2018, room for policy easing could in the meantime be limited.  If we want to be close to 3 percent, this is not going to be very easy, so I fear we will be on the restrictive side most of the time.  Echavarria was optimistic economic growth could come in slighlty above the central bank's forecast of 1.8 percent in 2017. The rate of expansion could speed up to 2.5 percent next year helped by a revival in tourism and the agricultural sector. Recent meetings with business people across the country had painted an uneven picture, Echavarria said.  While businesses in the capital Bogota were suffering, a peace deal struck between the government and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) late last year had led to a revival of tourism along the Atlantic coast. The peace deal could allow an extra 0.5 percent of GDP growth per year, Echavarria estimated. On the other hand, presidential and legislative elections in 2018 would add uncertainty, he warned.   It will be difficult to undertake meaningful structural reform during the next year.  While Colombia - like much of Latin America - depends heavily on the performance of the U.S. economy, Echavarria expected little impact from U.S. interest rate rises.   We see U.S. companies are investing,  he said.  I hope (U.S. President Donald) Trump's ideas about trade will not be too terrible for the U.S. economy.

Tourists looking for ever more thrilling holidays are taking to the skies above Texas to shoot wild hogs as part of the state's effort to limit the spread of an invasive species that annually causes millions of dollars in damage to farmland and livestock nationally.  For up to $50,000, people can hunt the feral hogs from a helicopter and even use a machine gun to mow them down.  There's only so many places in the world you can shoot machine guns out of a helicopter and no one shoots back,  said Chris Britt, co-owner of HeliBacon, one of the companies offering the aerial hog hunts. HeliBacon says its customers alone gunned down about 10,000 feral hogs in the last 18 months, but that barely makes a dent in the Texas' population of more than 2 million, a total higher than any other state.      There were 2,752 helicopter hog hunts in Texas last year, up 81 percent from 2011, according to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department data. About 34,400 hogs were killed in those hunts, up 53 percent.  The total U.S. population of the hogs is estimated at more than 6 million, and state and federal government officials are increasing efforts to rid themselves of the pesky animals. There are nearly 150 companies and individuals permitted to hunt invasive feral hogs from helicopters as part of the Texas' so-called pork chopper bill passed in 2011. State legislators last month sent a bill to Governor Greg Abbott that would allow hog hunting from hot air balloons. Vulture Food      At HeliBacon, based south of Dallas, packages for two start at about $3,600 and corporate group packages cost as much as $50,000, including airfare, lodging, ammunition, trophy photos and upgrades from semi- to fully automatic firearms.  They love it,  Britt said of his customers that include father-and-son trips and groups from the oil industry.  They don't take the meat, it becomes vulture food.

Courtesy Helibacon/Handout via REUTERSAnimals rights activists are not fans.  The Humane Society of the United States opposes the use of aerial gunning â whether from a helicopter or a hot air balloon â as a means of resolving conflicts with wildlife populations because it is unnecessarily cruel, dangerous and costly compared to other wild pig control methods,  said Samantha Hagio, a director at the agency. However, aerial hunting is one of the most effective ways to eradicate hogs in open areas such as Texas fields of corn and rice that are destroyed, said Jack Mayer, manager of environmental sciences at Georgia's Savannah River Laboratory and author of  Wild Pigs in the United States.  Slideshow (3 Images)Even so, hunting and trapping are not keeping up with the rate of breeding and the feral herd continues to grow.  You are not even stemming the tide,  Mayer said by phone. Wild boars were brought to Texas and released for hunting in the 1930s. They bred with free-ranging domestic animals and escapees that had adapted to the wild, according to the Smithsonian. Since hogs, wild or otherwise, are not native to the United States, they have no predators and proliferated across Texas and other states.   About $25.55 million was appropriated this year to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to tackle feral hogs on the national level and the agency is testing unmanned drones to track the hogs that thrive in swamps and forests, said Dale Nolte, the USDA's feral swine program manager. Helicopter hunting already is allowed in Louisiana and Oklahoma legislators are considering a bill that would permit aerial hunts there.  Hot air balloons could allow hunters to approach hogs more quietly than a helicopter or give shooters a steadier shot, Mayer said. In South Carolina, where aerial hog hunting is not permitted, farmer Rusty Kinard pays a local hunter $25 for each hog killed on his land. Still, there are hundreds near his fields and the hogs ate through nearly 30 acres (12 hectares) of peanuts last month.  We will kill them suckers, every one we can,  he said.

Banking regulators from across the world meet on Wednesday and Thursday in Sweden in a fresh attempt to get agreement on completing Basel III, a set of tougher capital requirements initiated in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis. But no final deal is likely this week given that France, backed by Germany and the Netherlands, is unhappy with the package on the table, which aims to ensure that banks are consistent in how they measure risks from loans to determine capital buffers, bankers and other sources said on Monday.  We are not going to get a deal,  one person familiar with the Basel Committee negotiations said. The main stumbling block is a proposed  floor  which would mean capital cannot fall below 75 percent of the  standard  approach set out by regulators and used by most lenders, while big banks use models to add up risks instead.  Some are unhappy about the 75 percent because it is too high, some don't like it because it is too low, but everyone has signalled a willingness to agree on a certain number,  the person said. France, Germany, the Netherlands and the European Commission have submitted a joint position to Basel which says the 75 percent floor in not acceptable, a second person close to the matter said.  It's a relatively united European front,  the person said. A legislative proposal from the commission, backed by countries such as like France and Germany, would be needed to implement the Basel package. While European banks fear they will have to find significant amounts of extra capital under what they dub Basel IV, the United States does not want the floor set too low. The Bank of France, a member of the Basel Committee, referred on Monday to comments by its governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau in May when he said he wanted to complete a Basel package based on improved and better supervised internal models.  It is better to give it some time to reach a good agreement than to rush to bad arrangements,  de Galhau said last month. A Paris-based banking executive said he wanted to ask French President Emmanuel Macron for a global moratorium on new capital rules at the G20 level, although bankers also fear that France could end up being isolated. The hope is that enough progress is made this week for it to be referred for the second time this year to Basel's oversight body to broker a final deal before momentum runs out.  There is a clear sense of fatigue,  the person said. Basel has already signalled that the package could take up to a decade to come in to soften the hit to a few  outliers .

The San Francisco-based lender hired Mayo to make calls on large-cap bank stocks in its securities business, according to a statement released on Monday.  Mike's stature in the industry is well-recognized,  Diane Schumaker-Krieg, global head of research, economics and strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, said in a statement.  We are thrilled to have such an influential voice in this critical sector join our growing platform.  Matthew Burnell, who had covered bank stocks at Wells Fargo for over a decade, is leaving, spokeswoman Jessica Ong said. Mayo has garnered a reputation as a blunt critic of bad behavior in the industry who spots trouble early. Since the early 1990s, he has made several savvy calls on stocks before banks - individually or as a sector - faced huge losses. His more famous downgrades happened ahead of the dot-com bubble bursting near the turn of the century, as well as the more recent subprime mortgage crisis. Mayo has a tendency to ask pointed questions during conference calls and investor events, making himself a thorn in the side of top executives at Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, among others. He turned up at JPMorgan's most recent investor day less than 24 hours after losing his job at brokerage CLSA, identifying himself as a  free agent.  He then asked Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon what Mayo called a  trick question  about the bank's brand. Dimon responded by telling an anecdote about Mayo having been banned from participating in analyst calls at another bank because management found him to be  insulting.  But, Dimon said, the problems Mayo highlighted were correct, and his criticism ultimately helped the bank improve.  You are a brand, too, Mike Mayo,  said Dimon.  You didn't need CLSA.  Wells Fargo itself is in the midst of an overhaul after revelations emerged last year that thousands of employees had opened as many as 2.1 million accounts in customers' names without their permission to hit aggressive sales targets. The sales abuses led to a $185 million fine, a CEO departure and weakness in its share price. As an analyst working at Wells Fargo, Mayo will no longer be covering the bank.

Although Puerto Rico voted overwhelmingly in favor of statehood, low voter turnout may weaken Governor Ricardo Rossello's case for statehood in Washington, where Puerto Rico is seen as a low priority. Puerto Rico's two main opposition parties boycotted Sunday's vote. The mainly Spanish speaking island has $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate, woefully underperforming schools and near-insolvent pension and health systems. Last month, the territory filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Rossello, who became governor in January, had campaigned for statehood as the best path out of the island's financial troubles. Yet eight out of 10 Puerto Ricans did not cast a vote in Sunday's plebiscite, many because they did not believe the non-binding referendum would sway Congress.  We're bankrupt and 85 percent of us don't speak English. Why would the U.S. government want to take on a problem like Puerto Rico?  said Carolina Santos, a single working mother struggling to make her mortgage payment and cover other bills.  This is the fifth time there's been a referendum on statehood. Nothing's going to change. Maybe we should focus more on fixing our financial problems and our schools,  said Santos.

When a band of militants led by Omarkhayam and one of his brothers over-ran a town in the southern Philippines on May 23, festooning its alleyways with the black banners of Islamic State, the Facebook description seemed appropriate. Governments across Southeast Asia had been bracing for the time when Islamic State, on a back foot in Iraq and Syria, would look to establish a 'caliphate' in Southeast Asia and become a terrifying threat to the region.  The Middle East seems a long way away but it is not. This is a problem which is amidst us,  Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Australian radio on Saturday as the battle to re-take Marawi neared the end of the third week, with a death toll of nearly 200.  It is a clear and present danger.  Omarkhayam and Abdullah Maute grew up with several other brothers and sisters in Marawi, a Muslim-majority town in a country where over 90 percent of the population is Christian. Marawi is, historically, the center of Islam on Mindanao, a sprawling island where violent resistance to authority has been a tradition since the era of Spanish colonialism, spurred in recent decades by poverty and the neglect of successive governments. As teenagers in the 1990s, the brothers seemed like ordinary young men, said a neighbor of the Maute family: they studied English and the Koran, and played basketball in the streets.  We still wonder why they fell to the Islamic State,  said the neighbor, who was once an Islamist militant himself and surrendered to the government.  They are good people, religious. When someone gets to memorize the Koran, it's unlikely for them to do wrong. But this is what happened to the brothers.  In the early 2000s, Omarkhayam and Abdullah studied in Egypt and Jordan, respectively, where they became fluent in Arabic. Omarkhayam went to Al-Azhar University in Cairo, where he met the daughter of a conservative Indonesian Islamic cleric. After they married, the couple returned to Indonesia. There,  Omarkhayam taught at his father-in-law's school, and in 2011 he settled back in Mindanao. It may have been then, and not when he was in the Middle East, that Omarkhayam was radicalized.  In Cairo  none of his fellow students saw him as having any radical tendencies at all, and photographs show a young man enchanted by his baby daughters and playing with the growing family by the Red Sea,  Jakarta-based anti-terrorism expert Sidney Jones wrote in a 2016 report. Little is known about Abdullah's life after he went to Jordan, and it is not clear when he returned to Lanao del Sur, the Mindanao province that includes Marawi. Intelligence sources said there are seven brothers and one half-brother in the family, all but one of whom joined the battle for Marawi. Smart, Articulate The Mautes were a monied family in a close-knit tribal society where respect, honor and the Koran are paramount.  Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera said the 'Maranao' clan, to which the Mautes belong, has a matriarchal tradition, and so their mother played a central role. He said Farhana Maute, who according to the neighbor had furniture and used-car businesses, helped finance the group, and she drove recruitment and radicalization of local youths. On Friday, she was stopped outside Marawi in a vehicle loaded with firearms and explosives and taken into custody. It was a major blow for the militants, according to Herrera, as she had been the  heart of the Maute organization .  Men identified by Philippines Intelligence officers as Isnilon Hapilon (2nd L, yellow headscarf) and Abdullah Maute (2nd R, standing, long hair) are seen in this still image taken from video released by the Armed Forces of the Philippines on June 7, 2017.    Armed Forces of the Philippines/Handout via REUTERS TVA day previously, the brothers' father, an engineer, was arrested in Davao City, 250 km (155 miles) away.  When the Marawi siege began, several hundred militants were involved, including men from nations as far away as Morocco and Yemen. But most of the marauders, who took civilians as human shields and torched the town cathedral, were from four local groups allied to Islamic State, and in the lead were the Maute, military officials said. According to Jones, the Maute group has  the smartest, best-educated and most sophisticated members  of all the pro-Islamic State outfits in the Philippines. Samira Gutoc-Tomawis, a local civic leader who knows some of the Maute's extended family, said the brothers rely heavily on social media to recruit young followers and spread their  rigid and authoritarian  ideology.  The Mautes are very active online. On YouTube, they upload their ideas  she said.  They are articulate, they are educated, they are idealistic.  The Maute family's neighbor, who requested anonymity for his own safety, said the group's fighters are fearless too. Slideshow (4 Images)He was trapped for five days in his three-storey house last month watching the battle between the militants and the Philippines armed forces unfold, with sniper fire pinging around him and OV-10 aircraft bombing from above.  During the bombing runs of the OV-10, they just carried on  eating biscuits, not running for cover,  he said. On May 28, a group of seven fighters - he recognized Omarkhayam among them - came to his house and asked why he had not left. When he told them that he feared being caught in the crossfire, they guided him and several others to a bridge leading out of town and gave them a white cloth to wave.  I Want to Kill Them Now  The Maute group first surfaced in 2013 with a bombing of a nightclub in nearby Cagayan de Oro. Its stature has grown since then, most notably with the bombing last year of a street market in President Rodrigo Duterte's hometown, Davao City. Maute members who were captured said the Davao attack was ordered by Isnilon Hapilon of Abu Sayyaf, a group that has fought since the 1990s for an independent Islamic province but is as well known as a vicious gang of criminals and kidnappers.  Hapilon, who was last year declared by Islamic State as its 'emir' of Southeast Asia, was seen in a video that emerged last week showing the militants - including two Maute brothers - plotting to seal Marawi off as a separate enclave. Herrera said the Mautes enjoy strong support in Marawi.  This is their place, this is where their family is, this is where their culture is, this is where the heritage is. There is a huge sympathetic perspective towards the ... Maute,  he said. But Khana-Anuar Marabur Jr., a Marawi town councillor, said the Mautes had made enemies in the area with their radicalism. He said he went to the brothers on the day the attack on Marawi was launched and they told him to the leave the town.  They told me to leave because the caliphate ... had ordered it,  Marabur told Reuters.  They treated me like an enemy. I want to kill them now.

I wasn't surprised to hear about the recession. I saw that the economy was going down last year,  said 38-year old Setlhabi, staring at shelves piled high with clothes offered at discount prices.  People don't have money and for those who come in, they buy cheaper items and not the expensive ones.  South Africa sank into recession for the first time in eight years in the first quarter, hit by weakness in consumer sectors such as wholesale, retail and accommodation. The economic turmoil is piling pressure on President Jacob Zuma, who faces calls to step down from within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) as a string of corruption scandals, party infighting and sky-high unemployment erode public support ahead of elections in 2019. The persistence of poverty and joblessness 23 years after the end of apartheid is also stoking anger, with unrest dubbed  service delivery protests  -- taking place frequently. Unemployment is at a 14-year high of 27.7 percent. The government's response to the gradually building economic crisis is due to be laid out later this week when Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba briefs the media how he will address the economic challenges. Economists had expected the economy to expand, helped by a recovery in mining and agriculture, but surprise contractions in the rest of the economy led it to shrink. Rising unemployment, high interest rates and a drop in purchasing power after a drought last year have all driven consumer prices up and hammered consumer confidence.  I used to go into a shop and fill a trolley with groceries to last my family a month but that's not happening anymore,  said 68-year old Mabule Modiba, a retired salesman who recently started driving a taxi to make ends meet.  I thought I was done working, but now I also have to look after my grandchildren because my kids don't have jobs.  South Africa's inflation rose to 7 percent early 2016, breaching the central bank's target of 3-6 percent, but has now eased to 5.3 percent as food price rises slow. The Treasury has said the recession introduced  significant downward bias  to this year's growth estimate of 1.3 percent, up from 0.3 percent in 2016. It means growth is more likely to fall than rise. It also said that any policies introduced to combat the recession would be made within the current budget framework, in which South Africa aims to cut its budget deficit to 3.3 percent of national output in the next three years from the current 3.8 percent. Zuma's Promise To stem falling voter support for the ANC, Zuma has vowed to redistribute economic wealth to the poor, but this will be almost impossible with an economy contracting. The ANC lost major cities in its worst ever local election results last year and opposition parties are becoming increasingly confident of ousting the party of Nelson Mandela at a parliamentary vote in 2019.  What (the recession) does do is show what is at stake,  Nomura analyst Peter Attard Montalto said.  If there canât be reform, we are on this path where the ANC will lose power because they cannot create jobs.  Unbridled lending fuelled a consumer frenzy that helped the South African economy grow by an average 5 percent a year in the five years before the 2009 recession. But stricter lending rules since 2015, which require borrowers to produce bank statements and proof of income before retailers can grant them in-store credit accounts, have excluded some from buying on credit. Results from clothing and furniture retailers such as Mr Price, Truworths and The Foschini Group show they have lost a combined total of 1 billion rand ($78 million) in sales since new rules were implemented. Active credit accounts fell to 54 million in the first three months of the year, from a high of nearly 58 million in 2015.  Consumers had to become conservative and try to live within their means, given the high risk that the economic environment could deteriorate further,  said Elize Kruger, an economist at NKC African Economics. There is no relief in sight for traders like Setlhabi after a central bank official said cutting interest rates was not the answer to dragging South Africa out of recession.  I don't see myself surviving if the economy doesn't pick up,  Setlhabi said.  If nothing changes in the next two to three years, then I will have to sell the shop.

Rates futures prices matched Wall Street's consensus that Fed policymakers would raise key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point to a target range of 1.00-1.25 percent at their upcoming two-day meeting that begins on Tuesday. However, they implied traders have not fully priced in the Fed's target range on rates reaching 1.25-1.50 percent until late 2018. The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-setting group, previously raised rates in March, marking only its third hike since ending its near zero rate policy in December 2015. Speculation on the timing of the Fed's next rate increase after a possible one to be announced in Wednesday comes as traders await more information on the Fed's plan to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. They will also monitor any changes in policymakers' outlook on inflation and rate increases. While Wall Street's top firms widely expect the Fed to raise rates one more time before the end of 2017 after Wednesday, they are split on whether it would happen in September or December, a Reuters poll conducted on June 2 showed.  Details of balance sheet plans potentially released at the June meeting may affect the probability of a September versus a December announcement and associated rate hike 'pause,'  Citi economists Andrew Hollenhorst and Ebrahim Rahbari wrote in a research note on Monday. The FOMC will release its policy statement at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, along with Fed officials' latest quarterly economic and rate estimates. An half hour later, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to appear at a press conference. At 9:31 EDT (1331 GMT), federal funds futures implied traders priced in a 96 percent probability of a rate hike to 1.00-1.25 percent later this week, unchanged from Friday's close , CME Group's FedWatch tool showed. They suggested traders saw about a 24 percent chance of rates rising to 1.25-1.50 percent at the Fed's Sept. 19-20 meeting and a 53 percent chance of such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting .

SYB is the bank subsidiary of Synchrony Financial (SYF, 'BBB-'/Outlook Stable). These notes are the first issuance from the bank, which recently established a global bank note program. KEY RATING DRIVERS VRs, IDRS, AND SENIOR DEBT As per Fitch's Global Bank Rating Criteria, SYB's senior unsecured debt rating is equalized with its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR). Fitch views the issuance favorably, as SYB is demonstrating access to the unsecured debt market through its banking subsidiary, further diversifying its funding sources. The issuance is not expected to materially alter SYF's overall funding mix, and proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Current ratings for SYF and SYB reflect the company's market leading position in the U.S. private-label credit card industry, seasoned management team, consistent operating performance, strong capitalization and liquidity levels, risk-sharing arrangements with retail partners, and increased funding diversity as a result of strong deposit growth at SYB. Ratings remain constrained by SYF's monoline business model, high retail partner concentration, an above-average mix of non-prime borrowers relative to general-purpose card-issuing peers, potential sensitivity of its deposit base to rising interest rates, and relatively short track record operating as a standalone entity. RATING SENSITIVITIES VRs, IDRS, AND SENIOR DEBT The senior unsecured debt rating is primarily sensitive to changes in SYB's Long-Term IDR and would be expected to move in tandem with that rating. Positive ratings momentum for SYF and SYB could be driven by further diversification of retail partners, a meaningful decline in the percentage of the loan portfolio comprised of nonprime borrowers, limited deterioration in credit performance through a market cycle, demonstrated ability to sustain above-average profitability through credit and interest rate cycles, and continued shift in funding mix toward retail deposits. Furthermore, Fitch believes the durability of SYB's internet-based deposit platform in a rising rate environment will be a key consideration in evaluating the strength of the company's funding profile. Positive rating momentum could also develop from the company's ability to successfully execute on its product expansion and diversification strategy over time while maintaining strong underwriting standards and profit margins. Negative rating momentum could develop from the loss of or default by a key retail relationship, substantial credit quality deterioration, a meaningful reduction in capitalization or liquidity, an inability to access the capital markets on reasonable terms for funding, above-average shareholder distributions relative to peers, and/or potential new and more onerous rules and regulations. Negative rating momentum could also be driven by an inability of SYF to maintain its competitive position and earnings prospects in an increasingly digitized payments and consumer lending landscape. Fitch has assigned the following rating: Synchrony Bank -- Senior unsecured debt 'BBB-'. Fitch currently rates SYF and SYB as follows: Synchrony Financial -- Long-Term IDR 'BBB-'; -- Viability Rating 'bbb-'; -- Senior unsecured debt 'BBB-'; -- Short-Term IDR 'F3'; -- Support Rating '5'; -- Support Rating Floor 'NF'. Synchrony Bank -- Long-Term IDR 'BBB-'; -- Viability Rating 'bbb-' -- Short-Term IDR 'F3'; -- Support Rating '5'; -- Support Rating Floor 'NF'; -- Long-Term Deposits 'BBB'; -- Short-Term Deposits 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and some other Arab countries cut diplomatic, travel and trade ties with Qatar last week, accusing it of supporting Iran and funding Islamist groups, accusations Doha denies. The severing of air, sea and land transport links has closed crucial import routes for Qatar and its population of around 2.7 million people who are dependent on imports for most of their food needs. China's COSCO Shipping Lines Co Ltd, Taiwan's Evergreen and Hong Kong Kong's OOCL have suspended container services to and from Qatar. Qatar Ports Management Company (Mwani) announced on Sunday two new shipping services will each run three times a week between Qatar's Hamad Port and the Omani ports of Sohar in the north and Salalah in the south. Oman is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council but takes a relatively independent diplomatic approach to the other five states in the bloc, particularly over Iran, the non-Arab, Shi'ite Muslim state across the Gulf.  It is impossible to confidently predict how the situation will develop, for how long the 'Qatar ban' will remain in place and whether any further restrictions will be implemented,  said Rania Tadros, managing partner with law firm Ince & Co Dubai. Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters, so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport containers from the larger regional port of Jebel Ali in the UAE. Thousands of containers destined for Qatar are still stuck at Jebel Ali, according to Qatari importers. A Qatari food company owner said shipments began arriving on Sunday from Oman, and that some 12 vessels were headed to Qatar from Sohar and Salalah.  There are around 300 containers of fresh and frozen food coming. Some have arrived and the others are on their way,  Ahmed al-Khalaf said. He said containers at Jebel Ali were still stuck, but that others, including from Europe, were being diverted to Oman's ports. The world's no. 1 container line, Maersk of Denmark, said on Monday it would accept new bookings for container shipments to Qatar from Oman. Swiss-based MSC, the world's no. 2 line, said it would deploy a new dedicated shipping service to Qatar from Salalah.  Suppliers are working on trying to route shipments through Oman. There is still a question over whether there will be diplomatic pressure brought to bear on Oman and what impact that could have on this latest effort,  a shipping source said. Iran and Turkey have already flown in food supplies to Qatar as the gas-rich country seeks other sources.

Consumer prices rose by an annual 2.18 percent last month, compared with a 2.99 percent gain in April, data released by the Ministry of Statistics showed on Monday. The rise was lower than the 2.60 percent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, and was the lowest since India started publishing an economy-wide consumer price index in 2012. With headline inflation undershooting the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) mid-term target of 4 percent for the past seven months, pressure has mounted on the central bank to resume interest rate cuts to juice up economic growth that has hit the lowest level in more than two years.  This clearly shows that the (inflation) risk is on the downside,  said Gaurav Dua, research head at brokerage Sharekhan Ltd in Mumbai.  This opens up a scope for rate cut in August.  The policy repo rate has been on hold since October when the RBI lowered it by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent. In a sign Asia's third-largest economy is stabilising after the disruption caused by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's clampdown on the use of cash late last year, industrial production grew 3.1 percent in April from a year earlier, separate data showed. The pace of expansion, however, was slower than a revised 3.8 percent annual rise in March and compared with a 3.0 percent growth forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. Record Harvest At its policy review last week, the RBI left key interest rates unchanged, but lowered inflation projections and delivered a slightly less hawkish policy statement. The central bank now expects retail inflation to range between 2.0-3.5 percent between April and September, lower than its previous forecast of 4.5 percent, and in a range of 3.5-4.5 percent from October-March, down from 5 percent earlier. While falling commodity prices and a rally in the rupee , which has made imports cheaper, have tamped down price pressures, the biggest comfort policymakers are drawing is the forecast of a normal monsoon this summer. Retail food prices fell 1.05 percent last month from a year ago, compared with a 0.61 percent gain in April. Bountiful monsoon rains could result in another bumper harvest for the South Asian nation, which is already sitting on a huge inventory of food grains from last year's record harvest. That prospect, however, will not cheer millions of India's debt-ridden farmers who are struggling with low prices amid a glut of produce such as lentils, oilseeds and cereals. Further falls in prices could compound their woes and fuel discontent that has triggered protests in the big agrarian states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where police shot dead five protesting farmers last week. Rate Outlook Still Uncertain? Even as the outlook for inflation looks benign, another rate cut is not yet a done deal. The RBI remains worried about sticky core inflation, which excludes volatile, food and energy prices, and the risk of higher borrowing by India's federal states to fund billions of dollar of writeoffs in loans to farmers. The western state of Maharashtra, home of financial capital Mumbai, on Sunday agreed to forgive all farm loans in a bid to placate protesting farmers. The rollout of a nationwide goods and service tax from July 1 could also keep the central bank on guard as the new sales tax rates are likely to push up core inflation by 60 basis points, according to an estimate by Nomura. Core inflation in May was around 4.2 percent, lower than 4.4 a month ago.  We do not expect a deeper rate cut or further rate cuts as inflation is close to bottoming out,  said A. Prasanna, an economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai. (Editing by Douglas Busvine and Toby Chopra)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy-cpi-idUSL3N1J93RO"},

At 9:20 a.m. ET (1320 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3444 to the greenback, or 74.38 U.S. cents, up 0.2 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.3432 to C$1.3465. On Friday, it touched its strongest since late May at C$1.3424.     The foreign exchange options market is showing much less risk of a sharp drop in the Canadian dollar than before last November's U.S. presidential election, which could spell bad news for speculators who have heavily shorted the currency.                  Net short positions on the loonie were trimmed for a second straight week to 94,501 contracts as of June 6 from 98,187 a week earlier, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday but held near a record high.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year            dipped 1.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.747 percent, and the 10-year             declined 7 Canadian cents to yield 1.432 percent.     On Tuesday, the 10-year yield had touched its lowest intraday level in nearly seven months at 1.373 percent.

Technology stocks have led a record-setting rally on Wall Street, helped largely by strong quarterly earnings. The S&P; 500 technology index has risen 18.5 percent this year and is on track to register its best yearly performance since 2014. However, the index tumbled 2.7 percent on Friday, sparked by a sharp drop in Apple shares amid reports that the company is using slower modems in upcoming iPhones, compared with those used by rivals. Shares of the world's most valuable publicly-listed company were off 3.5 percent at $143.52 on Monday and weighed the most on all three main indexes. The S&P; technology sector was down 1.34 percent due to declines in closely watched technology stocks, including those of Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet.  We're starting to question valuations of technology (stocks) at these levels and investors are trying to jockey their way around this thought process,  said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Wall Street's major indexes hit all-time highs on Friday, driven by banks and energy stocks but those gains were offset by the tech selloff later in the day. Financials rose 0.5 percent on Monday, while energy was up 1.3 percent, helping cushion some of the impact from the tech rout. At 9:40 a.m. ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 16.93 points, or 0.08 percent, at 21,255.04. The S&P; 500 was down 5.2 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,426.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 62.95 points, or 1.01 percent, at 6,144.97. Shares of General Electric rose 4.8 percent to $29.29 after the company said Jeff Immelt would retire as chief executive and would be replaced by John Flannery, the head of GE healthcare, ending a years-long succession plan. GE was the top stock on the S&P; 500. Coherus BioSciences tumbled 30.2 percent to $14.40 after the FDA denied the approval of its biosimilar for Amgen's Neulasta, which fights infections in cancer patients. Amgen was up 1.5 at $166.61. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,635 to 954. On the Nasdaq, 1,206 issues rose and 1,166 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

Last month, the U.N. appointed experts to lead a fact-finding mission to investigate widespread allegations of killings, rape and torture by security forces against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority who have faced discrimination in largely Buddhist Myanmar for generations. Myanmar has rejected the mission.  It would have created greater hostility between the different communities,  Suu Kyi told reporters in Stockholm after a meeting with Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven.  We did not feel it was in keeping with the needs of the region in which we are trying to establish harmony and understanding, and to remove the fears that have kept the two communities apart for so long.

I think we should really give the commission a chance to show whether or not they have done their work properly instead of condemning from the beginning,  she said. A U.N. report in February said Myanmar's security forces had committed mass killings and gang rapes in a campaign that  very likely  amounted to crimes against humanity and possibly ethnic cleansing.  The report by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights was based on extensive interviews with Rohingya survivors in Bangladesh. About 75,000 Rohingya fled from Myanmar's Rakhine State to Bangladesh to escape a military crackdown last year launched after nine policemen were killed in attacks that Myanmar blamed on Rohingya militants.  More than 200,000 Rohingya had already fled to Bangladesh, many living in official and makeshift camps, straining resources in one of Asia's poorest regions.

A strike at the world's biggest copper mine, Chile's Escondida, and other disruptions initially prompted worries about shortages of the metal used in construction and power transmission, pushing up prices. Analysts polled by Reuters in April expected a copper deficit this year of 17,000 tonnes versus a consensus forecast in January of an 80,000-tonne surplus. But some analysts now say supplies will be adequate and that the market will end the year with a modest excess of metal.  It's a smaller surplus, but it's still essentially a surplus,  said Karen Norton, an analyst with Thomson Reuters GFMS.  There were enough stockpiles during that critical period and there was also the secondary (scrap) offsetting as well.  The benchmark copper price on the London Metal Exchange climbed 12 percent early in the year to a peak of $6,204 a tonne by mid-February as investors fretted over supplies, but it has since given up 7 percent. Big Mines Ramp Up BHP Billiton lifted force majeure this month at Escondida after a strike that lasted 43 days, the longest in Chilean mining history. The second-biggest copper mine, Grasberg in Indonesia, has been ramping up shipments after the government granted an export permit in April following a 15-week outage related to a dispute over mining rights. On Friday, Freeport-McMoRan Inc said it was  on a path  to get a new mining deal with Indonesia this year for Grasberg, although the company continued to grapple with labour problems. While the Grasberg situation has created some uncertainty, other mines such as Chile's Collahuasi have agreed new contracts.  Looking forward, we see limited scope for further major, labour-related supply disruptions this year,  analyst Natasha Kaneva at JPMorgan said in a note. Kaneva forecasts copper mine production to grow by an average of 2.1 percent year-on-year from April to December and the copper price to weaken to $5,000 by the end of the year. Mining operations could also benefit from having had time during the strike to perform extra maintenance, said analyst Vivienne Lloyd at Macquarie. The market remained relatively well-supplied when the two biggest mines were shut after high copper prices late last year drew a wave of scrap metal into the market.  It looks as though the scrap inflow into the market really diluted the impact of the primary shortage, because we saw scrap moving in, not so much into smelter furnaces, but in place of cathode being consumed by the fabricators,  Lloyd said. The flow of scrap is now dissipating, which may support copper prices temporarily, she added.  We saw the second quarter as a bit of a deficit, but we think it will move back towards surplus in the second half,  Lloyd said. In another sign of healthy supply, copper concentrate treatment and refining charges have risen to the highest levels since mid-February, specialist publication Metal Bulletin said. The charges, paid to smelters to process concentrates into metal, move higher when supply rises.

May failed to win a majority in parliament at the election last week, prompting calls for her plan to leave the EU's single market to be watered down, and for some rival lawmakers to demand that the Brexit process be delayed.  Our position is clearly set out, it is clearly set out in a number of places and there has been no change to that,  May's spokesman said, adding that the Brexit minister David Davis had set out the same position earlier on Monday.  Obviously there will be discussions in cabinet but he (Davis) also set out very clearly that we have set out our plans clearly and there is no change to those.  The election result forced May to search for a deal with a small party of Northern Irish politicians, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), to prop up her government and vote through vital legislation.  The talks are ongoing with the DUP, good progress is being made,  the spokesman said.   The first test of any deal is expected to come at the Queen's Speech - a formal occasion at which the government asks parliament to approve its legislative agenda. The speech was scheduled to take place on June 19, but the spokesman said an update would be issued on that subject, without commenting on whether it might be delayed. The BBC reported that the speech would be pushed back a few days. The spokesman said May was still committed to completing the Brexit process inside two years, as originally planned, and that Britain would still be prepared to walk away from negotiations without a deal if necessary.  Our position remains that we want to get the best possible deal for the United Kingdom, we are confident of doing that but of course what you wouldn't wish to do is to agree to anything which would be harmful to the interests of the whole United Kingdom,  he said.

Andy Home","keywords":"Australia,China,Malaysia,New Zealand,Qatar,South Korea,United States,Vietnam,US,ALUMINIUM,PREMIUMS,AHOME,Commentaries,Japan,Aluminium,Base Metals,Financial and Commodity Market Operators (TRBC),Asia / Pacific,English,Government Borrowing Requirement,Metals and Mining (TRBC),Europe,Regulation,United Kingdom,Reports","sector":"","content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Aluminum is still the star of the London Metal Exchange (LME) base metals complex, up by over 12 percent on the start of the year.  After recording a two-year high of $1,981 per tonne in March, LME three-month metal has eased slightly but is largely holding its ground around the $1,900 level.   Compare and contrast with the likes of copper and zinc, both of which have wilted on growing concerns about renewed slowdown in China's construction and manufacturing sectors.  Aluminum is taking a different cue from China, pinning its hopes on what Beijing calls  supply-side reform  to force production cuts in the world's largest producer.  The money men are largely keeping the faith with this narrative, holding a net long position of 167,725 contracts as of June 1. That's down from a peak of more than 200,000 contracts at the end of March, but still high by historical standards, which means since the LME introduced its positioning reports in July 2014.  But should fund managers be worried by indications of softness in the physical market? Graphic on Japanese quarterly premiums:  tmsnrt.rs/2sTTjDx Japan Premium Falls Japanese buyers are in the process of concluding deals for shipments in the third quarter at a premium of $119 per tonne over LME cash prices. That's down from $128 per tonne for second-quarter shipments and marks the end of a broader bounce in premiums over the first half of this year. The drop in Japanese premiums is surprising given a double dose of production disruption in Australia, a key supplier to the Asian market.  Output in the  Oceania  region, which denotes Australia plus the Tomago smelter in New Zealand, slumped by more than 12 percent in the first four months of this year, according to the International Aluminum Institute.  That reflects one outage and one capacity curtailment.  The Portland smelter in the state of Victoria was badly impacted by a power outage in December last year. It lost around two-thirds of its 300,000-tonne per year operating capacity and has only just managed to restore around half of that. Full production is only likely in August, according to majority owner and operator Alcoa. Rio Tinto's majority-owned Boyne smelter in the state of Queensland has trimmed production by around 15 percent or 80,000 tonnes this year after failing to get a sufficiently competitive power supply contract. The scare in the last few days about shipments from the Qatalum smelter in Qatar, another supplier to the Asian region, probably came too late to impact the Q3 premium negotiations. But it may not have mattered much anyway.  Lme Stocks Feed Supply Every indication is that the Asian region is well-supplied, if not oversupplied. In part this is down to the steady flow of metal out of the LME warehouse system.   LME headline aluminum inventory fell by almost 700,000 tonnes last year and it is already down by more than that this year.  Although the unwind of structural load-out queues at the Dutch port of Vlissingen is a key driver of falling stocks, a lot of the recent aluminum activity has taken place at good-delivery locations in Asia. There have been  flash  queues at  Busan in South Korea and Port Klang in Malaysia in recent months.  And only a part of what has been withdrawn from the LME has gone anywhere near a downstream aluminum processor.  Significant tonnages have been moved to the United States to capitalize on what were higher premiums in that market place.  That trade appears to have lost momentum as the Midwest premium has slipped from its first-quarter highs above 10 cents-per-lb ($220 per tonne) to a current 8.5 cents, basis the CME's premium contract.  Which leaves a lot of ex-LME metal sitting in off-market sheds in the Asian region and being drip-fed into the physical market as stocks financing deals expire.  If this were the only pressure point on regional premiums, aluminum bulls wouldn't have much to worry about.  The dynamics behind the LME stocks declines are well understood and this is ultimately no more than a geographical distribution of what everyone knew was already there.  Chinese Exports Crank Back Up A more worrying development is what appears to be a new surge in Chinese exports of semi-manufactured products ( semis ).  The preliminary snapshot of May's trade figures showed aggregate exports of unwrought aluminum and semis rising to 460,000 tonnes from 430,000 tonnes in April. April's exports of semis products at 380,000 tonnes were the largest monthly tally since November 2015 and the implication is that, barring an unlikely burst in exports of either metal or alloy, they rose further in May.  It's not an entirely surprising outcome given lots of evidence China's giant aluminum machine is cranking back up again.  The official figures supplied by the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association show national production rising by 12.5 percent in the first four months of this year. There are plenty of analysts who think even that growth rate looks too slow.  As ever when China generates more aluminum than it can use itself, exports of semis act as a pressure valve.  The impact this time around, however, might be accentuated by the fact that China's outbound flows have shifted shape from Trade Code 7604 (bars, rods and profiles) to Code 7606 (plate, sheet and strip).  Exports of 7604 have in the past been inflated by a significant flow of what the market has dubbed  fake  semis to Vietnam. This material has been on a world tour but is now back in Vietnam, still not in danger of going anywhere near the global supply chain. The fear is that this latest surge in Chinese exports, by contrast, is bona fide product that will have an immediate displacement effect on regional physical market dynamics.  Tension There is a tension building between the bull narrative of future Chinese production cuts and the current acceleration in exports.  Make no mistake. The prospect of significant aluminum production capacity being closed by Chinese policy-makers is an unprecedented supply side shock for aluminum, even if the scale of the threat is still very hard to determine.  But the drop in Japanese premiums suggests that physical availability is growing, not diminishing. And it will continue doing so as long as China pumps out more semis into the world market.  Bulls aren't panicking yet. That much is evident from the LME price. But they may want to keep a close eye on China's export flows over the coming few months.

Some 4 million people died of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and other ailments linked to excess weight in 2015, bringing death rates related to being overweight up 28 percent on 1990, according to the research.  People who shrug off weight gain do so at their own risk,  said Christopher Murray, one of the authors of the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In 2015, excess weight affected 2.2 billion people equal to 30 percent of the world's population, according to the study. Almost 108 million children and more than 600 million adults weighed in as obese, having a body mass index (BMI) above 30, said the research that covered 195 countries. More than 60 percent of fatalities occurred among this group, the study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington found. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared, and is an indication of whether a person is a healthy weight. A BMI score over 25 is overweight, over 30 is obese and over 40 is morbidly obese. According to the World Health Organisation, obesity has more than doubled since 1980, reaching epidemic proportions. Obesity rates among children were increasing faster than among adults in many countries, including Algeria, Turkey, and Jordan, the study said. Meanwhile, almost 800 million people, including 300 million children, go to bed hungry each night, according to the United Nations. Poor diets and sedentary lifestyles were mainly to blame for increasing numbers of overweight people, experts said. Urbanisation and economic development have led to increasing obesity rates also in poor countries where part of the population doesn't have enough to eat, as people ditch traditional, vegetable-rich diets for processed foods.  People are consuming more and more processed foods that are high in sugar and fat and exercising less,  said Boitshepo Bibi Giyose, senior nutrition officer at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Research in Mexico, Brazil, China, South Korea and Britain by London-based Overseas Development Institute has shown that the cost of processed foods like ice cream, hamburgers, chips and chocolate has fallen since 1990, while the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables has gone up.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq was seen opening down 0.8 percent after an almost 2 percent drop on Friday, its third biggest one-day loss of the year.  This is the nature of the tech sector. Valuations do from time to time become very stretched and they come back and anyone who has paid a very high valuation might experience some short-term pain,  said Fergus Shaw, fund manager at Cerno Capital. A near 4 percent slump in Apple on Friday, along with falls in Alphabet, Facebook and others took a heavy toll on rivals including Samsung and Europe's big chipmakers STMicro and Dialog on Monday. While year-to-date Nasdaq gains of more than 15 percent have outperformed the wider market, an ebbing of the Trump reflation trade and a slide in U.S. economic surprises deep into negative territory have prompted some investors to review the mix of their portfolios. Europe's tech index fell 3.5 percent to put it on track for its biggest one-day loss since Britain's Brexit vote a year ago. The index had reached a 15-year high earlier this month having soared around 40 percent over the last year.  It is pretty healthy to have some form of correction in the tech sector to distribute the flows into other sectors,  said ABN AMRO Chief Investment Officer Didier Duret. The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.8 percent, supported by modest gains in oil prices, which lifted shares in energy stocks, and by first round French parliamentary election results which look set to give President Emmanuel Macron a huge majority to push through pro-business reforms. Italy also offered some support after the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement failed to make the run-off vote in almost all the main cities up for grabs in local elections. Italian government bond yields fell to their lowest since January and Portugal's to nine-month lows , while French bonds closed the gap on Germany.  Macron doing well in the first round of the French parliamentary elections bodes well for him getting a majority,  said Lyn Graham-Taylor, fixed income strategist at Rabobank.  The fact that 5-Star did poorly in local elections in Italy also suggests a setback for populism in Europe.  The euro rose back to $1.1220 in the currency markets, where anticipation is building ahead of Wednesday's conclusion of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting at which the central bank is expected to nudge up U.S. interest rates. But economists will be watching to see whether the recent dip in economic data and uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump has dented confidence. Britain's sterling was in focus again as it slipped back below $1.27 and 88.30 pence per euro as Prime Minister Theresa May attempted to prop up her position after last week's damaging election. A survey from one of the UK's biggest business groups showed confidence had been hit hard by the uncertainty left by the election ahead of the start of Brexit negotiations with the EU next week. May's plans for leaving the bloc had not changed, her spokesman said on Monday.  It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders,  said Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors.  The consequences could â if not addressed immediately â be disastrous for the UK economy.  Feds Up The G10 economic surprise index, covering the world's 10 leading economies, has dipped below zero for the first time in 8 months. JPMorgan, said the  reduced upside risk to growth and inflation  had led it to underweight growth-sensitive stocks and assets in favour of high-income plays. It is also feeding into dollar weakness. The greenback was a shade lower at 110.040 yen and the dollar index against a basket of currencies nudged down to 97.118, easing back from a nine-day high hit at the end of last week. In commodities, crude oil prices extended gains after rising on Friday when a pipeline leak in major producer Nigeria overpowered supply worries weighing on the market. U.S. crude and Brent were both more than 1 percent higher at $46.41 and $48.80 a barrel respectively, copper was steady while gold snapped a three-day losing streak to climb to $1,269 an ounce.

Egypt's improved security after years of turmoil and an Islamist militancy has helped revive German tourism, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries told a joint news conference with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Berlin.  Security alone does not promote a vibrant and flourishing society,  Zypries said.  We believe that stability and growth must be connected with an open society, with open dialogue, with the rule of law and religious pluralism.  Political instability and widespread violence in the years after the toppling of former president Hosni Mubarak in 2011 left Egypt's economy in tatters. Under President Sisi, the former head of Egypt's military, the economy has slowly recovered and security has improved, but the country is still fighting an Islamist insurgency that has previously targeted major tourist sites, hurting a vital sector. Sisi did not respond to her comments directly but said Egypt was keen to encourage investment from Germany's automotive parts, engineering and renewable energy sectors. They were speaking before the fourth annual meeting of the German-Egyptian Joint Economic Commission. Zypries said Germany was keen to work with Egypt on areas such as renewable energy and energy efficiency, and had offered export and investment guarantees to pave the way for more business deals. Annual trade between the two countries is worth 5.5 billion euros and the exports are likely to grow given Europe's positive economic outlook, Zypries said. The head of the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry told the commission that German exports to Egypt were up 50 percent in the first quarter from a year ago. Egyptian exports to Germany were up 32 percent, Eric Schweitzer said. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/germany-egypt-idUSL1N1J907O"},

At the same time we have affirmed the Long-Term IDRs of BDB, Expressbank and Sogelease at 'BBB-', 'BBB+' and 'BBB+', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed the Long-Term IDR of Allianz Bank Bulgaria (ABB) at 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. The rating actions follow Fitch's revision of Bulgarian sovereign Outlook to Positive from Stable on 2 June 2017 (see 'Fitch Revises Bulgaria's Outlook to Positive; Affirms IDR at 'BBB-' at www.fitchratings.com). KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS The Outlook on BDB was revised to Positive from Stable because BDB's IDRs are equalised with those of the Bulgarian sovereign. The affirmation of BDB's Long-Term IDR reflects Fitch's continued belief of a high probability of support from the Bulgarian sovereign, in case of need. The state's strong incentive to support BDB is mainly driven by the almost 100% ownership of the bank by and significant funding from (or guaranteed by) the state. Our view also takes into consideration the bank's role in supporting the government's economic policy. Potential support for BDB would be easily manageable for the state due to the bank's small size (total assets equal to 2% of Bulgarian GDP end-1Q17) and the sovereign's sound public finances. More information about the support rationale is available in the recent rating action commentary 'Fitch Affirms Bulgarian Development Bank at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable', dated 21 February 2017, at www.fitchratings.com. The Outlook revision to Positive from Stable on Expressbank and its subsidiary Sogelease is driven by the sovereign rating action. Expressbank is owned by Societe Generale (SG, A/Stable, 99.7% stake) and would have been rated one notch below the parent's were it not for the constraint from Bulgaria's Country Ceiling of 'BBB+'. The affirmation of Expressbank's and Sogelease's IDRs reflects Fitch's opinion of a high probability that they would be supported, if required, by their respective parents. Expressbank is based in the strategically important central and eastern European (CEE) region for Societe Generale and its synergies with SG are strong. In our assessment of support we also take into consideration significant funding from SG, Expressbank's long and successful track record in supporting SG's objectives (which is likely to continue), almost full ownership by the French parent and a high level of management and operational integration. The potential cost of support would be easily manageable for SG given Expressbank's small size. Sogelease is 100% owned by Expressbank and its IDRs are equalised with those of Expressbank because the leasing company is the bank's core subsidiary. Sogelease is an integral part of financial services provided by SG in Bulgaria and is strongly integrated into the parent group at both operational and funding levels. The affirmation of ABB's support-driven IDRs reflects Fitch's opinion of a high probability that it would be supported, if required, by Allianz SE (AA-/Stable), the bank's ultimate majority shareholder. Our opinion takes into consideration Allianz's strong credit risk profile and ABB's relative small size. However, Fitch believes that ABB has limited strategic importance to Allianz. Consequently, ABB's Long-Term IDR is four notches below that of Allianz. This is based on the strategic focus of Allianz on the insurance business, with ABB being its only banking subsidiary in CEE, and ABB's marginal contribution to the parent group's profits. In our view, Allianz's commitment to ABB depends on the subsidiary's contribution to Allianz's insurance and asset management business and financial self-sustainability. ABB's Stable Outlook mirrors that on the parent's Long-Term IDR. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS An upgrade of BDB will depend on a sovereign upgrade and on Fitch's assessment of the state's incentive to support the bank based on BDB's i) legal status; ii) liability structure, iii) role in carrying out government policies in the economy, and iv) the state's flexibility to support the bank in compliance with local resolution legislation and EU state-aid rules. The bank would be downgraded in case of a significant increase of funding not sourced from or guaranteed by the state, material erosion of the bank's capital surplus over regulatory minimums, or a substantial expansion in commercial lending (not our base case). A downgrade of the sovereign rating would trigger the same action on the IDR of BDB. The Long-Term IDRs of Expressbank and Sogelease would be upgraded if Bulgaria's Country Ceiling is revised upwards. The entities could be downgraded if Fitch believes that their strategic importance to their parents has weakened, which we view as unlikely. ABB is unlikely to be upgraded in case of an upward revision of the Country Ceiling, because of its limited strategic importance to Allianz. A downgrade of Allianz could lead to a downgrade of ABB. The rating actions are as follows: ABB Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F2' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Viability Rating of 'bb-' unaffected BDB Long-term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Revised to Positive from Stable Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F3' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BBB-' Expressbank Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F2' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Viability Rating of 'bb' unaffected Sogelease Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F2' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Contact: Primary Analyst Michal Bryks, ACCA Director +48 22 338 6293 Fitch Polska SA Krolewska 16, 00-103 Warsaw Secondary Analysts Agata Gryglewicz (ABB, Expressbank) Associate Director +48 22 330 6970 Jakub Kopiec, CFA (BDB, Sogelease) Analyst +48 22 330 6702 Committee Chairperson James Watson Managing Director +7 495 956 6657 Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

Terry Gou, Foxconn's founder and chief executive, said U.S.-based Kingston Technology Co, a maker of memory products, would also be part of the bidding group, while Amazon.com Inc was close to joining. The Taiwanese firm is also in discussions with Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems Inc about their participation in the bid, he said. He declined to say how much Apple and other U.S. firms planned to invest.  I can tell you Apple is in for sure,  Gou said in an interview, adding that its participation had been approved by Chief Executive Tim Cook and Apple's board of directors. Asked about the total size of the Foxconn-led offer, he declined to give a figure, saying only that it was  very close  to other bids. Toshiba is rushing to find a buyer for the world's second-largest producer of NAND chips, which it values at $18 billion or more, to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp. Foxconn, however, has not been seen as a frontrunner for the unit due to its deep ties with China, where it manufactures much of its products. The Japanese government has said it will block any deal that would risk the transfer of key chip technology out of the country. Gou said that the Foxconn-led consortium contained no Chinese capital and had the advantage of not inviting as much antitrust scrutiny as other suitors. He also played down potential opposition from the Japanese government to the bid.  The key is that we are all customers, we are users,  he said. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, and its Japanese unit Sharp Corp would have a combined stake of not more than 40 percent, he added. Representatives for Apple and the other U.S. firms named by Gou could not be immediately reached for comment outside of regular business hours. Sharp declined to comment. Terry Gou, founder and chairman of Foxconn reacts during an interview with Reuters in New Taipei City, Taiwan June 12, 2017.Eason LamSeparately a source familiar with the matter said Japanese telecoms and internet giant SoftBank Group Corp was also part of the Foxconn-led consortium. SoftBank declined to comment. Toshiba was not immediately available for comment. Fierce Competition Gou's revelations of the Foxconn-led bid come as uncertainty spikes over the make-up of the groups competing in the hotly contest auction just days before Toshiba is due to announce a preferred bidder. Slideshow (3 Images)Western Digital Corp plans to raise its offer for Toshiba's semiconductor unit, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters over the weekend, in a last-ditch effort to clinch a deal. The U.S. chipmaker is part of a consortium led by a Japanese government-backed fund and the group will present the new offer of 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) or more, the source said. The news helped Toshiba's shares climb 9 percent on Monday. The stock is still down 26 percent from levels in late December, before it flagged big losses at its Westinghouse unit. The laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate aims to name a winner  at a board meeting on June 15. Tokyo, however, has been asking Toshiba to postpone the decision as the government-led consortium has yet to finalize its proposal. Some sources have said that the state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan, is also exploring a potential consortium with Bain Capital, though it is unclear what other firms would also be members of that group.  Western Digital has been seen by some sources as crucial to a successful deal, as it jointly operates a key flash-memory chip plant with Toshiba in western Japan.  But Western Digital and Toshiba have been at loggerheads over the auction. Western Digital is pursuing an international arbitration claim that Toshiba has breached joint-venture contracts by entertaining outside bids. Toshiba has favored a separate bid from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake to offer 2.2 trillion yen, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.

So long as uncertainty is there I don't see that as particularly positive for M&A; in the short term,  Karen Cook, chair of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, said at the Reuters Global M&A; summit.   I think the problem is there is a government with different views amongst the Tory (Conservative) party, who are not all aligned to hard Brexit.   A failed gamble on a snap election has weakened Britain's hand just days before formal talks on leaving the European Union. It has also emboldened those within May's own Conservative ranks and beyond who object to her plan to leave the European single market and customs union. Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A; at JPMorgan, said that dealmaking would likely be driven by what happens in the currency markets.  What I follow more than hard or soft Brexit is what happens to sterling and post-election there is renewed weakness in sterling,  said Cristerna, noting a weaker pound could spark deals as happened after last year's Brexit vote.    There is an opportunistic situation when companies happen to be valued in sterling but most of their assets are global.  History Lessons  Going by past elections, dealmaking should in theory rise.  More M&A; deals involving a UK target company were announced immediately after the last two elections than immediately before, Thomson Reuters data shows.Â  In 2015, when the Conservatives won a small majority, four  percent more deals were announced during the 90 day period after the election than in the same period before. In 2010, when the election spawned a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, there was an eight percent increase.  An increase in the number of UK Outbound M&A; deals was also seen after the last three UK general elections, with an increase of 47 percent in 2015.  It's far too early to call what the consequences of last week are. The UK has had a relatively open environment for M&A;,  said William Rucker, Chief Executive of Lazard UK.   It's certainly more protectionist compared with 12 months ago but a lot of these things haven't been tested yet.  May had promised to make it harder for foreign firms to take over British ones, when she set out pre-election plans to give the state more influence over corporate Britain. To protect jobs, May said her government would tighten the rules around takeovers, especially in infrastructure deals where a foreign owner could also raise security concerns. However, the Conservatives will need the help of the small Democratic Unionist Party to govern, meaning parts of their manifesto may have to be dropped or modified.  There clearly is increased protectionism in the UK and the US,  said Cook.  If this government wants to have more protectionism they ought to do it through legislation not through the back door on takeover rules because I think the takeover rules broadly work.   The Takeover Panel administers Britain's code on takeovers and regulates deals to ensure fair treatment for investors. Special Relationship Despite political upheaval around the world, with the new U.S. administration under President Donald Trump also promoting an America-first agenda, dealmaking has remained robust.  Worldwide M&A; is up 3 percent so far this year to total $1.4 trillion, compared to the same period in 2016, Thomson Reuters data shows.  European M&A; is up 44 percent this year to total $393 billion, whilst M&A; in the United States is down 14 percent to total $499 billion, compared to the same period a year ago.  M&A; in Britain is up 89 percent year-to-date, totaling $81 billion, compared to this time last year.   U.S. companies are still very interested in Europe and European companies in the U.S.,   said Steve Baronoff, chairman of global M&A; at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.  The special relationship between the UK and the U.S. - that special relationship comes from the bottom up....It may ebb and flow a bit depending on who is running the country but that is the bedrock and that doesn't get changed depending on the president.

The new service, Tmall World, will allow overseas Chinese users to buy goods from Alibaba's Tmall brand-to-consumer retail site, the company said in a statement.   Alibaba will provide end-to-end solutions including logistics, payment, and localization support catering to each local market's needs,  the statement said. The firm plans on extending the Tmall World network to other countries in the future.     Alibaba has invested heavily in Southeast Asia, seeking to meet lofty user acquisition goals as the Chinese retail market shows signs of maturing.      Alibaba chairman Jack Ma told investors on Friday the company is aiming to have 2 billion customers within 15 years, with overseas customers accounting for 1.2 billion of those users.  Alibaba had roughly 450 million active annual buyers on its China marketplaces in the year ended March 31.      In 2016 it agreed to invest $1 billion in Southeast Asian retailer Lazada Group, and launching a service that allows local users to purchase a selection of Tmall goods.     The latest sales channels take aim at the 100 million Chinese citizens living overseas, and users must have an active Chinese payment method to purchase goods.      It comes as Alibaba payment affiliate Ant Financial is also expanding heavily in the region through investments and joint ventures.      In the past year the finance firm has sealed deals in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Hong Kong and India, as well as rebranding Lazada Group's payment arm Hello Pay under Ant Financial's own Alipay brand.     It also comes as rival Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com Inc (JD.O) is expanding operations in Southeast Asia.

The San Francisco-based lender hired Mayo to make calls on large-cap bank stocks in its securities business, according to a statement released on Monday.  Mike's stature in the industry is well-recognized,  Diane Schumaker-Krieg, global head of research, economics and strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, said in a statement.  We are thrilled to have such an influential voice in this critical sector join our growing platform.  Big banks had been covered at Wells Fargo by longtime analyst Matthew Burnell. It was not immediately clear whether he had left the firm. Mayo has garnered a reputation as a blunt critic of bad behavior in the industry who spots trouble early. Since the early 1990s, he has made several savvy calls on stocks before banks - individually or as a sector - faced huge losses. His more famous downgrades happened ahead of the dot-com bubble bursting near the turn of the century, as well as the more recent subprime mortgage crisis. Mayo has a tendency to ask pointed questions during conference calls and investor events, making himself a thorn in the side of top executives at Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, among others. He turned up at JPMorgan's most recent investor day less than 24 hours after losing his job at brokerage CLSA, identifying himself as a  free agent.  He then asked Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon what Mayo called a  trick question  about the bank's brand. Dimon responded by telling an anecdote about Mayo having been banned from participating in analyst calls at another bank because management found him to be  insulting.  But, Dimon said, the problems Mayo highlighted were correct, and his criticism ultimately helped the bank improve.  You are a brand, too, Mike Mayo,  said Dimon.  You didn't need CLSA.  Wells Fargo itself is in the midst of an overhaul after revelations emerged last year that thousands of employees had opened as many as 2.1 million accounts in customers' names without their permission to hit aggressive sales targets. The sales abuses led to a $185 million fine, a CEO departure and weakness in its share price. As an analyst working at Wells Fargo, Mayo will no longer be covering the bank.

Qatari Finance Minister Ali Sherif al-Emadi told CNBC that Doha could easily defend its currency and prevent shortages of food or other goods. Also, many investors still hope for a diplomatic solution in coming weeks. The Qatari stock index rose 0.8 percent after it fell 1.9 percent on Sunday; it is still down 8 percent since last Monday, when Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states cut diplomatic and trade ties with Doha. Foreign funds remained net sellers of Qatari shares on Monday but the pace of their selling slowed, bourse data showed, suggesting some funds were willing to accept higher political risk now that valuations were lower. Telecommunications operator Ooredoo rose 2.1 percent to 92.90 riyals, an 18 percent discount to the average fair value estimated by 11 analysts surveyed by Reuters. Non-Qatari Gulf funds have also slowed their pace of selling; on Monday they made up roughly 5 percent of total market turnover, in line with pre-crisis levels, bourse data showed. Dubai's Drake & Scull climbed 2.4 percent; it has now risen 8.0 percent in unusually large volumes since Thursday. Former chief executive Khaldoun Tabari has sold his stake in the company to Tabarak Investment, a source told Zawya, a Thomson Reuters publication. Tabarak Investment's stake stands at around 18 to 20 percent after the sale, making it the largest shareholder, Zawya said. In April, DSI said it would sell 500 million dirhams ($136 million) of shares to Tabarak as part of its capital restructuring programme, subject to regulatory approval. A 3.0 percent gain in shares of the largest listed real estate developer, Emaar Properties, to 7.83 dirhams also helped to carry Dubai's index 1.2 percent higher. The stock has been strong since last week when Emaar said it planned to distribute funds from a listing of its local real estate developer to shareholders. A second straight close above technical resistance at its December peak of 7.79 dirhams would confirm a break and target resistance at the April 2015 high of 8.39 dirhams. In Abu Dhabi, its largest listed developer Aldar Properties was also strong, gaining 4.4 percent to its highest closing price since late March. Dana Gas finished flat; the gas explorer has soared 48 percent this month on news that it received a portion of its overdue payments from Egypt and on hopes for its legal efforts to recover money from Iraqi Kurdistan. The Abu Dhabi index added 0.3 percent. Saudi, Egypt In Saudi Arabia, the index rose 0.2 percent as Brent oil prices recovered some of last week's heavy losses; eight of 14 listed petrochemical makers rose with Saudi Basic Industries up 0.5 percent.

Founded in 1889, Lanvin is one of France's last major independent fashion labels in an industry dominated by multi-brand groups such as LVMH and Kering. It has been in turmoil since the shock sacking in 2015 of star designer Alber Elbaz after a boardroom dispute. Elbaz was widely credited with infusing new life into the brand and being its driving force. Designer Bouchra Jarrar, appointed in March 2016, has brought a more strict, tailored style that is very different from Elbaz's often ultra-feminine silhouettes, and the new approach has so far failed to lift sales, the sources said.  The first collection went very badly, the second did not do better,  one said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the company has not published figures. Another source with access to the company's results said sales fell 23 percent last year to 162 million euros ($182 million). At their peak in 2012, they were 235 million euros. Sales slumped a further 32 percent in the first two months of 2017, the source added, in contrast to strong performances at luxury rivals such as LVMH's Louis Vuitton and Kering's Gucci. As a result, Lanvin fell into net loss of 18.3 million euros last year, its first in nearly a decade, from a profit of 6.3 million in 2015. The loss is seen widening to 27 million euros in 2017, the source said. Lanvin and Jarrar did not respond to requests for comment. The company, which currently has nearly 300 staff in France, has appointed advisory firm Long Term Partners to conduct an audit and has been cutting costs as a result, closing several non-profitable stores, the sources said. The programme will reduce advertising spending and store investments, and a plan to lay off nine people is under way too, with more cuts in the pipeline for 2017, they added. But some employees are leaving and the company faces a challenge to retain talent, the sources said. Management wants to create a leather goods line for fashion outlets, but some industry specialists said using what are often cheaper, discount stores could damage Lanvin's luxury image.  A jewel of the French fashion industry is under threat and staff are running out of patience,  one of the sources said. Controlling shareholder, 75-year-old Chinese media magnate Shaw-Lan Wang who is based in Taiwan, has been reluctant to invest in the brand for many years. She would not let her associate Swiss investor Ralph Bartel, who owns 25 percent of Lanvin, inject more cash into the business to support the brand as it would dilute her stake, sources have said.  He disagrees with the options chosen by the management and wants an urgent change in strategy,  one source said of Bartel. Wang and Bartel could not be reached for comment. $1 = 0.8910 euros Reporting by Pscale Denis; Writing by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Mark Potter ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/lanvin-outlook-idUSL9N0T103C"},

Asset managers cut their combined net long position in the three main futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 39 million barrels in the week ending June 6 (tmsnrt.rs/2ske0ve). The net position had been increased by a total of 114 million barrels over the previous three weeks, analysis of data published by regulators and exchanges showed (tmsnrt.rs/2rRLXld). The earlier increase, however, was driven mostly by covering of short positions rather than the creation of new longs, and the short-covering now seems to have run its course. Hedge funds added 24 million barrels of new short positions in the most recent week, all in Brent, where shorts rose by 33 million barrels. The ratio of long to short positions fell to only 3.1 to 1, well short of the recent peak of 5.8 on April 18, let alone the record 10.3 set in February (tmsnrt.rs/2rRVQiS). From a positioning perspective, the balance of risks is now on the upside, with few long positions left to be liquidated and a relatively large number of short positions that need to be covered. Brent prices are trading close to their lowest since OPEC announced it was cutting output on Nov. 30, which also suggests some potential for a bounce in the short term. Saudi Arabia has offered some rhetorical support by reiterating its determination to bring global oil stocks down to the five-year average, though policymakers have so far resisted pressure to cut output again. But the continued rise in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has made it hard for fund managers to become bullish again. The number of rigs targeting oil-bearing formations has more than doubled over the past 12 months, even though WTI prices are down by about 6 percent. The rig count has continued to climb  even after WTI prices peaked in February and started to decline (tmsnrt.rs/2rmxAli). Since production lags the rig count by six months, the recent increase in drilling will ensure that U.S. output continues rising for the remainder of 2017 and into 2018. The U.S. Energy Information Administration now forecasts output will increase by 460,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, up from the 110,000 bpd rise forecast in January. The agency expects production to rise by a further 680,000 bpd in 2018, against the 300,000 bpd forecast in January. With so much extra production projected to come from the United States, with output also increasing from Brazil, Norway, Libya and Nigeria, sentiment among hedge fund managers remains tepid. Fund managers have established large net long positions in crude twice this year, only for prices to drop sharply, leaving them with heavy losses. Many want firmer evidence that the market really is rebalancing before taking on risk again and going long for a third time.

The Swedish crew skippered by Australian sailing star Nathan Outteridge and managed by British Olympian Iain Percy must win three races in a row to overhaul Peter Burling's New Zealand and clinch the right to challenge defenders Oracle Team USA.  We have come back from worse before,  Percy told BT Sports in a televised interview after going 4-2 down on Sunday in their first-to-five series with New Zealand. Widely seen as the crew showing the best form in practice in the lead up to the 35th America's Cup, Artemis overcame a bigger deficit against SoftBank Team Japan last week to earn a place in the challenger play-off final against New Zealand. Â Â Â Â Their 50-foot (15-metre) catamaran 'Big Blue' has shown it is capable of beating all comers on Bermuda's Great Sound, claiming notable wins against Oracle Team USA during qualifying. While Outteridge has managed to get the team off to some stunning sling-shot starts, the team have struggled with consistency. They lost one race against New Zealand on Saturday when Outteridge, darting from one side of his boat to the other during a high-speed maneuver, skidded and plunged overboard.  The Olympic gold medalist in the demanding 49er skiff class was plucked from the water but not before coming within a boat's length of being run down by the New Zealand  cat . Olympic Medals Outteridge, 31, and Burling, 26, know each other's strengths and weaknesses well but they are more accustomed to head-to-head battles in relatively tiny two-man 49er skiffs than in the giant America's Cup Class boats. While Outteridge won Olympic gold in 2012, Burling got his revenge in 2016 in Rio, relegating his rival to silver. Both men are now sailing with their 49er partners in the America's Cup competition, with Burling's crew Blair Tuke joining him in the New Zealand boat and Outteridge's team mate Iain Jensen aboard the Artemis catamaran as a  grinder . If Artemis do manage to turn the tide against New Zealand on Monday when racing is scheduled to start at just after 1700 GMT, they will open the possibility to Sweden becoming only the fifth country to win the  Auld Mug . So far only the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland have won it since the schooner  America  first claimed the coveted trophy in British waters in 1851. Artemis was founded in 2006 by Swedish oil trading magnate and sailor Torbjorn Tornqvist, co-founder of the world's largest independent commodities trading house Gunvor, and is one of the best financed of the America's Cup challengers.

Police said Abedi, a 22-year-old born in Britain to parents of Libyan birth, travelled to Libya on April 15 and returned on May 18, four days before he targeted the Ariana Grande show in Manchester. Closed-circuit television footage showed him purchasing items for the bomb soon after he returned to Britain, including nuts from a hardware store that were used as shrapnel as well as the tin that was believed to contain the explosives, police said. Detectives said they believed materials used for making the bomb were stored in a white Micra car that Abedi purchased on April 15, shortly before he flew to Libya.  The actual assembly of all the parts appears to have been in the days immediately before the attack,  Russ Jackson, head of North West Counter Terrorism Policing, said in a statement.  Our enquiries show that the assembly of the device is likely to have been by Abedi himself.  Police said they still needed to establish whether Abedi acted alone in obtaining and storing all of the materials, and whether others were aware of his plan. Abedi's brother Hashem left Britain at about the same time and was arrested along with the men's father Ramadan by Libyan counter-terrorism investigators after the attack. A spokesman for Tripoli's Special Deterrence Force told Reuters last week that Hashem Abedi had told them his brother was radicalised in Britain in 2015 and that he had bought the materials for Salman.  Hashem Abedi is currently detained in Libya. There is much media reporting about what he has said in Libya and we wish to interview him in relation to this attack,  Jackson said.

Kenya's banking industry is undergoing consolidation after the closure of three lenders last year exposed weaknesses caused by lapses in corporate governance. The government also capped commercial lending rates and set a minimum interest rate last September, further squeezing banks' margins and putting pressure on lenders to consolidate. NBK, in which the government and the state pension fund NSSF have a combined 70 percent stake, has been particularly hard hit, sliding into the red and falling below statutory minimum capital requirements. Both banks have the government and the NSSF as their largest shareholders and they have traditionally competed for public sector banking business, including deposits. KCB is casting the takeover offer as a solution to the crisis at NBK, which has eroded shareholder value of what was previously one of Kenya's biggest banks, the documents showed. If the deal goes ahead, the combined bank will have assets of 750 billion shillings ($7.3 billion), with the capacity to grow to 1 trillion shillings within three years, the documents seen by Reuters on the proposal showed. The value of the deal will be based on the market valuation of NBK. Analysts said it was hard to gauge the eventual price since NBK has some preference shares, which would have to be converted into ordinary equity at an agreed rate. KCB's Chief Executive Joshua Oigara confirmed in an email response to Reuters on Monday that the bank had sent an expression of interest in acquiring a controlling state in NBK to the finance ministry. He did not offer more details. NBK's shares, which hit a 14-year low of 5 shillings ($0.0484) in March, jumped as much as 10 percent on Monday to 7.7 shillings on news of the takeover bid. Francis Mwangi, a banking analyst at Standard Investment Bank, said the deterioration of NBK's financial performance had made it an attractive acquisition target.  It always makes sense to acquire a company that is struggling because of assets that can be turned around. That's how you unlock value in a short period of time,  Mwangi said. KCB is open to other takeover scenarios than its proposed share swap, the documents showed. In its proposal, KCB, which also operates in neighbouring countries, said it would initially take over 70 percent of NBK shares, before announcing its offer for the remaining stake. Other deals announced in Kenya's banking sector in recent months include the purchase of tiny lender Fidelity by the State Bank of Mauritius, and the acquisition of Habib Bank Kenya by Diamond Trust Bank in a share swap.

The release of a report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs coincides with the first anniversary of the massacre at Orlando's Pulse nightclub, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Excluding Pulse victims, 28 Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender were killed in 2016, which was up 17 percent from 24 killed the previous year, according to the annual report. The number of killings last year was the highest since 2012, when 25 LGBT people were killed. Including Pulse victims, murders of LGBT people rose 217 percent in 2016. Not all of those killed in the nightclub attack were LGBT.   The enormous tragedy at Pulse Nightclub, in concert with the daily violence and discrimination that pervades our lives as LGBTQ people ... have created a perfect storm of fear and trauma for our communities this year,â Melissa Brown at the Kansas City Anti-Violence Project, a member of the coalition, said in a statement. The  Q  in  LGBTQ  refers  queer,  a term that avoids specifying sexual orientation or gender identity.  The coalition, which has released the report since 1997, said LGBT people remain vulnerable to violence in 2017, especially in what it described as the current  incendiary political climate.  âRecent executive orders as well as ongoing efforts to pass anti-LGBTQ legislation and roll back protections at the city, state, and federal level make LGBTQ people vulnerable to identity-based discrimination,  Beverly Tillery, with the New York City Anti-Violence Project, said in a statement.  Of the 2016 killings not connected to Pulse nightclub, 79 percent of victims were black or Hispanic and 68 percent were transgender.  LGBT people of color and those with disabilities were more than twice as likely as whites and the able-bodied to be the victims of harassment and non-fatal forms of violence, the report said.  Most of the victims knew their attackers, who commonly included employers, neighbors, landlords and family members, it said.

Widely seen as the crew showing the best form in practice in the lead up to the 35th America's Cup, Artemis overcame a bigger deficit against SoftBank Team Japan last week to earn a place in the challenger play-off final against New Zealand. Â Â Â Â Their 50-foot (15-metre) catamaran 'Big Blue' has shown it is capable of beating all comers on Bermuda's Great Sound, claiming notable wins against Oracle Team USA during qualifying. While Outteridge has managed to get the team off to some stunning sling-shot starts, the team have struggled with consistency. They lost one race against New Zealand on Saturday when Outteridge, darting from one side of his boat to the other during a high-speed maneuver, skidded and plunged overboard.  The Olympic gold medalist in the demanding 49er skiff class was plucked from the water but not before coming within a boat's length of being run down by the New Zealand  cat . Olympic Medals Outteridge, 31, and Burling, 26, know each other's strengths and weaknesses well but they are more accustomed to head-to-head battles in relatively tiny two-man 49er skiffs than in the giant America's Cup Class boats. While Outteridge won Olympic gold in 2012, Burling got his revenge in 2016 in Rio, relegating his rival to silver. Both men are now sailing with their 49er partners in the America's Cup competition, with Burling's crew Blair Tuke joining him in the New Zealand boat and Outteridge's team mate Iain Jensen aboard the Artemis catamaran as a  grinder . If Artemis do manage to turn the tide against New Zealand on Monday when racing is scheduled to start at just after 1700 GMT, they will open the possibility to Sweden becoming only the fifth country to win the  Auld Mug . So far only the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland have won it since the schooner  America  first claimed the coveted trophy in British waters in 1851. Artemis was founded in 2006 by Swedish oil trading magnate and sailor Torbjorn Tornqvist, co-founder of the world's largest independent commodities trading house Gunvor, and is one of the best financed of the America's Cup challengers.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties a week ago, accusing Doha of backing terrorism. This has disrupted imports of food and other materials and caused many foreign banks to scale back business with Qatar. But on Monday, it was becoming clear that Qatar could prevent the economic damage from becoming critical. Some of its food factories are working extra shifts to process imports from nations outside the Gulf, such as Brazil, and shipping lines are operating via Oman instead of the UAE. These measures may be inconvenient, involve delays and raise costs for Qatar; on Monday Fitch put Qatar's AA credit rating on Rating Watch Negative, saying a sustained crisis could hurt its credit outlook. But they are unlikely to prevent the economy from functioning in any fundamental way. In the local money market, where Qatari banks have often depended on loans and deposits from foreign banks, local institutions made up liquidity shortfalls by borrowing from the central bank's repo facility, bankers said. In an interview with CNBC television, one of the first public appearances by a Qatari economic policy maker since the crisis erupted, Qatari finance minister Ali Sherif al-Emadi sounded confident. He said the energy sector and economy of the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter were essentially operating as normal and that there had not been a serious impact on supplies of food or other goods. Qatar can import goods from Turkey, the Far East or Europe and will respond to the crisis by diversifying its economy even more, he told CNBC.  Our reserves and investment funds are more than 250 percent of gross domestic product, so I don't think there is any reason that people need to be concerned about what's happening or any speculation on the Qatari riyal.  In a statement, central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani ruled out imposing capital controls, saying authorities were committed to free cross-border flows of money, and said Qatari banks could use overseas offices in Asia and Europe to conduct transactions if needed. In the Gulf's tense political climate, many independent analysts in the region decline to discuss Qatar's economy publicly for fear of irritating their governments. But Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at London-based Capital Economics, said that as long as the other Gulf countries did not interfere with Qatar's LNG exports, which would be a major escalation of the crisis, the tiny state would probably be able to carry on without a serious recession.  It seems Qatar would be able to weather quite a prolonged period of sanctions,  he said, adding that economic growth, fuelled by government spending and infrastructure projects, was  highly unlikely to grind to halt . Markets Qatar's riyal currency, pegged at 3.64 to the U.S. dollar, was under pressure last week as banks reacted nervously to the diplomatic rift. On Monday, the currency came off last week's lows in the spot and offshore forwards markets. Bankers said the central bank, which has $34.5 billion of net foreign reserves, backed by an estimated hundreds of billions of dollars of assets in Doha's sovereign wealth fund, was supplying enough dollars to the spot market to keep exchange rates under control. The cost of insuring Qatar's sovereign debt against default fell back for the first time in a week, while yields on Doha's international bonds dropped almost 10 basis points and the stock market stabilised after sliding 8.7 percent in the past week. One result of the sanctions has been a severe shortage of U.S. dollar cash at Qatar's money changers; supplies used to be flown in from the UAE but that route is closed. The shortage persisted on Monday although some dealers said efforts were underway to obtain supplies from elsewhere, such as Hong Kong. Tuvey said the main threat to the economy was that Qatari banks could find it much harder to obtain wholesale funding from other banks to sustain growth in their loan portfolios. This could force them to call in loans, hurting the economy. However, if the situation becomes critical, the Qatari government can liquidate some of its overseas assets and provide the funds to its banking system, much as Saudi Arabia did last year when its banks faced a funding squeeze due to low oil prices, he said. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund has major stakes in top Western companies such as Credit Suisse. Asked by CNBC whether it might now sell some of these stakes to raise money, Emadi indicated this was not on the cards at present.  We are extremely comfortable with our positions, our investments and liquidity in our systems,  he said. A Qatari commercial banker told Reuters on Monday that local banks were evaluating the risks if the crisis continued, but they remained able to operate:  Thereâs less panic now but also thereâs no complacency.â He said his own bank had borrowed over $100 million in unsecured three-year term financing from an international bank in the last day or so. It had been in talks for the loan for two or three weeks and the lender was willing to provide funds because it didn't see a credit risk and wanted to preserve its business relationship, he said.

Duterte told a news conference in Cagayan de Oro City, about 100 km (62 miles) from the besieged town of Marawi, that he had  never approached America  for help. When asked about U.S. support to fight the pro-Islamic State militants in Marawi City on the island of Mindanao, Duterte said he was  not aware of that until they arrived.   The cooperation between the longtime allies in the battle is significant because Duterte, who came to power a year ago, has taken a hostile stance towards Washington and has vowed to eject U.S. military trainers and advisers from his country.  It is unclear whether the pro-American military went over Duterte's head in seeking U.S. help.  The Philippines military said on Saturday U.S. forces were providing technical assistance but had no  boots on the ground , confirming a statement from the U.S. embassy in Manila which said the support had been requested by the government. [nL3N1J7054] The seizure of Marawi on May 23 by hundreds of local and foreign fighters has alarmed Southeast Asian nations, which fear the ultra-radical group Islamic State is trying to establish a stronghold on Mindanao that could threaten their region. The Pentagon, which has no permanent presence in the Philippines but for years has kept 50 to 100 special forces troops in the south of the country on rotational exercises, confirmed it was helping the Philippine military in Marawi. It said in a statement on Saturday it was providing Philippine forces with security assistance and training in the areas of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. It said it had an additional 300 to 500 troops in the country to support regular training and activities, without giving further details. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said support included aerial surveillance and targeting, electronic eavesdropping, communications assistance and training. A U.S. P-3 Orion surveillance plane was seen over the town on Friday.  Our Soldiers Are Pro-American  Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte (C) with Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana (L) and General Eduardo Ano, talks after visiting wounded soldiers who fight against the insurgents of the Maute group, which has taken over large parts of the Marawi city, at a military camp in Cagayan De Oro, Philippines June 11, 2017.Romeo RanocoDuterte, who declared martial law on Mindanao - an island the size of South Korea - after the Islamist fighters overran Marawi, said that under martial law he has authority over the defense department. He did not say the armed forces had gone over his head but noted that, because of years of training from the United States,  our soldiers are pro-American, that I cannot deny.  Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said in a statement U.S. forces were not participating directly in combat operations as it is prohibited by Philippines law. Slideshow (5 Images) The fight against terrorism, however, is not only the concern of the Philippines or the United States but it is a concern of many nations around the world,  he said.  The Philippines is open to assistance from other countries if they offer it.  As of Saturday the number of security forces killed in the battle for Marawi stood at 58. The death toll for civilians was 20 and more than 100 had been killed overall. At least 200 militants are holed up in a corner of the town. An estimated 500 to 1,000 civilians are trapped there, some being held as human shields, while others are hiding in their homes with no access to running water, electricity or food. One of the main Islamist factions dug in around the heart of the city is the Maute group, a relative newcomer amid the throng of insurgents, separatists and bandits on Mindanao. Maute joined forces with Isnilon Hapilon, who was last year proclaimed by Islamic State as its Southeast Asia  emir .      Military officials believe Hapilon is still in the town. The military has said it is aiming to end the siege by Monday, the Philippines' independence day.

The single room, similar to nine others on the dingy floor with no lift, was cramped and noisy, not a place she could invite friends to. The neighbourhood, Bhendi Bazaar in the heart of India's financial hub, was not one she could boast of, either. That is about to change as the 150-year-old quarter - a colloquial twist on  behind the bazaar  as it was known - embarks on a unique community-led modernisation that could be a model for inner-city redevelopment across India.  We have often felt embarrassed to say where we live; we have even heard of marriage proposals being rejected for people who live here,  said Nallwalla, 24, a PhD student.  But now I am very excited about this project. I am looking forward to having our own toilet, for my parents to finally have their own room, and being able to call people over,  she said. The Nallwallas are among 3,200 families and 1,250 businesses who populate bustling Bhendi Bazaar, with its narrow streets bursting with shops and vendors selling everything from hardware and yards of colourful cloth to antique furniture. The dilapidated low-rise buildings in the 16.5-acre (7 hectares) site will make way for high-rise towers, wide streets, parking lots and green spaces.  It is a shame the community has lived like this for so long,  said Abbas Master, chief executive of Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust that is funding and overseeing the project. Many residents belong to the tight-knit Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community, a Shi'ite sect, who have made the neighbourhood their own with mosques and restaurants serving familiar food. Their leader, the late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, spoke of improving the neighbourhood and making owners of tenants.  His Holiness was very disheartened by these conditions, but there were no policies then that could enable a redevelopment. Now that there are, we want to do our duty for the betterment of the community,  Master said. Migrant Workers The 250 brick and wood buildings crammed into Bhendi Bazaar were initially made for migrant workers who flocked to the busy port and textile mills in Bombay, as the city was then known. The area also drew traders in wood and textiles from the neighbouring state of Gujarat. Slowly, the workers brought their families over, but stayed put in the cheap, dormitory-style rooms measuring about 250 square feet (23 sq metre) with shared toilets. Through it all, the buildings became increasingly dilapidated as rents stayed low at 20-30 rupees (less than 50 cents) a month. Landlords refused to upgrade and tenants, with few affordable options in the city, added amenities such as air-conditioners while lining up outside the common toilets. A single tree breaks the jumble of buildings. It is a familiar story in many of India's congested cities, where thousands of colonial-era buildings fall under an archaic rent-control law. Many of these buildings, with their exposed wiring, sagging staircases and broken sewage pipes, have been declared unfit to live in. But tenants who have lived there for generations oppose any plans that might uproot them or raise rents. In Mumbai, which has some of the world's most expensive real estate, the situation is particularly dire: more than 60 percent of its 18 million people live in slums and informal settlements. New policies in recent years, including a state plan for  cluster development  of slums and tenement blocks, and a federal scheme to revitalise 500 cities including Mumbai, have provided more leeway for redevelopment.  It is very difficult to get all stakeholders to agree to a plan, so there are few success stories, and none of the scale of Bhendi Bazaar,  said Anuj Puri, chairman of real estate consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle Residential.  Redevelopment is a process of urban renewal. But it is also important that the cultural fabric of the community be preserved,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Arches, Domes The Saifee Trust intends to do that, said Master. The towers, with sweeping views of the city and of the Arabian Sea, will house shops on the ground floor and two additional floors. The rest will be given over to residences. Apartments will be 350 sq ft each, with a bedroom and two attached bathrooms, with a space even to hang the washing, but in an  aesthetic manner , Master said. All residents who have lived there or had shops before 1996 will get ownership titles. The towers will feature elements of Fatemi architecture, with arches, domes and jalis, or carved latticework. They will also have sewage plants, solar panels and rainwater harvesting. Eighty percent of the land will be used to house existing tenants, while a fifth will be sold to meet an estimated cost of 40 billion rupees ($620 million) in a project that is expected to take a decade to complete.  Bhendi Bazaar has a special place in the city, and it is our duty to conserve that character, our culture and sense of community,  Master said.  At the same time, we need to evolve. This could be a model for urban rejuvenation elsewhere in the country.  Fried Snack On a recent weekday evening in Bhendi Bazaar, the area was a cacophony of honking horns and vendors calling out their wares, as the call for prayer sounded from a mosque. Men in cream-coloured embroidered caps and women in the traditional rida - a two-piece dress with a headscarf and a long skirt - rushed about on foot and on motorbikes, buying fruit and fried dishes for the iftar meal to break their Ramadan fast. As the evening wore on, others flocked to the area to feast on delicacies unique to Bhendi Bazaar. For the Nallwallas, the celebratory mood has more meaning, even if they have to wait about five years for their new home.  I've been here more than 50 years - my parents lived here, then me, and now my children,  said Rashida, Robab's mother.  We could have never imagined we will one day own a nice home right here. I'm looking forward to that day.  $1 = 64.2724 Indian rupees Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran, Editing by Ros Russell.

As the president and CEO of Cohen Brothers Realty, the corporation started by his father and uncles, the 65-year-old billionaire has been involved in the construction and management of countless Manhattan addresses, from Grand Central Plaza at 622 Third Avenue to International Plaza at 750 Lexington. But Cohen's not-so-secret passion is the film business: Producing movies, collecting them and even screening them at Manhattan's Quad Cinema. For the latest in Reuters'  Life Lessons  series, he spoke about how to thrive in even the toughest business environments. Q: Since your father was the one who started your real estate business, was he your greatest influence? A: For my whole life. He was a self-made man: He began his career in men's clothing, and then became an Oldsmobile dealer after WW2, and then started in real estate. Whatever I learned from him was by observation and osmosis. He was very no-nonsense, and I notice that in my own personality quite a bit, too. He didn't sugar-coat anything. Q: Did you work for him when you were growing up? A: When I was 14 I used to work summers in his real estate office. I would type up lease renewals, and on weekends show apartments as well. It was a good way to discover my own voice in dealing with people. I was mature for my age, and I guess I was pretty good at it. Q: New York City real estate is a tough business. Do you have to be equally tough to survive? A: Construction is a tough business, for sure. There are tough characters, and people looking to take advantage of you every step of the way. You get experienced by surviving those situations and making the best of them. Does it make you a little hard? Well, if you are not tough, you'll be run over in the street with tire marks across your back. Q: What drew you to invest in film? A: Being a producer is very much like being a developer. In the real estate world you receive rent, just like you receive fees and royalties for intellectual property. Entertainment is a tough business, too, but very rewarding when you accomplish something meaningful. I have stayed independent, and I only do projects that resonate with me. Q: What principles have guided your philanthropic spending? A: It is based on personal feelings, and wanting to make a difference. So I'm involved with everything from the Museum of Arts and Design, to the Alliance Francaise, to the Temple of Emanu-El in Manhattan, which is the largest Jewish congregation in the world. It's not just about writing a check, though. I want to make a meaningful contribution. Q: Are you planning for your kids to get involved in the business at some point? A: I always encourage my kids to do what it is that they want to do. So right now, nobody works with me. It's important that they find what they really love, and then get very good at it. That process will take about 20 years, that is what I have found. Q: Did you set up trusts for them? A: Interestingly I had no trust growing up, and my father never gave me any money, either early on or later. But yes, I do have trusts for my children, which I control and invest for them. It is important that they be provided for. Q: What do you tell them about success? A: The only way to learn any business is to do absolutely everything, from the ground up. So I started out doing leases, and then got into different areas like management, finance, zoning, cleaning, acquisitions. Hopefully, you will get to the top over time. But you have to understand the business first. Editing by Beth Pinsker","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/money-lifelessons-cohen-idUSL1N1J612V"},

The coalition, which has released the report since 1997, said LGBT people remain vulnerable to violence in 2017, especially in what it described as the current  incendiary political climate.  âRecent executive orders as well as ongoing efforts to pass anti-LGBTQ legislation and roll back protections at the city, state, and federal level make LGBTQ people vulnerable to identity-based discrimination,  Beverly Tillery, with the New York City Anti-Violence Project, said in a statement.  Of the 2016 killings not connected to Pulse nightclub, 79 percent of victims were black or Hispanic and 68 percent were transgender.  LGBT people of color and those with disabilities were more than twice as likely as whites and the able-bodied to be the victims of harassment and non-fatal forms of violence, the report said.  Most of the victims knew their attackers, who commonly included employers, neighbors, landlords and family members, it said.

Technology stocks have been enjoying a record-setting rally, helped largely by a recent string of strong quarterly earnings. The S&P; 500 technology index has risen 18.5 percent this year and is on track to register its best yearly performance since 2014. However, the index tumbled 2.7 percent on Friday, sparked by a sharp drop in Apple shares amid reports that the company is using slower modems in upcoming iPhones, compared with its rivals. Shares of the world's most valuable publicly-listed company were off 2.34 percent to $145.59 in heavy premarket trading on Monday. Closely watched technology stocks, including those of Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet, were also in the red.  We're starting to question valuations of technology (stocks) at these levels and investors are trying to jockey their way around this thought process,  said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Wall Street's major indexes hit all-time highs on Friday, driven by banks and energy stocks but those gains were offset by the tech selloff later in the day. Dow e-minis were down 18 points, or 0.08 percent, at 8:26 a.m. ET (1226 GMT), with 13,576 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis were down 4 points, or 0.16 percent, with 143,151 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 51.25 points, or 0.89 percent, on volume of 34,454 contracts Investors are likely to be on the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting starting Tuesday, where traders see a 94 percent chance for an interest rate hike. Shares of General Electric rose 3 percent to $28.81 after the company said Jeff Immelt would retire as chief executive and would be replaced by John Flannery, the head of GE healthcare, ending a years-long succession plan. Shares of Apple suppliers, including Qualcomm, Skyworks Solutions and Micron Tech, were off between 0.6-2.12 percent. Coherus BioSciences tumbled 32.5 percent to $13.95 after the FDA denied the approval of its biosimilar for Amgen's Neulasta, which fights infections in cancer patients. Amgen was up marginally at $164.85. (Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-idUSL3N1J93PF"},

Yet his website Al-Bedaiah, a rare dissident voice in Egypt, had never been touched. On Sunday that changed when it suddenly went blank with no warning after being blocked, part of what Balshi called an unprecedented and far-reaching state crackdown on scores of news websites in recent weeks.   Let's be clear, the Egyptian websites going through this are dealing with a long-term shutdown -- this is not short term,  said Balshi from his downtown Cairo office, where four work stations sat idle, because staff feared coming to work in case of arrest. Balshi's website was the 57th blocked since May 24, according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression, a non-government organization tracking the affected sites through software that monitors outages. Journalists see the campaign against them as a step toward banning all but the most state-aligned media, effectively reversing the private media boom that flourished in the final decade of former president Hosni Mubarak's rule and which they say helped push him from power in 2011. Though no precise figures on readership are available, Egypt enjoys an active private media that includes widely read print and web format publications as well as popular late-night talk shows. State newspapers still maintain wide circulation. The spike in censorship has come as a surprise, even to journalists long-accustomed to reporting within strict red lines in Egypt where direct criticism of the military, the president, and judiciary are considered taboo and punishable by jail time. The government has offered no comment on the reason behind the blockages and the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology had no immediate comment. Muslim Brotherhood Makram Mohamed Ahmed, head of the newly formed Supreme Media Council, a state media regulator, told Reuters he believes  the main reason is how much [these websites] deal with the Muslim Brotherhood or express support for terrorism,  referring to the Islamist group whose president Mohamed Mursi held office for a year before being ousted in 2013 by the military after mass protests. FILE PHOTO: Masked Egyptian security forces walk by a demonstration held by journalists and activists against the detention of journalists, in front of the Press Syndicate in Cairo, Egypt April 26, 2016.Mohamed Abd El Ghany/File PhotoBut the blockages have also hit Mada Masr, a self-described progressive outlet with no Islamist ties, as well as the widely read Al-Borsa, a financial newspaper favored by the largely pro-government business community.  If they did something more grave like arresting team members or me it would make big noise, whereas blocking the website is the best way to paralyze us without paying a high price for it,  Lina Atallah, editor of Mada Masr, told Reuters.  Some journalists say a presidential election in 2018 means Egypt is doubling down on press restrictions, a move intended to ensure opposition candidates have few spaces to challenge general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is widely expected to run for a second term. Slideshow (3 Images) There are people getting ready to nominate themselves for the presidency and they have to make their voices heard or else they won't be competitive,  said Adel Sabry, the editor-in-chief of Masr al-Arabia, a website blocked last month.   [The goal] is that it's just one voice,  said editor-in-chief of Al-Borsa, Hussein Abd Rabo, who said his paper could be closed any day. Red Sea Islands When Balshi's website was wiped from Egyptian screens seven of its eight most read articles dealt with the same hot-button issue: a controversial accord transferring two Red Sea islands to Egypt's top benefactor, Saudi Arabia. The measure is expected to be voted on within days by parliament.  Like another website blocked on Sunday, El Badil, Balshi's has provided a platform for critics of the deal who argue that the islands are Egyptian territory, a point of view that sparked rare street protests last year calling for the accord's cancellation. Balshi and other journalists believe the wave of censorship is meant to neutralize debate on an issue that opposition figures say has already eroded some of Sisi's support among voters who consider ceding sovereign territory unacceptable.  I insist that we remain a voice, no matter what. And that we try to preserve our space. I think it should be done even as a suicide mission,  said Balshi.  What can we do?

Yet his website Al-Bedaiah, a rare dissident voice in Egypt, had never been touched. On Sunday that changed when it suddenly went blank with no warning after being blocked, part of what Balshi called an unprecedented and far-reaching state crackdown on scores of news websites in recent weeks.   Let's be clear, the Egyptian websites going through this are dealing with a long-term shutdown -- this is not short term,  said Balshi from his downtown Cairo office, where four work stations sat idle, because staff feared coming to work in case of arrest. Balshi's website was the 57th blocked since May 24, according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression, a non-government organization tracking the affected sites through software that monitors outages. Journalists see the campaign against them as a step toward banning all but the most state-aligned media, effectively reversing the private media boom that flourished in the final decade of former president Hosni Mubarak's rule and which they say helped push him from power in 2011. Though no precise figures on readership are available, Egypt enjoys an active private media that includes widely read print and web format publications as well as popular late-night talk shows. State newspapers still maintain wide circulation. The spike in censorship has come as a surprise, even to journalists long-accustomed to reporting within strict red lines in Egypt where direct criticism of the military, the president, and judiciary are considered taboo and punishable by jail time. The government has offered no comment on the reason behind the blockages and the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology had no immediate comment. Muslim Brotherhood Makram Mohamed Ahmed, head of the newly formed Supreme Media Council, a state media regulator, told Reuters he believes  the main reason is how much [these websites] deal with the Muslim Brotherhood or express support for terrorism,  referring to the Islamist group whose president Mohamed Mursi held office for a year before being ousted in 2013 by the military after mass protests. FILE PHOTO: Masked Egyptian security forces walk by a demonstration held by journalists and activists against the detention of journalists, in front of the Press Syndicate in Cairo, Egypt April 26, 2016.Mohamed Abd El Ghany/File PhotoBut the blockages have also hit Mada Masr, a self-described progressive outlet with no Islamist ties, as well as the widely read Al-Borsa, a financial newspaper favored by the largely pro-government business community.  If they did something more grave like arresting team members or me it would make big noise, whereas blocking the website is the best way to paralyze us without paying a high price for it,  Lina Atallah, editor of Mada Masr, told Reuters.  Some journalists say a presidential election in 2018 means Egypt is doubling down on press restrictions, a move intended to ensure opposition candidates have few spaces to challenge general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is widely expected to run for a second term. Slideshow (3 Images) There are people getting ready to nominate themselves for the presidency and they have to make their voices heard or else they won't be competitive,  said Adel Sabry, the editor-in-chief of Masr al-Arabia, a website blocked last month.   [The goal] is that it's just one voice,  said editor-in-chief of Al-Borsa, Hussein Abd Rabo, who said his paper could be closed any day. Red Sea Islands When Balshi's website was wiped from Egyptian screens seven of its eight most read articles dealt with the same hot-button issue: a controversial accord transferring two Red Sea islands to Egypt's top benefactor, Saudi Arabia. The measure is expected to be voted on within days by parliament.  Like another website blocked on Sunday, El Badil, Balshi's has provided a platform for critics of the deal who argue that the islands are Egyptian territory, a point of view that sparked rare street protests last year calling for the accord's cancellation. Balshi and other journalists believe the wave of censorship is meant to neutralize debate on an issue that opposition figures say has already eroded some of Sisi's support among voters who consider ceding sovereign territory unacceptable.  I insist that we remain a voice, no matter what. And that we try to preserve our space. I think it should be done even as a suicide mission,  said Balshi.  What can we do?

Prices on new flats in Prague have jumped almost 20 percent in the past year and Czech house price growth is among the fastest in the European Union, pushed up by limited supply and low interest rates. Economists have yet to say the market is in a bubble, but the central bank is seeking to expand its powers to allow it to set limits on how much banks can lend to home buyers rather than just making recommendations as at present. The government launched a bill in January that would allow the bank to cap loans according to debt-to-income (DTI), debt-servicing-to-income (DSTI) and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. Some lawmakers fear that might leave borrowers such as young families shut out of the housing market, however, and have added amendments limiting the law's scope. A final vote could come later this month. If the law fails it is likely to be delayed until after the October election. That would leave the central bank looking for other ways to tame house prices, such as reverting to individual bank-by-bank capital requirements or a countercyclical capital buffer set for all banks, currently at 0.5 percent.  If it does not pass, the (central) bank will use other instruments, like ordering banks to increase their reserves, and that would affect all loans,  Budget Committee deputy chairman Jaroslav Klaska, whose Christian Democrats are part of the governing coalition, told Reuters. The central bank is due to release its annual financial stability report on Tuesday. Board member Vojtech Benda told a Reuters Summit in May that property prices were over-valued by 10 percent on average. The bank needed the new tools, he said, but not necessarily to use immediately. Since April, the bank has recommended that mortgages should not exceed 90 percent of property values (LTV) and that no more than 15 percent of customers should be given loans worth more than 80 percent of a property's value. Stricter guidelines have tamed lending somewhat but housing prices continue rising, especially in Prague.  We already have cases of people who last year would go through (the mortgage process) without a problem but now there is no chance,  said Jiri Rajek, business development consultant with RE/MAX, one of the leading real estate companies.

Paulo newspaper said on Monday. Temer's main political advisory group backs the idea, which would reduce the highest income tax bracket to as low as 18 percent from 27.5 percent, Estado reported, without saying how it got the information. The plan has yet to be presented and discussed with Temer's economic policymakers, the paper said. The government would tax dividends in order to fund eventual revenue losses stemming from the income tax reduction, the report said. Those eligible for Brazil's top social assistance program Bolsa Familia would get a 4.5 percent hike in stipends - above annual inflation readings. An email seeking comment from the president's office was not immediately answered. The report adds to growing concerns that Temer may ease budget spending controls to assert himself in power after a recent plea deal by members of a billionaire family suggested he was involved in a corruption probe.

The Outlook is Stable. We have also assigned an expected rating of 'BB(EXP)' to its planned seven-year GBP200 million senior secured guaranteed bond.. The assignment of the final ratings is subject to receipt of final bank loan and bond documentation being substantially on the terms as presented to Fitch. Ocado's 'BB-' IDR reflects its favourable market position and competitive advantages as a pure-play online grocery retailer, despite its small scale and the strong competition in food markets in the UK. A lean cost base supports the group's profitability as reflected in solid EBITDAR and FFO margins. These are in line with the ratings, but are counterbalanced by a negative FCF margin, due to current and committed investments to support its distribution platform in 2017 and 2018. As a point of possible vulnerability we also note the strong reliance of its pricing competitiveness on a joint supply agreement with Waitrose (maturing in 2020), and profit dependence on the single distribution arrangements on behalf of Morrisons. The rating is underpinned by moderate leverage and our expectation of deleveraging capacity, as the business matures, along with strong financial flexibility for the rating. KEY RATING DRIVERS Positive Market Share Trend: The rating reflects Ocado's growing market share, especially against the  big four  UK food retailers, which are struggling to manage their multi-format legacy store base whilst running their online operations rather inefficiently. This helps to counterbalance the group's small scale, its narrow geographic diversification (most of UK now), and overall market share position. According to Kantar Worldpanel, Ocado has doubled its market share since end-2014 - helped by the lack of cannibalisation of other channels, and it now accounts for 1.3% of food retail sales as its revenue continues to grow in the low to mid-double digits. This is ahead of the overall online grocery market, which currently has a growth rate of 7.8%. We also estimate Ocado's market share in online grocery retail at around 15%. The calculation excludes Morrison's online operations which are run exclusively on Ocado's Smart Platform. This is an important support to the rating along with Ocado's well-diversified customer base across ages and household income levels. Strong Online Presence: Ocado's dedicated online presence reflected in its unique end-to-end operating solution for online grocery retail based on proprietary intellectual property and technology - and the lack of costs associated with running a brick-and-mortar store network - is a key differentiating factor from competitors. Moreover, the group's ability to offer products that are exclusively supplied via Ocado provides a solid product and service offering. This is  supported by more recent brand additions such as Fabled (in combination with Marie Claire), Fetch (pet store) and Sizzle (kitchen and dining) along with its exclusive supply partnership with Waitrose. Manageable Competition: We consider Ocado a disruptive player in the online grocery retail sector. It competes by focusing on improving its customer proposition to support growth and driving efficiency through scale, technology and operational improvements. The rating reflects our view of moderately high barriers to entry in grocery retailing due to low growth rates, rapid e-commerce development, the need to manage different temperature environments (fresh, frozen) in delivering products to consumers, supplier relationships, brand and identity. In the UK, aside from the  big four  retailers which manage online operations as a separate channel but struggle to increase market share, Amazon is also extending its grocery distribution offering - especially in south-east England. However, we do not currently see Amazon as the biggest threat as its service may struggle to achieve the extensive range of products, delivery capabilities and pricing of Ocado. Weak Profitability in 2017-18 to Improve: Ocado has an EBITDAR margin (similar to FFO) of 6%-7% which is solid for a grocery distribution business, especially relative to other online retailers where margins are often very low. This reflects Ocado's right-sized operations and appropriate cost base. We expect some weakness in EBITDAR margins in 2017-18 due to start-up costs associated with new operations of the Andover and Erith Customer Fulfilment Centres (CFCs) at a time of high competition. Over 2017-2018 we expect some downward pressure on gross margins, mitigated by cost optimisation. As we expect sales growth to stay on course, we assume Ocado will naturally benefit from greater operating leverage and should see its EBITDAR margin improve by around 80bp between 2018 and 2020. The rating is predicated upon free cash flow (FCF) achieving break-even in 2019-20 as we think that management will assess new expansionary projects then in light of the competitive landscape and funding environment. IP Licensing Provides Upside: We expect Ocado's cash flows will continue to stem from its own online grocery distribution business over the rating horizon. However, some upside exists from franchising its technology/intellectual property (IP) via its Solutions Business to other retail partners - in addition to other third-party arrangements with Morrisons and Dobbies Garden centres - as well as international retailers wishing to develop their online retail businesses. We expect only moderate absolute sales and profits from such contracts, but these would help diversify the group's income flows, providing some stability and visibility beyond its own retailing platform. Moderate Leverage over Rating Horizon: Ocado has a good record of profitable growth whilst maintaining a prudent balance sheet. Management sees leverage (net debt to EBITDA) of 2.5x as appropriate for the business, with temporary increases possible to accommodate capacity increases. At present the strategy is focused on organic growth with no M&A; or dividends, which we believe is sensible. In our view Ocado's conservative financial policy is an important safeguard for the rating. The degree of visibility over the next few years' sales growth mitigates the risk that remaining capex may drag FCF generation through to 2019. We project FFO adjusted leverage will peak at 4.7x, and then fall to 3.4x by 2020, a level fully compatible with a 'BB' rating category for the sector. This financial risk profile represents moderate refinancing risks. In our leverage computation we include 50% of the debt owed to MHE JVCo, in which Ocado and Morrisons own a 50% equity interest, to cover for any operational risks (and service execution) which we believe stays with Ocado, and 50% of debt owed to Morrisons - likely to be paid in service provision over the length of its long-term contract. Considerable Financial Flexibility: Following the planned debt refinancing, we expect Ocado will have sufficient financial flexibility to conduct its capex programme. This is supported by the group's clear commitment to maintain a conservative policy with only modest deviations allowed, a well-spread and long-dated debt maturity profile, and limited FX exposure. Moreover, we expect strong FFO fixed charge cover and EBITDAR to interest plus rents for the rating (in the range of 2.7- 3.7x over the rating horizon), aided by low operating leases. The level of leases is a key reflection of Ocado's different asset and cost base relative to traditional retailers. Above-Average Bond Recovery Expectations: Both the planned bond and RCF are first-lien and secured by pledges over all of the issued share capital of each guarantor. Based on the transitional recovery approach, we believe there is value available as a growing online grocery retailer and as a developing technology provider to attract enough interest from potential trade buyers in the event of distress. This results in the planned notes rated 'BB(EXP)', which is one notch higher than the IDR. The proposed guarantors represented, after deducting intercompany eliminations, GBP88.1 million, or 115.3%, of EBITDA (as defined in indenture) and GBP248.1 million, or 94.6%, of Ocado's net assets for the 52 weeks ended 27 November 2016. Even conservatively taking into account the debt owed to MHE JVCo (as it is not a guarantor of the planned notes and thus the debt at JV will rank senior to the notes), the level of priority debt to EBITDA would equate to around 1.5x. We expect this to fall over time driven by capital amortisation of lease payments staying well below the threshold of 2.0- 2.5x that Fitch considers material to trigger structural subordination for holding-company creditors. DERIVATION SUMMARY Ocado's 'BB-' IDR is well positioned relative to traditional food retail peers on each major comparative except scale and diversification. However, given Ocado's exclusive presence in the online channel, it benefits from positive sector trends which is reflected in its growing customer base and increasing market share in UK grocery as a whole and mostly in online. Ocado's profitability measured as FFO margin and EBITDAR margin trend is stronger than Tesco's (BB+/Stable) but capex will translate into negative FCF in 2017-18. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - increase in average basket size in the financial year to November 2017 (FY17) at a slower pace than inflation; - deterioration in EBITDA margin of up to 80bp by 2018 followed by improvement of similar magnitude by 2020 after completion of the CFC at Erith, on higher operating efficiency; - capex to peak at 12% of sales in FY17, fall to 10% of sales in FY18, and stabilise at around 6% thereafter partly dependent on funding available; - discretionary capex in FY17/FY18 (together almost GBP300 million) to be funded by CFO and proceeds from planned bond offering, around GBP70 million and GBP80 million in 2019/ 20 including technology investments; - no dividend payments over FY17-FY20; - FCF to remain negative in FY17/18 and breaking even in FY19. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Increasing scale and diversification either linked to greater product mix, continuing growth of its customer base (market share) or new partner retailers under the Solutions Business while maintaining an FFO margin consistently above 5% post-2018 demonstrating a more mature business risk profile -FFO-adjusted gross leverage trending to 3.5x on a sustained basis -Maintenance of solid financial flexibility including strong FFO fixed charge coverage and liquidity available - Prudent growth strategy reflected in higher share of capex funded internally leading to FCF neutral Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - FFO margin erosion to below 3% indicating slower than expected new capacity take up, weaker pricing power and/or intensifying competitive pressure in its own grocery distribution platform - FFO-adjusted gross leverage staying above 4.5x on a sustained basis - Diminished financial flexibility reflected by deterioration of liquidity position as a result of higher capex leading to continuing negative FCF in the mid-single digits of sales, worse working capital turnover, and/or FFO fixed charge coverage below 2.5x on a sustained basis LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Liquidity is sufficient to meet Ocado's short-term debt obligations and would be improved after the pending transaction of a new GBP200 million bond issue. The size of the RCF would be reduced from GBP210 million to GBP150 million as the cash proceeds from the bond issue will be used to repay the outstanding RCF of GBP87.5 million. The maturity of the RCF would be also extended from July 2019 to June 2022 and it is expected to remain undrawn after the transaction. We expect the group to use the additional liquidity to fund primarily its development of the Andover and Erith CFCs.

Seibert added it was still unclear when the remaining 27 EU members would decide on a joint position on the regulators, but Berlin was aiming for a deal at the EU summit on June 22. According to an EU paper seen by Reuters last month, member states will be asked to decide on new homes for the EMA and EBA by October 2017. The voting process will start with a verdict on the EMA, the larger of the two bodies, and the country selected for this body will not be able to host the banking watchdog as well.

In the legal action, filed in London's High Court, Natixis said it would seek damages from Marex because the bank provided finance based on fake receipts in a deal arranged by the broker. Marex rejected the claim and said it had issued a counterclaim against Glencore unit Access World because the warehouse operator had verified the receipts as being authentic.  We vigorously contest Natixis' claim,  Marex said in a statement.  Access World needs to explain how receipts that it had authenticated were subsequently cancelled.  Natixis acknowledged it had filed a lawsuit against Marex but declined to make any further comment. Access World's owner Glencore declined to comment.  Access World said on Jan. 21 that it has become aware of fake warehouse receipts circulating in its name and urged holders to seek authentication.  The legal action revolves around three trades in nickel warehouse receipts in late 2016 and early 2017.  Marex said it had the receipts authenticated by Access World and also had the physical metal inspected by Alfred H. Knight, an specialist metals inspection firm.  Alfred H. Knight did not reply to requests for comment. Marex said the fraud was uncovered when it sought to verify a fourth trade and Access World said the receipts were fraudulent as well as the previous receipts from the other three trades.    The $30 million of receipts in Natixis' claim represents the full extent of Marex's involvement in the receipts business.  If there is any larger fraud, it involves other market participants and not Marex Spectron,  Marex said. Metals markets were rocked about three years ago by a $3 billion fraud at Qingdao port in China, when a firm allegedly duplicated warehouse certificates to pledge metal as collateral for multiple bank loans.  Following the more recent fraud, some global banks briefly froze credit lines for Singapore metal traders, people familiar with the matter said at the time.

Sibanye said the strike, which has seen more than a dozen miners assaulted by those striking, was triggered by workers angered by a company drive to root out illegal miners which has included the arrest of employees for collusion and taking food down to the illegal miners working underground. Illegal gold mining has plagued South Africa for decades, with bullion pilfered from both disused and operating mines, and Sibanye has vowed it will clear all illegal miners from its shafts by January 2018. A company spokesman said on Monday the entire Cooke operation would remain closed for the rest of the week as the firm assessed the security situation.  We will review the situation again closer to the weekend,  the spokesman said. The illegal miners arrested have been forced to come to the surface because of the strike, which has emptied the shafts of employees, thereby starving them of their sources of food and water underground - an unintended consequence of the stoppage. Sibanye's Cooke site appeared quiet on Monday with the road to the Cooke 1 and 2 shafts blocked off by a chain strung along three barrels.  Everyone had gone home,  a local union source told Reuters. The Cooke operations are situated in the working class town of Westonaria, around 40 kilometres outside Johannesburg, which in the last three years has been hit by several violent protests over government services and high unemployment.

Analysis of the malware, known as Crash Override or Industroyer, indicates it was likely used in a December 2016 cyber attack that cut power in Ukraine, according to the firms, Slovakian security software maker ESET and U.S. critical-infrastructure security firm Dragos Inc. The discovery may stoke fears about cyber vulnerabilities in power grids that have intensified in the wake of the December Ukraine attack, and one a year earlier that also cut power in that nation. Ukraine authorities have previously blamed Russia for the attacks on its grid. Moscow has denied responsibility. Dragos founder Robert M. Lee said the malware is capable of causing outages of up to a few days in portions of a nation's grid, but is not potent enough to bring down a country's entire grid. The firm has alerted government authorities and power companies about the threat, advising them of steps to defend against the threat, Lee said in an interview. Crash Override can be detected if a utility specifically monitors its network for abnormal traffic, including signs that the malware is searching for the location of substations or sending messages to switch breakers, according to Lee, a former U.S. Air Force warfare operations officer. The sample of Crash Override that was analysed by Dragos is capable of attacking power operators across Europe, according to Lee.  With small modifications, it could be leveraged against the United States,  he said. Reuters reviewed an ESET technical analysis of the malware provided by the security firm, which they planned to release publicly on Monday. An ESET spokeswoman said the firm's researchers were not available for comment ahead of its release. ESET said in its report that it believed the malware was  very probably  used in the 2016 attack in Ukraine, noting it has an activation time stamp of Dec. 17, the day of the outage. Crash Override is the second piece of malware discovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes, according to Lee. The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program. Malware has been used in other attacks on industrial targets, including the 2015 Ukraine power outage, but in those cases human intervention was required to interfere with operations, Lee said.

The best way to do that, he says, is to cut out humans. About 200 nuclear reactors around the world will be shut down over the next quarter century, mostly in Europe, according to the International Energy Agency. That means a lot of work for the half a dozen companies that specialize in the massively complex and dangerous job of dismantling plants. Those firms â including Areva (AREVA.PA), Rosatom's Nukem Technologies Engineering Services, and Toshiba's (6502.T) Westinghouse â are increasingly turning away from humans to do this work and instead deploying robots and other new technologies.  That is transforming an industry that until now has mainly relied on electric saws, with the most rapid advances being made in the highly technical area of dismantling a reactor's core â the super-radioactive heart of the plant where the nuclear reactions take place. The transformation of the sector is an engineering one, but companies are also looking to the new technology to cut time and costs in a competitive sector with slim margins. Dismantling a nuclear power plant can take decades and cost up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), depending on its size and age. The cost of taking apart the plant in Muelheim-Kaerlich will be about 800 million euros, according to sources familiar with the station's economics. Some inroads have already been made: a programmable robot arm developed by Areva has reduced the time it takes to dismantle some of the most contaminated components of a plant by 20-30 percent compared with conventional cutting techniques. For Areva and rival Westinghouse, reactor dismantling is unlikely to make an impact on the dire financial straits they are mired in at present as it represents just a small part of their businesses, which are dominated by plant-building. But it nonetheless represents a rare area of revenue growth; the global market for decommissioning services is expected to nearly double to $8.6 billion by 2021, from $4.8 billion last year, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets. Such growth could prove important for the two companies should they weather their current difficulties.   We're not talking about the kind of margins Apple is making on its iPhone,  said Thomas Eichhorn, head of Areva's German dismantling activities.  But it's a business with a long-term perspective.  When reactors were built in the 1970s, they were designed to keep radiation contained inside at all costs, with little thought given to those who might be tearing them down more than 40 years later. First, engineers need to remove the spent nuclear fuel rods stored in reactor buildings â but only after they've cooled off. At Muelheim-Kaerlich this took about two years in total. Then peripheral equipment such as turbines need to be removed, a stage Muelheim-Kaerlich has begun and which can take several years. Finally, the reactor itself needs to be taken apart and the buildings demolished, which takes about a decade. Some of the most highly contaminated components are cocooned in concrete and placed in iron containers that will be buried deep underground at some point.  Robots Under Water  While the more mundane tasks, including bringing down the plants' outer walls, are left to construction groups such as Hochtief (HOTG.DE), it's the dismantling of the reactor's core where more advanced skills matter â and where the use of technology has advanced most in recent years. Enter companies such as Areva, Westinghouse, Nukem Technologies, GE Hitachi (GE.N) (6501.T) as well as GNS, owned by Germany's four nuclear plant operators. They have all begun using robots and software to navigate their way into the reactor core, or pressure vessel.  The most difficult task is the dismantling of the reactor pressure vessel, where the remaining radioactivity is highest,  said Volmar, who took charge of the RWE-owned (RWEG.DE) Muelheim-Kaerlich plant two years ago.  We leave this to a specialized expert firm.          A Worker in the nuclear reactor of the nuclear power plant that will be dismantled in Muelheim-Kaerlich, Germany, May 22, 2017.Thilo SchmuelgenThe vessel â which can be as high as 13 meters and weigh up to 700 tonnes â is hidden deep inside the containment building that is shaped like a sphere to ensure its 30-centimetre thick steel wall is evenly strained in case of an explosion. The 2011 Fukushima disaster and the Chernobyl accident of 1986 are imprinted in the world's consciousness as examples of the catastrophic consequences of the leakage of radioactive material. France's Areva recently won the contract to dismantle the pressure vessel internals at Vattenfall's 806 megawatt (MW) Brunsbuettel nuclear plant in Germany, which includes an option for the Swedish utility's 1,402 MW Kruemmel site. There, the group will for the first time use its new AZURo programmable robot arm. It hopes this will help it outstrip rivals in what is the world's largest dismantling market following Germany's decision to close all its last nuclear plants by 2022, in response to the Fukushima disaster. AZURo operates under water because the liquid absorbs radiation from the vessel components â reducing the risk of leakage and contamination of the surrounding area. The chamber is flooded before its work begins. Slideshow (18 Images)Areva's German unit invests about 5 percent of its annual sales, or about 40 million euros, in research and development, including in-house innovation such as AZURo. By comparison, the world's 1,000 largest corporate R&D; spenders, on average, spent 4.2 percent last year, according to PwC. The robot arm technology helped Areva beat Westinghouse by winning tenders to dismantle pressure vessel internals at EnBW's (EBKG.DE) Philippsburg 2 and Gundremmingen 2 blocks, industry sources familiar with the matter said. Areva and EnBW both declined to comment. Westinghouse â whose U.S. business filed for bankruptcy in March â did not respond to repeated requests for comment.  Time and Money Britain's OC Robotics has built the LaserSnake2, a flexible 4.5-metre snake arm, which can operate in difficult spaces and uses a laser to increase cutting speeds â thus reducing the risk of atmospheric contamination. It was tested at the Sellafield nuclear site in west Cumbria last year. This followed France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), whose laser-based dismantling technology generates fewer radioactive aerosols â a key problem during cutting â than other technologies. The complexity of the dismantling process is also giving rise to modeling software that maps out the different levels of radiation on plant parts, making it easier to calculate the most efficient sequence of dismantling â the more contaminated parts are typically dealt with first â and gives clarity over what safety containers will be needed to store various components. GNS, which is jointly owned by E.ON (EONGn.DE), RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall, is currently helping to dismantle the German Neckarwestheim 1 and Philippsburg 1 reactors, using its software to plan the demolition. The company also hopes to supply its software services for the dismantling of PreussenElektra's Isar 1 reactor, which is being tendered, and aims to expand to other European countries.  Two things matter: time and money,  said Joerg Viermann, head of sales of waste management activities at GNS.   The less I have to cut, the sooner I will be done and the less I will spend.

Though there were two M&A; issues last week, Intrum Justitia, with its size and expected Ba2/BB+/BB ratings, appears to be the kind of new issue investors have been crying out. Most of the proceeds will refinance existing debt for the Swedish credit management services company's merger with Norwegian peer Lindorff.  It's exactly what the market wants,  said a lead banker.  It's new supply, M&A; related, and in that rating spectrum where you're not taking on a lot of credit risk.  The borrower is planning three euro tranches: a minimum â¬300m 5NC1 FRN, a minimum â¬500m 5NC2 fixed, and a minimum â¬500m 7NC3 fixed. It is also looking to sell a minimum â¬300m-equivalent 5NC1 FRN in Swedish kronor. The biggest deal so far this year was from Quintiles IMS, which raised â¬1.425bn through an 8NC3 senior note in February. Of the proceeds from Intrum Justitia's bond, â¬2.4bn will repay debt taken out in relation to the merger.  That's why I think this deal is going to have a really nice technical around it. More than two thirds of the deal is in the hands of people who know about it, so it is rolling in a lot of existing money,  said the banker. Goldman Sachs (B&D;), JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Danske Bank, Deutsche Bank, DNB Markets, Nordea, Nykredit, Swedbank and UBS are joint bookrunners.

Meijer AMSTERDAM, June 12 (Reuters) - The Dutch central bank on Monday raised its 2017 forecast for economic growth in the Netherlands to 2.5 percent, saying strong international trade and corporate investments will bring the strongest expansion in a decade. The DNB in January had forecast 2.3 percent growth for this year.  Things are going very well at the moment,  DNB director Job Swank told journalists.  Although our economy remains dependent on sometimes turbulent developments elsewhere, optimism prevails.  The fifth-largest economy in the euro zone will maintain  strong momentum  in the coming years, but a slowing of world trade and the housing market in the Netherlands will ease the pace of expansion to around 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, it said. Unemployment in the Netherlands, one of the top economic performers in the euro zone, will drop to its lowest level since 2010 this year at 5 percent and will continue declining in the coming years, putting upward pressure on wages. Higher income and rising house prices will further stimulate consumer spending, while inflation will remain modest, with projected rates of just over 1 percent until 2019. Investments by companies, meanwhile, will reach the highest level in 40 years, measured as a share of GDP, helped by profit growth and easing financial constraints. The strong economy will also strengthen government finances, with the budget surplus estimated to reach 1.1 percent of GDP in 2019, up from 0.4 percent in 2016. Swank called this a  healthy buffer  that will help the next Dutch government.  With a surplus of around 1 percent you don't have to hit the brakes so hard during bad times,  he said. After nearly three months of negotiations, the main Dutch political parties have yet to form a coalition government. Although domestic spending has played a significant part in the recovery of the Dutch economy after the financial crisis, exports will contribute almost half of total GDP growth in 2017. The DNB warned that a rising wave of trade protectionism globally could pose a serious threat to the relatively small and open economy of the Netherlands. Trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other countries could potentially reduce Dutch economic growth to slightly above 1.5 percent in 2018-2019, it said.

With the victory, the Penguins clinched the best-of-seven championship 4-2 to win the franchise's fifth Stanley Cup. They also became the NHL's first repeat champion since Detroit did it 19 years ago. Penguins captain Sidney Crosby, who was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs, said his team had worked hard to keep improving with each game.  All playoffs long we got better as each series went on,  he added.  We tried to do that this series and I thought we did a good job of that.  Related CoveragePenguins' Crosby wins Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVPPredators' improbable playoff run ends in heartbreakList of Conn Smythe Trophy winnersHornqvist scored the game-winning goal with only 95 seconds left when he batted a puck that had bounced off the end boards out of mid air, off the net and off goaltender Pekka Rinne's back and into the goal. Hagelin iced the game with 14 seconds left when, with Rinne out of the goal in favor of an extra attacker, he scored into the empty net.

Mandatory Credit: Dave Sandford/NHLI/Pool Photo via USA TODAY SportsPenguins goaltender Matt Murray made 27 saves for his second straight shutout but caught a huge break early in the second period when the referee lost sight of the puck and mistakenly blew his whistle to stop play moments before Predators forward Colton Sissons poked home a rebound. The referee thought Murray had the puck but it had actually trickled just behind him and into the crease where Sissons had what should have been the opening goal. Slideshow (21 Images)Sissons had another chance to put his team in front at the midway mark of the period when Pittsburgh got caught on a bad line change but he was denied by Murray on the breakaway chance. Pittsburgh had two close calls in the final minute of what was the best period yet of the Final series but were denied by Predators goalie Rinne and hit a post seconds later. For Nashville, the loss brought an end to a magical playoff run for the lowest seed in the Western Conference after they posted upset wins over top-seeded Chicago, division-winning Anaheim and a St. Louis squad that posted 99 points in the regular season.  It stings,  said Predators defenseman P.K. Subban.  A lot of emotions, a lot of tears and there should be. Everybody cares and we obviously wanted to lift the Cup this year but it didn't happen.   The biggest thing we got to take from this is remember the feeling. Let it sink in and take it because to get back here that's what's going to drive us.

A man and his two sons were killed at their home in Ghani Khel, a district in the south of Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan, said Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor.  After the bomb blast hit them, the American forces then started shooting and killed one man and two children nearby,  he said.  The U.S. military command in Kabul said a convoy of American and Afghan troops was struck by a roadside bomb and attacked by gunmen.  The convoy returned fire in self-defence and there were no U.S. casualties,  the command said in a statement. Related CoverageU.S.: No civilian casualties officially reported in Afghan incidentThere had been no official report of civilian casualties filed, but the military was investigating the incident, the U.S. military said in a statement.  We take civilian casualties very seriously and all allegations are thoroughly investigated,  it said. Civilian casualties have run at near record highs as fighting spreads to more areas of Afghanistan, according to the United Nations. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani generally has been less vocal than his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, in publicly criticising the U.S. military when troops are involved in incidents where civilians are killed. On Saturday, three American soldiers were killed and one wounded when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in Nangarhar, where elite U.S. troops have been helping Afghan forces battle Islamic State militants. Also over the weekend, an American air strike in southern Afghanistan killed at least three Afghan policemen and wounded several during a joint operation by Afghan and U.S. special forces. U.S. and Afghan troops have been battling militants in Nangarhar province for months. Islamic State, or Daesh as it is known in Afghanistan, has established a stronghold in the region, which borders Pakistan. U.S. military officials estimate there are about 600 to 800 Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan, mostly in Nangarhar, but also in the neighboring province of Kunar.  The increase in involvement by U.S troops and warplanes comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration weighs whether to deploy more troops in the war-torn country. Reuters reported in late April that the U.S. administration was carrying out a review of Afghanistan and there were conversations over whether to send between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops to Afghanistan. Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters. This could allow U.S. advisers to work with Afghan troops below the corps level, potentially putting them closer to fighting, a U.S. official said.

There was some support for the euro from French and Italian elections but the week was set to be dominated by central bank meetings and UK Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to form a workable administration after losing her majority. With a fourth rise in U.S. rates in 18 months now fully priced-in for Wednesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's head of G10 currency strategy, Athanasios Vamvakidis, pointed to the chance of a weaker greenback after the meeting. But he also warned that the Bank of Japan just over 24 hours later might prompt some more retracement of the yen's 4-percent gain since mid-May.  The hike by the Fed is fully priced but the language will be dovish,  Vamvakidis said.  What will be interesting will be the BOJ - there have been headlines that the BOJ has been discussing an exit from emergency stimulus. They may well want to bite back against that (and) the yen has come a long way in the past few weeks.  The dollar was marginally lower at 110.21 yen, having retreated from Friday's one-week high of 110.815 yen. Against the euro it dipped a quarter percent to $1.1222, compared to a seven-month low of $1.1285 set in early June. As May scrambles to pick up the pieces and reunite her Conservative Party before Brexit negotiations due to start next week, the economic signs for the pound continue to worsen. Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers cut their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month, as households turned more cautious even before the shock election result. Against that is the hope of a softer approach to the Brexit talks that Friday's election results have engendered in markets. Worries that the process would take Britain out of the lucrative European single market have left the pound around 20 cents weaker than when Britain voted to leave the European Union a year ago.  Based on parliament as it stands, Theresa May would be able to approve a soft Brexit but not a hard one,  said Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Vamvakidis. Sterling fell another half a percent in morning trade, sinking as low as $1.2681, and 88.45 pence per euro.  Our forecasts are under review but we have been one of the more bullish houses on the street and it is fairly clear that the risks are to the downside,  said Barclays' strategist Hamish Pepper.  The uncertainty that the result brings means that you have a degree of risk premia re-establishing itself. The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.

Over the next week, five of the largest U.S. banks will light up their segments of a new payments network called Zelle, executives said in interviews. They plan to announce details of the launch on Monday, and expect another two dozen banks and credit unions to join over the next year. The long-awaited network will allow tens of millions of bank customers to send money to each other instantly - known as person-to-person payments - with a few taps on their smartphones. That is an improvement over Venmo, which immediately alerts users that a money transfer is in progress, but takes time to shift funds between bank accounts. Customers who use existing bank payment apps may not notice much of a change beyond marketing. Transfers will simply happen faster because the banks are finally linking to each other, executives said.  By coming together to offer Zelle, we are providing a large majority of Americans with a safe, fast and easy way to move money,  said Bill Wallace, head of digital at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the biggest U.S. bank by assets. JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) will be the first to plug into Zelle. The network is the product of an industry consortium called Early Warning Services LLC, whose seven owners have more than 86 million U.S. mobile banking customers. Zelle took years to establish because fierce rivals had to come together to make it work. In the interim, Silicon Valley has made inroads into digital payments, particularly with the young customers coveted by banks. In addition to Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) all offer payment platforms that allow individuals to send money to each other. The banks want to leap over those sleek but scattered offerings by connecting their critical mass of account holders through a single network. A person uses the Venmo app on a mobile phone in this undated image. REUTERS Fragmentation has been frustrating for consumers,  said Paul Finch, chief executive of Early Warning.  Inconsistent experiences have made it difficult to send and receive money between banks.  Despite losing some ground to technology companies, banks still have a big advantage: No matter what network is used to transfer money, banks hold the vast majority of funds. FILE PHOTO - A view of the exterior of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City, U.S. on May 20, 2015.Mike Segar/File Photo - RTSW2DWAnd despite the popularity of apps like Venmo, they transfer far less money than banks. The value of digital payments processed through non-financial firms was one-fifth of what banks and credit unions processed last year, research firm Aite Group estimates.  We are excited to bring the service to everybody and anybody, regardless of which brand of phone you have in your hand or which generation you belong to,  said Gareth Gaston, head of omnichannel banking at U.S. Bank. Along with building customer loyalty, banks hope that Zelle will reduce their costs from handling checks and cash. Eventually, they would like to sell access to businesses that want to eliminate their own paper-related costs. As more banks connect and more customers use the service, sending cash to another individual will simply involve knowing the person's mobile phone number or email address. Later this year, individuals with accounts at banks not connected with Zelle will be able to use its real-time features by downloading an app and pairing it with a Visa Inc (V.N) or Mastercard Inc (MA.N) debit account. In launching Zelle, banks are being careful not to confuse customers by offering yet another payments app. For instance, Chase will initially twin the brand with the QuickPay app its customers already use by showing  QuickPay with Zelle  on its mobile app and website. Eventually, the QuickPay name could fade away.

Jean-Michel Six cited expectations that Angela Merkel will secure a fourth term as German chancellor after federal elections in September as another factor reducing political uncertainty in the currency bloc.    The two biggest countries in the euro zone will emerge from 2017 politically and economically stronger,  Six, who is Chief EMEA Economist at S&P; Global Ratings, told the AJEF association of financial journalists.   There has been a remarkable change in sentiment. Sentiment about what's going on in France, and therefore in the euro zone, has changed in an incredible way in just a few weeks.  Running as an independent centrist, Macron became France's youngest ever president in May and his fledgling Republic on the Move party and its Modem ally won 32.32 percent of votes in the first round of the parliamentary election on Sunday. Pollsters project they could win between 390 and 445 seats in the 577-seat lower house in the June 18 second round, a margin of victory that would ensure Macron can push through the pro-business reforms the former investment banker has promised. These include an easing of stringent labor laws and reforms to an unwieldy pension system.  We are reviewing our forecasts at the moment. We'll likely raise our forecasts for France and countries in the euro zone,  Six said. S&P;'s current forecast of 1.5 percent growth for France in 2017 could be raised to between 1.7 and 1.8 percent, he added, although France's continuing lack of competitiveness meant higher growth could lead to a higher trade deficit. Six said political uncertainty and slow growth in Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro zone, remained a big risk for investors but that the success of Macron's pro-Europe party in France could set an example for Italy and others.  There could be another scenario which is a Macron contagion, because of the cultural similarities,  he said. Six also expects Greece to reach a deal with creditors but doubted any delay could derail the outlook for the euro zone.  Greece is no longer a systemic risk,  he said.

Banking regulators from across the world meet on Wednesday and Thursday in Sweden in a fresh bid to get agreement on completing Basel III, a set of tougher capital requirements initiated in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis. But no final deal is likely this week given that France, backed by Germany and the Netherlands, is unhappy with the package on the table, which aims to ensure that banks are consistent in how they measure risks from loans to determine capital buffers, bankers and other sources said on Monday.  We are not going to get a deal,  one person familiar with the Basel Committee negotiations said. The main stumbling block is a proposed  floor  which would mean capital cannot fall below 75 percent of the  standard  approach set out by regulators and used by most lenders, while big banks use models to add up risks instead.  Some are unhappy about the 75 percent because it is too high, some don't like it because it is too low, but everyone has signalled a willingness to agree on a certain number,  the person said. While European banks fear they will have to find significant amounts of extra capital under what they dub Basel IV, the United States does not want the floor set too low. The Bank of France, a member of the Basel Committee, referred on Monday to comments by its governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau in May when he said he wanted to complete a Basel package based on improved and better supervised internal models.  It is better to give it some time to reach a good agreement than to rush to bad arrangements,  de Galhau said last month. A Paris-based banking executive said he wanted to ask French President Emmanuel Macron for a global moratorium on new capital rules at the G20 level, although bankers also fear that France could end up being isolated. The hope is that enough progress is made this week for it to be referred for the second time this year to Basel's oversight body to broker a final deal before momentum runs out.  There is a clear sense of fatigue,  the person said. Basel has already signalled that the package could take up to a decade to come in to soften the hit to a few  outliers .

Baker,Naomi Tajitsu,Satoshi Tsunakawa,Stephen D. Milligan,TOSHIBA,ACCOUNTING/ (UPDATE 2),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"TOKYO, June 12 (Reuters) - Western Digital Corp plans to raise its offer for Toshiba Corp's prized semiconductor unit to $18 billion or more, a person familiar with the matter said, in a last-ditch effort to clinch a deal both companies consider vital. The U.S. chipmaker is part of a consortium led by a Japanese government-backed fund. The group will present the new offer of 2 trillion yen or more by Thursday, when the struggling Japanese conglomerate is due to choose a preferred bidder for its Toshiba Memory Corp unit, the world's second-largest producer of NAND memory chips, the person told Reuters on Saturday. Toshiba has been favouring a rival bid from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake to offer 2.2 trillion yen, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. A spokesman for Western Digital had no comment. Toshiba could not immediately be reached for comment. Toshiba had set a 2 trillion yen threshold for the sale as it rushes to find a buyer to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp. The offer by Western Digital, a long-time partner of the laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate's lucrative chips division, comes as uncertainty about the make-up of the groups bidding for Toshiba's crown jewel has increased. Western Digital has been seen by some sources as crucial to successful deal, as it jointly operates a key flash-memory chip plant with Toshiba in western Japan. At Loggerheads But the two companies have been at loggerheads over the auction. Western Digital is pursuing an international arbitration claim that Toshiba has breached joint-venture contracts by entertaining outside bids. Western Digital argues that the sale cannot proceed without its consent but the U.S. firm will drop its claim if Toshiba agrees to the new offer, the source said on Saturday. Toshiba is concerned an acquisition by Western Digital would run into antitrust objections from China and elsewhere as the U.S. firm is the world's third-largest NAND producer behind South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co and Toshiba. To counter those concerns, the Western Digital portion of the consortium's new offer will be in the form of a debt purchase whereas the U.S. firm had previously been looking for an equity stake in Toshiba Memory, the source said. The Japan-Western Digital consortium initially offered 1.6 trillion yen, sources have said. CEO Steve Milligan then raised the offer to close to 2 trillion yen on Friday in a meeting with Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa, the source said on Saturday. But Toshiba expressed dissatisfaction with Friday's bid.  Our concerns about the prospects of success for a deal were not wiped out,  a Toshiba spokeswoman said. That set the stage for the latest offer of 2 trillion yen, or more. In Friday's meeting, Toshiba's Tsunakawa asked if Western Digital  could further increase the price , the source said, adding that the U.S. firm would modify its proposal,  to align with their thinking . Western Digital's new offer will also include a commitment to $25 billion dollars in capital spending for the joint venture's Yokkaichi facility, including building two fabrication plants, the source said. It will also pledge $39 billion for research and development and money to boost the local economy, while expanding the workforce there by five percent a year for two years, he said.

The decision by Israel's security cabinet is expected to shorten by 45 minutes the daily average of four hours of power that Gaza's 2 million residents receive from an electricity grid dependent on Israeli supplies, the officials said. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) blamed Hamas's failure to reimburse it for electricity for the reduction in power supplies. But PA spokesman Tareq Rashmawi coupled that explanation with a demand that Hamas agree to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's unity initiatives, which include holding the first parliamentary and presidential elections in more than a decade.  We renew the call to the Hamas movement and the de facto government there to hand over to us all responsibilities of government institutions in Gaza so that the government can provide its best services to our people in Gaza,  he said. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said Israel and the Palestinian Authority  will bear responsibility for the grave deterioration  in Gaza's health and environmental situation. A Palestinian woman lights a candle inside her house during power cut in the southern Gaza Strip.Ibraheem Abu MustafaAny worsening to Gaza's power crisis - its main electrical plant is off-line in a Hamas-PA dispute over taxation - could cause the collapse of health services already reliant on stand-alone generators, many of them in a poor state of repair, Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza, said.  Israel charges the PA 40 million shekels ($11 million) a month for electricity, deducting that from the transfers of Palestinian tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Authority. Israel does not engage with Hamas, which it considers a terrorist group. Slideshow (5 Images)Last month, the Palestinian Authority informed Israel that it would cover only 70 percent of the monthly cost of electricity that the Israel Electric Corporation supplies to the Gaza Strip. At the security cabinet session late on Sunday, ministers decided that Israel would not make up the shortfall, the officials said.  This is a decision by (Abbas) ... Israelis paying Gaza's electricity bill is an impossible situation,  Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said on Army Radio. Israeli military and security chiefs backed the move, despite concern Hamas could respond by increasing hostilities with Israel. Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip from Abbas's Fatah movement in 2007, and several attempts at reconciliation, most recently in 2014, have failed. Hamas has accused Abbas of trying to turn the screw on them to make political concessions.

He gave no indication of timing. Hulot told reporters at the G7 environment summit in the Italian city of Bologna that it was too early to give numbers about France's aim to reduce the share of nuclear in its power generation to 50 percent from the current 75 percent.   We are going to close some nuclear reactors and it won't be just a symbolic move,  he said. EDF shares, which were down 0.8 percent before Hulot's comments, immediately fell further to stand 2.2 percent lower.  FILE PHOTO: A view of France's oldest Electricite de France (EDF) nuclear power station is seen in Fessenheim near Colmar, Eastern France, April 10, 2011.Vincent Kessler/File PhotoAsked about the possibility of introducing a carbon tax, Hulot said  France already has a carbon tax which we increase every year. At an EU level we want to increase the threshold,  he said.  Hulot's predecessor as environment minister, Segolene Royal, said in May last year that France would unilaterally introduce a carbon price floor of about 30 euros ($33) a ton with a view to kick-start broader European action to cut emissions and drive forward the December 2015 United Nations-led international climate accord. However, the socialist government quietly dropped that plan toward the end of last year as unions protested that it would lead to coal plant closures.  EDF Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy has repeatedly called for a minimum carbon price of between 30 euros and 40 euros per ton in France and Europe, which would boost the company's carbon-free nuclear power stations. Carbon prices under the European Emissions Trading System, which charges companies for each ton of carbon dioxide they emit, have fallen to about 5 euros a ton from about 30 euros in 2008 because of a glut of permits.

There were some inward remittances and the (importer) demand was there from a state bank, probably to settle some oil bills,  a currency dealer said, requesting anonymity. The rupee has been under pressure after central bank governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said last month the bank would allow gradual depreciation of the currency. The central bank has set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year. The spot rupee, which the central bank had fixed at 152.50 since May 5, did not trade on Monday. Foreign investors bought a net 1.37 billion rupees ($8.98 million) worth of government securities in the week ended June 7. They have sold a net 39.96 billion rupees worth of securities so far this year. Trading was dull as investors assessed the extent of damage to the economy from recent floods and landslides. The country's main agricultural crops - tea and rubber - were hit by the worst torrential rains in 14 years. Damage to agricultural exports would put pressure on the rupee, currency dealers said. However, they added there was some optimism over expected inflows in the form of international assistance that could help offset potential downward pressure on the local currency. While the inflows are likely to help the rupee, the central bank would have to tighten interest rates to curb unnecessary credit growth and inflationary pressure, they said. The floods could hurt overall economic growth and also widen the government's budget deficit with high infrastructure spending.

Europe's tech stocks fell 3.5 percent, knocked by a similar slide on Wall Street on Friday. Apple shares, a bellwether for the sector, were down more than 2 percent in U.S. pre-market trading on Monday, suggesting more weakness ahead. Chipmakers, which supply to Apple and other smartphone companies, bore the brunt of the selloff in Europe. Shares of STMicro fell 8 percent while Dialog Semi slumped more than 5 percent. Brokers including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan have stepped up warnings in recent weeks on how much further the rally in cyclical stocks -- or those most geared to economic growth, such as banks, industrials and technology -- has to run. Morgan Stanley downgraded its view on the European tech sector to  underweight  last week citing valuations, while Goldman Sachs published a similarly cautious view on U.S. tech stocks last Friday. The selloff, which began in earnest on Wall Street, where shares of Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet along with Apple took a hammering on Friday, has spread to Asia and Europe sparking fears of broader market weakness.  This is the nature of the tech sector. Valuations do from time to time become very stretched and they come back and anyone who has paid a very high valuation might experience some short-term pain,  said Fergus Shaw, fund manager at Cerno Capital. In Europe, the regional tech index was up 24 percent before Monday's slide and finished last week at its highest level in 15 years, easily outpacing other sectors. Those gains have lifted stock valuations to their highest since 2004. At 21 times forward earnings, they remain well short of the dizzying heights reached during the dotcom boom and bust when valuations hit more than 70 times. But the ensuing crash still haunts investors in the sector. With the year's best performing sector off sharply there are worries that weakness could spread to other economically sensitive stocks where resurgent investor interest has also pushed up valuations. Morgan Stanley strategists said last week that cyclical stocks' weighting in the MSCI Europe index was at a 20-year high, and a couple of percentage points of their tech-bubble peak. They recommended investors switch into dividend-paying sectors such as real estate and telecoms which have been out of favour so far this year.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/europe-stocks-technology-idUSL8N1J91MX"},

The issue ratings on Bahrain's senior unsecured foreign and local currency long-term bonds have been affirmed at 'BB+'. The ratings on the sukuk trust certificates issued by CBB International Sukuk Company 5 have also been affirmed at 'BB+'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'BBB+' and the Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs at 'B'. The issue ratings on Bahrain's senior unsecured local-currency short-term bonds have been affirmed at 'B'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Bahrain's ratings are supported by high GDP per capita and human development indicators (relative even to the BBB median), a developed financial sector and the boost to external financing flexibility from strong GCC support. The strengths are balanced by double-digit fiscal deficits, high and rising debt, a highly oil-dependent government budget and domestic political tensions that hamper fiscal adjustment. The revision of the Outlook to Negative reflects the following key rating drivers: Beyond various near-term measures to rein in the fiscal deficit, the government has yet to identify a clear medium-term strategy to tackle high deficits and a rapidly growing government debt ratio. The lack of a medium-term fiscal framework, combined with the absence of the two-year budget for 2017 and 2018 six months into the budget period, creates increasing uncertainty around the outlook for debt and deficits. The government deficit widened to 16.2% of GDP in 2016 from 15.4% in 2015, with subsidy reforms not fully offsetting a decline in oil revenue, and interest costs undermining savings elsewhere on expenditure. Although Fitch expects the deficit to narrow to 10.2% of GDP by 2018, this will be insufficient to stabilise the debt trajectory. Under Fitch's baseline assumptions, which include a moderate rise in oil prices and implementation of fiscal measures already identified, debt will continue to rise, hitting 100% of GDP in 2026 (from 74% of GDP in 2016). Fitch's deficit numbers include estimated extra budgetary spending of 2.6% of GDP. In Fitch's view, the slow progress towards the new budget and a medium-term fiscal strategy reflects the difficulty of building consensus over the next wave of fiscal consolidation measures. Reining in the deficit further could call for deeper reforms to Bahrain's social and economic model, traditionally characterised by low taxation and generous benefits. In Fitch's view, the country's leadership is generally committed to reform, but this commitment is not yet shared by other stakeholders, and the government remains wary of social pressures. Bahrain's 'BB+' rating also reflects the following key rating drivers: Fitch expects hydrocarbon revenue to rise by around 28% and non-hydrocarbon revenue to rise by about 16% in 2017. Gradual increases in administered gas and fuel prices partly offset the negative effect of weak oil prices on hydrocarbon revenue in 2016 and will augment revenue increase this year. The government has already introduced higher fees for various government services and a fee on certain commodities ahead of GCC-wide implementation of an excise tax. The government is working to introduce a VAT in 2018 in line with agreement among GCC states, which could provide a fiscal boost in the region of 2% of GDP, according to IMF estimates. Fitch assumes that this implementation will be delayed from early 2018 into 2H18, given the magnitude of the technical challenges involved. Spending was flat in 2016, and Fitch expects it to grow at well below GDP growth in 2017-2018. Subsidy expenditure fell almost 8% in 2016 and a schedule of gradual increases to water and electricity tariffs holds out the promise of a further 4-5% decline per year in the subsidy bill in 2017 and 2018. Capital spending also fell by around 7% and will shrink further as the government's project pipeline is increasingly financed through the GCC Development Fund. The government's nominal wage bill was roughly constant in 2016, with significant government efforts to contain benefits and allowances to its employees offsetting the effect of a 1.5%-3% increase to base salaries. Fitch expects real GDP growth of 2.4% per year in 2017-2018. This reflects constant hydrocarbon volumes (after a slight fall in 2016) and a moderation of non-hydrocarbon growth to 3% from an estimated 3.7% in 2016. Spending on projects financed by the USD7.5 billion (20% of GDP) GCC Development Fund provides the most significant support to growth amid government retrenchment. Some USD3.1 billion of projects had been awarded to contractors at end-2016, up from USD1.1 billion at end-2015. Growth is also supported by state-owned enterprise projects (in oil, gas, and aluminium) and strong GCC demand for Bahrain real estate. Growth of credit to the private sector slowed to an estimated 2.5% in 2016 after 8.8% in 2015. Banks would be well-placed to extend more credit to the economy, given their sound profitability, high capitalisation and liquidity, and low non-performing loan levels. However, deposit growth has slowed and the high yields on government debt make some private sector lending unattractive. As a result, Fitch expects growth of credit to the private sector to stay muted at 2%-3% per year. The GCC Development Fund reflects the broader support that Bahrain enjoys from some GCC countries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. This support is rooted in deep historical, cultural and familial ties as well as regional rivalries. Bahrain gets most of its oil from the Abu Sa'afa field shared with Saudi Arabia (it is entitled to 50% of production, but has sometimes received significantly more as a form of support). In Fitch's view, further material support from the GCC would be forthcoming in case of extreme political, financial, or fiscal instability, given Bahrain's small size and strategic importance. The expectation of such support has helped to maintain Bahrain's market access and US dollar peg despite low foreign exchange reserves, which had fallen to an estimated 1.2 months of current external payments at end-2016. Fitch expects Bahrain's recent severing of ties with Qatar to have a limited direct dampening effect on growth. Qataris make up slightly more than 1% of inbound arrivals to Bahrain, but loss of flights from Doha and heightened risk perceptions could deter some non-GCC visitors (currently more than a third of the total). Qatar had not been contributing to the GCC Development Fund, but some private real estate investment will likely be forgone. The ban on flights by Qatar Airways could provide an opportunity for state-owned Gulf Air to seize market share on regional routes and reduce reliance on government subsidies. Tensions continue between the government and the predominantly Shia opposition, resulting in sporadic and isolated incidents of violence and clashes with security forces. Courts have now banned the two main opposition groups, which boycotted the previous election and were charged with fomenting violence and terrorism. Fitch's baseline assumption is that Bahrain's security forces will continue to prevent the sort of escalation of domestic tensions that would materially affect economic growth. However, Fitch believes that the government's recently more hard-line stance increases the risk of instability, notwithstanding a tight security environment and strong regional support. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Bahrain a score equivalent to a rating of 'BB+' on the Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - External Finances: +1 notch, to reflect the boost to external financing flexibility from strong GCC support; - Public Finances: -1 notch, to reflect a rising debt trajectory and the rigidity of government revenue and expenditure. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year-centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that could lead to negative rating action are: - Failure to shrink the fiscal deficit and set out a clear path towards stabilising the government debt-to-GDP ratio; - Severe deterioration of the domestic security environment. The main factors that could lead to positive rating action are: - A narrowing of the budget deficit consistent with a decline of the government debt-to-GDP ratio in the medium term; - A broadly accepted political solution to domestic political tensions. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that Brent crude will average USD52.5/bbl in 2017 and USD55/bbl in 2018. Fitch assumes no change to the rule of the royal family. Fitch assumes that regional conflicts will not directly impact Bahrain or its ability to trade. Fitch assumes no change to the peg of the Bahraini dinar to the US dollar.

The 31-year-old captured an unprecedented 10th Roland Garros title in sensational style on Sunday, thrashing Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka in the final after a faultless fortnight in Paris. It maintained a return to form and fitness for the Spaniard who also reached the Australian Open final at the start of the year and who climbed to number two in the rankings on Monday â his highest mark since 2014, since when he has often been battling injuries. Inevitably thoughts are already turning to Wimbledon and the prospect of Nadal repeating his 2008 and 2010 victories â both of which followed hot on the heels of winning French titles without dropping a set as he did this year. Nadal, never one to fuel the hype, warned against installing him as a favorite on the Wimbledon lawns where he has also lost three finals; especially as his recent record there is dismal.  Since I have had problems with my knee, since 2012, playing on grass has been very complicated for me,  Nadal, who lost only 35 games at Roland Garros to become the first player to win the same grand slam title 10 times in the professional era, said.  We'll see how my knee behaves. Playing on grass is very special. You need to play at a lower level. The body posture is down. You have less stability.  But keep in mind I played five finals in Wimbledon. I like playing on grass. On grass, anything can happen. I'm motivated.  After steamrolling through the European claycourt season, compiling a win-loss record of 24-1 with titles in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Madrid before regaining his French Open crown, Nadal will spend a few days relaxing at home in Mallorca before playing in the Wimbledon warm-up at Queen's Club. After weeks spent on the bouncy red clay, it is a tough transition and Nadal is well aware of the dangers having suffered early defeats at Wimbledon to the likes of outsiders such as Steve Darcis, Lukas Rosol and Dustin Brown. Since losing in the 2011 final to Novak Djokovic he has not gone beyond round four while last year he could not play because of the left wrist injury that curtailed his French Open. He also pulled out in 2009 when his creaking knee prevented him from trying to defend his title.  I could win the first two matches and then things could change,  Nadal, whose first grand slam title for three years took his total to 15, said.  The fact is that the two first matches could be very dangerous.  I need to feel strong, low, and have powerful legs to play well in Wimbledon. If I have pain in the knees then I know from experience that it's almost impossible. If I am healthy and I am able to have the right preparation I'll have my chances. Nadal's incredible form - he is 43-6 so far this season - means there is also the strong possibility of overhauling Andy Murray and ending the year as world number one for the first time since 2013.  Winning these kind of titles, then you have chances to become any number on the ranking. I don't know. I am playing well. If I am able to keep playing well, why not?  he said.  I am right now seeded No. 2. We will see what happens during the rest of the year. It really depends on me.

MMI, the No. 3 long-term insurer in South Africa, has seen profits drop for the past two years as weak growth and poor investment returns weighed on revenues. The insurer plans to use African Bank to build up a loan book in excess of 10 billion rand ($780 million) over the next five years and to share the profits equally with the bank.  African Bank will be the exclusive provider of consumer credit products to MMI, for solutions falling within its product range,  MMI said, adding that the lender will use the insurer's existing sales channels. African Bank, a lender that grants loans not backed by assets, was rescued and recapitalised by South Africa's central bank after its parent African Bank Investments Limited collapsed in 2014. In April last year, the bank was split into a  good  business aimed at attracting new clients, and a new company to mop up old debts.  African Bank will act as sponsoring bank to facilitate deposit-taking and extend transactional banking capabilities that MMI wishes to offer to its clients,  the insurer said in a statement. MMI also plans to sell to African Bank's clients, making its full range of insurance products available to African Bank account holders, with the goal of generating more than 1 billion rand in premiums within five years.

The digital camera and photocopier maker said it would have to knock 37.5 billion yen ($341 million) off six years' worth of net profit, rather than the 22 billion yen flagged in April. It said a third-party investigation found financial incentives at Fuji Xerox New Zealand encouraged management and staff to book sales earlier than standard practice, artificially bumping up income. It then discovered similar processes at Fuji Xerox Australia, prompting Fujifilm to revise its estimate.  There was poor communication within Fuji Xerox and between Fuji Xerox and Fujifilm,  Fujifilm President Kenji Sukeno said at a news briefing, noting that Fuji Xerox began life as a joint venture and so has traditionally had more independence within the group. While the New Zealand unit accounted for just 0.8 percent of group sales in the year ended March 2016, the revelation it did not follow standard accounting practices has put oversight into the spotlight at a time when Japan's government wants to strengthen corporate governance to attract foreign investors.

At Fujifilm, the accounting fallout sees Chief Executive Officer Shigetaka Komori and Chief Operating Officer Kenji Sukeno taking a 10 percent pay cut for three months, while top executives at subsidiary Fuji Xerox Co Ltd will resign.

Coherus' shares fell nearly 25 percent to $15.50 in trading before the bell. The biosimilar, CHS-1701, is among Redwood City, California-based Coherus' lead experimental drugs. The FDA's response comes as Amgen gears up for biosimilar competition for Neulasta, which generated about $4.6 billion in sales last year. Biosimilars aim to copy biologic products, which are made inside living cells, but they can never be exact duplicates, so biosimilar manufacturers need to conduct clinical trials to show their products work as intended. The FDA requested Coherus for a re-analysis of certain data and asked the drug developer for more manufacturing information, Coherus said, adding that it would work with the agency to address the concerns. Amgen's shares were up about 1 percent at $165.75 in premarket trading.

Local exporters in Vietnam are struggling to find coffee to fulfil their contracts, trade sources said, after farmers sold forward much of the harvest early on in the season when global prices hit their highest in more than five years. The squeeze comes at a time of tight supplies in the country, after a smaller crop this season and heavy rains during harvesting that wreaked havoc on crop quality. Vietnam is the world's top grower of robusta coffee, which is mainly used to produce instant or soluble coffee. The coffee is priced against ICE robusta futures and international trade houses were able buy at a discount of $50 to $70 a tonne when farmers were selling heavily.  The international trade has been stockpiling basically,  said one European trader.  They decided to get long early on.  Local exporters, now unable to get supplies from farmers, have been forced to buy from the international trade houses at premiums of $20 to $30 a tonne, industry sources in Europe and Vietnam estimate. They pegged profits for the international trade houses, who have stored the coffee in their warehouses in Vietnamese ports, at $70 to $100 a tonne.  They used financial leverage to buy at discounts at the beginning of the harvest season,  said Phan Hung Anh, deputy director of Anh Minh Co, a coffee-trading firm in Daklak, Vietnam's largest coffee-growing province.  And now they sell back to companies at premiums.   Vietnamese firms can't do the same because their financial capability and storage don't match those of international trading houses.  Vietnam is expected to produce 26.3 million bags of coffee in the 2016/17 season, down from 28.4 million in the prior season, Rabobank figures show. International traders were holding roughly 6.5 million 60-kg bags (390,000 tonnes) at the end of May, out of about 9 million in stocks in the country, sources estimated. They have sold about 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes to local exporters, Vietnamese traders said. These trades have been painful for local Vietnamese exporters, some of whom sell beans to coffee giants such as Nestle and Jacobs Douwe Egberts. Traders said many had sold coffee far in advance to roasters at much lower prices and are now feeling the pinch of strengthening differentials as they inch towards delivery. The exporters have been left with little choice, however, as farmers sit on their remaining good quality coffee in the hope that prices will climb. Farmers are holding less than 15 percent of the crop at this point in the season, compared to about 35 percent in a typical year, traders estimated. Local exporters could find themselves squeezed further in coming months as supplies continue to dwindle and differentials strengthen before the start of the next harvest in October. There is also a risk international trade houses may stop selling coffee to Vietnamese exporters, as they shift attention to delivering on their own contracts with roasters later in the year.  That tightness is starting to materialise,  said another trader.  And if they turn off the tap, the prices and the differentials will go even higher.

The digital camera and photocopier maker said it would have to knock 37.5 billion yen ($341 million) off six years' worth of net profit, rather than the 22 billion yen flagged in April. It said a third-party investigation found financial incentives at Fuji Xerox New Zealand encouraged management and staff to book sales earlier than standard practice, artificially bumping up income. It then discovered similar processes at Fuji Xerox Australia, prompting Fujifilm to revise its estimate.  There was poor communication within Fuji Xerox and between Fuji Xerox and Fujifilm,  Fujifilm President Kenji Sukeno said at a news briefing, noting that Fuji Xerox began life as a joint venture and so has traditionally had more independence within the group. While the New Zealand unit accounted for just 0.8 percent of group sales in the year ended March 2016, the revelation it did not follow standard accounting practices has put oversight into the spotlight at a time when Japan's government wants to strengthen corporate governance to attract foreign investors.

As former head of LCH, Davie's return reflects the growing importance of the clearing business to the wider exchange group. In addition to running the firm's SwapClear platform for over-the-counter interest rate swaps clearing, Davie will also be responsible for the wider listed rates business. During his 18 months as head of rates services at LSEG, Davie developed the firm's approach to rates products including the launch of listed interest rate derivatives platform, CurveGlobal. Davie will retain his position as chairman of CurveGlobal following his move, which is effective immediately. Portfolio margining between OTC and listed derivatives forms a core part of LCH's strategy and Davie will lead the next phase of the Spider portfolio margining service, which went live May 2016 for short-term contracts. He will also manage other capital optimisation services such as swaps compression. As part of his new role, Davie will be responsible for the development of LCH SwapAgent, which aims to bring efficiency savings to the uncleared bilateral swaps market through greater standardisation and simplification. The appointment sees Davie return to a business where he spent five years in senior positions, including a stint as CEO. In his new role, Davie reports to Daniel Maguire, who was appointed group COO of LCH in April. That is a reversal of three years ago, when Maguire was promoted to global head of SwapClear, reporting to Davie. Following Davie's return, Maguire will relinquish his additional responsibilities as global head of rates and FX for LCH. While Davie takes over the expanded rates activities, Paddy Boyle will continue as global head of the firm's ForexClear platform. In the FX business, LCH expects to launch clearing of FX options towards the end of this year, following an agreement with FX settlement provider CLS.

The index had reached a 15-year high earlier this month and has soared around 40 percent over the last year. The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.6 percent, supported by modest gains in oil prices, which lifted shares in energy stocks, and by first round French parliamentary election results which look set to give President Emmanuel Macron a huge majority to push through pro-business reforms. Italy also offered some support after the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement failed to make the run-off vote in almost all the main cities up for grabs in local elections. Italian government bond yields fell to their lowest since January and Portugal's to nine-month lows , while French bonds closed the gap on Germany.  Macron doing well in the first round of the French parliamentary elections bodes well for him getting a majority,  said Lyn Graham-Taylor, fixed income strategist at Rabobank.  The fact that 5-Star did poorly in local elections in Italy also suggests a setback for populism in Europe.  The euro rose back to $1.1220 in the currency markets, where anticipation is building ahead of Wednesday's conclusion of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting at which the central bank is expected to nudge up U.S. interest rates. But economists will be watching to see whether the recent dip in economic data and uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump has dented confidence. Britain's sterling was in focus again as it slipped back below $1.27 and 88.30 pence per euro as Prime Minister Theresa May attempted to prop up her position after last week's damaging election. A survey from one of the UK's biggest business groups showed confidence had been hit hard by the election ahead of the start of Brexit negotiations with the EU next week.  It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders,  said Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors.  The consequences could â if not addressed immediately â be disastrous for the UK economy.  Feds Up Futures markets pointed to further losses for tech-stocks when Wall Street resumes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was seen down 0.8 percent after an almost 2 percent drop on Friday had consigned it to its third biggest one-day loss of the year. While year-to-date Nasdaq gains of more than 15 percent have outperformed the wider market, the ebbing of the Trump reflation trade and the slide in U.S. economic surprises deep into negative territory, has prompted some strategists and investors to review the mix of their portfolios. The G10 economic surprise index, capturing the worldâs 10 leading economies, has just dipped below zero for the first time in 8 months. JPMorgan, said the âreduced upside risk to growth and inflationâ has led it to underweight growth sensitive stocks and assets in favour of high income plays. It is also feeding into dollar weakness. The greenback was a shade lower at 110.040 yen and the dollar index against a basket of currencies nudged down to 97.118, easing back from a nine-day high hit at the end of last week. In commodities, crude oil prices extended gains after rising on Friday when a pipeline leak in major producer Nigeria overpowered supply worries weighing on the market. U.S. crude and Brent were both more than 1 percent higher at $46.41 and $48.80 a barrel respectively, copper was steady while gold snapped a three-day losing streak to climb to $1,269 an ounce.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties a week ago, accusing Doha of backing terrorism. This has disrupted imports of food and other materials and caused many foreign banks to scale back business with Qatar. But on Monday, it was becoming clear that Qatar could prevent the economic damage from becoming critical. Some of its food factories are working extra shifts to process imports from nations outside the Gulf, such as Brazil, and shipping lines are operating via Oman instead of the UAE. These measures may be inconvenient, involve delays and raise costs for Qatar; on Monday Fitch put Qatar's AA credit rating on Rating Watch Negative, saying a sustained crisis could hurt its credit outlook. But they are unlikely to prevent the economy from functioning in any fundamental way. In the local money market, where Qatari banks have often depended on loans and deposits from foreign banks, local institutions made up liquidity shortfalls by borrowing from the central bank's repo facility, bankers said. In an interview with CNBC television, one of the first public appearances by a Qatari economic policy maker since the crisis erupted, Qatari finance minister Ali Sherif al-Emadi sounded confident. He said the energy sector and economy of the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter were essentially operating as normal and that there had not been a serious impact on supplies of food or other goods. Qatar can import goods from Turkey, the Far East or Europe and will respond to the crisis by diversifying its economy even more, he told CNBC.  Our reserves and investment funds are more than 250 percent of gross domestic product, so I don't think there is any reason that people need to be concerned about what's happening or any speculation on the Qatari riyal.  In the Gulf's tense political climate, many independent analysts in the region decline to discuss Qatar's economy publicly for fear of irritating their governments. But Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at London-based Capital Economics, said that as long as the other Gulf countries did not interfere with Qatar's LNG exports, which would be a major escalation of the crisis, the tiny state would probably be able to carry on without a serious recession.  It seems Qatar would be able to weather quite a prolonged period of sanctions,  he said, adding that economic growth, fuelled by government spending and infrastructure projects, was  highly unlikely to grind to halt . Markets Qatar's riyal currency, pegged at 3.64 to the U.S. dollar, was under pressure last week as banks reacted nervously to the diplomatic rift. On Monday, the currency came off last week's lows in the spot and offshore forwards markets. Bankers said the central bank, which has $34.5 billion of net foreign reserves, backed by an estimated hundreds of billions of dollars of assets in Doha's sovereign wealth fund, was supplying enough dollars to the spot market to keep exchange rates under control. The cost of insuring Qatar's sovereign debt against default fell back for the first time in a week, while yields on Doha's international bonds dropped almost 10 basis points and the stock market stabilised after sliding 8.7 percent in the past week. One result of the sanctions has been a severe shortage of U.S. dollar cash at Qatar's money changers; supplies used to be flown in from the UAE but that route is closed. The shortage persisted on Monday although some dealers said efforts were underway to obtain supplies from elsewhere, such as Hong Kong. Tuvey said the main threat to the economy was that Qatari banks could find it much harder to obtain wholesale funding from other banks to sustain growth in their loan portfolios. This could force them to call in loans, hurting the economy. However, if the situation becomes critical, the Qatari government can liquidate some of its overseas assets and provide the funds to its banking system, much as Saudi Arabia did last year when its banks faced a funding squeeze due to low oil prices, he said. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund has major stakes in top Western companies such as Credit Suisse. Asked by CNBC whether it might now sell some of these stakes to raise money, Emadi indicated this was not on the cards at present.  We are extremely comfortable with our positions, our investments and liquidity in our systems,  he said.

The European Union's executive European Commission is due to publish a draft law on Tuesday on how the clearing of euro denominated financial instruments should be handled after Brexit. Clearing stands between two sides of a transaction to ensure its safe and smooth completion. The London Stock Exchange's subsidiary LCH currently clears the bulk of euro-denominated swaps, a derivative contract that helps companies guard against unexpected moves in interest rates or currencies. Britain, however, is due to leave the bloc in 2019, putting it out of the EU's regulatory reach. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), one of the world's top derivatives industry bodies, said on Monday that a  relocation  in euro clearing to continental Europe would split liquidity in markets and reduce the ability of banks to save on margin by offsetting positions in the same liquidity pool. That would lead to an increase of 15 to 20 percent in initial margin or cash that is set aside against a trade in case of a default, it said.  Many of the detrimental consequences ... will be felt most keenly by banks' clients,  ISDA Chief Executive Scott O'Malia said in a letter to the European commissioner in charge of financial services, Valdis Dombrovskis.  A relocation policy is also likely to heighten financial stability concerns.  The focus should be on  appropriate arrangements  for oversight and cooperation in respect to UK-based clearing houses, ISDA said. The EU has said that one option is to have direct supervision of a clearing house in London. Last week another industry body, the Futures Industry Association, said relocation would nearly double the amount of margin that would be needed, to $160 billion from $83 billion currently. However, Frankfurt-based Eurex Clearing, which could benefit from any relocation, has indicated that extra margin costs would be far lower in practice.

Group of Seven (G7) environment ministers and officials are meeting in Bologna on Sunday and Monday to discuss issues ranging from climate change to sustainable development and litter at sea. But earlier this month U.S. President Donald Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, drawing condemnation from other world leaders.  Positions over the Paris accord are far apart ... and will remain that way,  Italian Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti said on the sidelines of the meeting.  Italy holds the G7 presidency for 2017. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni have said the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, urging their allies to speed up efforts to combat global warming. German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said all seven countries had agreed on the need to take action but disappointment had been expressed at the U.S. decision to leave the Paris Accord.  There will be a final comuniquÃ© tomorrow that will differentiate opinions,  she said, without providing details. Trump has said the Paris accord would undermine the U.S. economy, cost jobs, and put the country at a permanent disadvantage compared with its competitors. Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, attended the morning meeting in Bologna but flew back to the United States on Sunday evening to attend Trump's first full cabinet meeting scheduled for Monday.

I believe engaging in international discussion is of the utmost importance to the United States when it comes to environmental issues,  he said in the statement. According to Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Pruitt told delegates in the opening session that the United States wanted to continue making efforts in combating climate change. Slideshow (2 Images) He also mentioned he wants to engage with the (UN's) Climate Change secretariat,  she said. Trump said when he announced he was pulling out of the Paris accord that his administration would begin negotiations either to re-enter the deal or set up a new agreement on  terms that are fair to the United States . Italy's Galletti said the United States was looking to take the climate change debate forward on a voluntary basis while Paris was a multilateral accord requiring monitoring, deadlines and transparency.  That's a substantial difference,  he said. The United States is the world's second biggest carbon emitter behind China. United Nations executive director for the environment Erik Solheim, present at the morning sessions, said G7 countries, excluding the United States were absolutely committed to move ahead with climate action whatever happened in the White House.  We cannot allow one nation to derail what 190 other nations are happy to do,  he said. Editing by Gavin Jones, Greg Mahlich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-environment-idUSKBN1920N8"},

The UK online supermarket will meet investors over two-day meetings from Tuesday June 13 for a senior secured Â£200m seven-year non-call three-year deal. The announcement for the UK household name has already caught the market's attention.  We'll definitely be looking at this one,  one high-yield trader said.  It's an interesting and well-known name and it will be firmly on our radar. I expect it will go down well.  Ocado was established in the UK over 16 years ago when it entered its first branding and sourcing agreement with Waitrose. It listed on the London Stock Exchange in July 2010. It is now expanding its presence into Europe, having announced its first non-UK partnership with a European regional retailer in early June. Ocado also beefed up its regional presence when it signed a 25-year agreement with British supermarket Morrisons in May 2013 to provide technology, logistics and distribution services.  The board believes that with its continued strong trading, increased scale and profitability, Ocado can benefit from the historically low financing costs in the public debt markets to put in place longer maturity financing on attractive terms,  the company said in a statement. Ocado aims to extend its debt maturity profile and diversify its sources of funding but first will have to sell its credit story to bond investors.  The stock market has already differentiated Ocado and said you're not just a retailer, but also a tech company, and has priced them at a certain price,  a lead on the deal said.  It will be interesting to see if the debt market will buy into that. That's the difference between pricing like that, or at a premium to Tesco and Iceland.   Or, does the high-yield market say, the tech side of it is an equity story but the credit story is just a food retail business?  Investors nonetheless are rubbing their hands at the prospect of a well-known Double B name offering some yield.  The problem with Ocado will be that it's a small - and potentially attractive - issue meaning that we most probably won't get any allocation as is usually the case for small hedge funds like us,  a hedge fund analyst said. Ocado holds an expected Ba3 (Moody's)/BB (Fitch) rating. The company said in an offering memorandum sent to investors on Monday that its objective was to maintain 'an appropriate balance of debt and equity financing'. Ocado's net assets at the end of the period were Â£218.2m, from Â£202.4m in 2013, while its net debt stands at Â£99.4m up from Â£50.9m in 2013. The group's Ebitda was Â£37.6m at the end of April this year, up from Â£31.2m for the same period in 2016. Global coordinators are Barclays and HSBC, and joint bookrunners are Goldman, NatWest Markets and Rabobank. The London roadshow will kick off on Tuesday at 8:30 UK time at Innholders Hall for breakfast meetings and one to ones, and will move to the Lanesborough on Wednesday, also for breakfast meetings and one to ones.

I wasn't surprised to hear about the recession. I saw that the economy was going down last year,  said 38-year old Setlhabi, staring at shelves piled high with clothes offered at discount prices.  People don't have money and for those who come in, they buy cheaper items and not the expensive ones.  South Africa sank into recession for the first time in eight years in the first quarter, hit by weakness in consumer sectors such as wholesale, retail and accommodation. The economic turmoil is piling pressure on President Jacob Zuma, who faces calls to step down from within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) as a string of corruption scandals, party infighting and sky-high unemployment erode public support ahead of elections in 2019. The persistence of poverty and joblessness 23 years after the end of apartheid is also stoking anger, with unrest dubbed  service delivery protests  -- taking place frequently. Unemployment is at a 14-year high of 27.7 percent. The government's response to the gradually building economic crisis is due to be laid out later this week when Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba briefs the media how he will address the economic challenges. Economists had expected the economy to expand, helped by a recovery in mining and agriculture, but surprise contractions in the rest of the economy led it to shrink. Rising unemployment, high interest rates and a drop in purchasing power after a drought last year have all driven consumer prices up and hammered consumer confidence.  I used to go into a shop and fill a trolley with groceries to last my family a month but that's not happening anymore,  said 68-year old Mabule Modiba, a retired salesman who recently started driving a taxi to make ends meet.  I thought I was done working, but now I also have to look after my grandchildren because my kids don't have jobs.  South Africa's inflation rose to 7 percent early 2016, breaching the central bank's target of 3-6 percent, but has now eased to 5.3 percent as food price rises slow. The Treasury has said the recession introduced  significant downward bias  to this year's growth estimate of 1.3 percent, up from 0.3 percent in 2016. It means growth is more likely to fall than rise. It also said that any policies introduced to combat the recession would be made within the current budget framework, in which South Africa aims to cut its budget deficit to 3.3 percent of national output in the next three years from the current 3.8 percent. Zuma's Promise To stem falling voter support for the ANC, Zuma has vowed to redistribute economic wealth to the poor, but this will be almost impossible with an economy contracting. The ANC lost major cities in its worst ever local election results last year and opposition parties are becoming increasingly confident of ousting the party of Nelson Mandela at a parliamentary vote in 2019.  What (the recession) does do is show what is at stake,  Nomura analyst Peter Attard Montalto said.  If there canât be reform, we are on this path where the ANC will lose power because they cannot create jobs.  Unbridled lending fuelled a consumer frenzy that helped the South African economy grow by an average 5 percent a year in the five years before the 2009 recession. But stricter lending rules since 2015, which require borrowers to produce bank statements and proof of income before retailers can grant them in-store credit accounts, have excluded some from buying on credit. Results from clothing and furniture retailers such as Mr Price, Truworths and The Foschini Group show they have lost a combined total of 1 billion rand ($78 million) in sales since new rules were implemented. Active credit accounts fell to 54 million in the first three months of the year, from a high of nearly 58 million in 2015.  Consumers had to become conservative and try to live within their means, given the high risk that the economic environment could deteriorate further,  said Elize Kruger, an economist at NKC African Economics. There is no relief in sight for traders like Setlhabi after a central bank official said cutting interest rates was not the answer to dragging South Africa out of recession.  I don't see myself surviving if the economy doesn't pick up,  Setlhabi said.  If nothing changes in the next two to three years, then I will have to sell the shop.  $1 = 12.8976 rand Additional reporting by TJ Strydom and Olwethu Boso; Editing by Joe Brock/Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/safrica-economy-idUSL8N1IZ50X"},

In the legal action, filed in London's High Court, Natixis said it would seek damages from Marex because the bank provided finance based on fake receipts in a deal arranged by the broker. Marex rejected the claim and said it had issued a counterclaim against Glencore unit Access World because the warehouse operator had verified the receipts as being authentic.  We vigorously contest Natixis' claim,  Marex said in a statement.  Access World needs to explain how receipts that it had authenticated were subsequently cancelled.  Natixis acknowledged it had filed a lawsuit against Marex but declined to make any further comment. Access World's owner Glencore declined to comment.  Access World said on Jan. 21 that it has become aware of fake warehouse receipts circulating in its name and urged holders to seek authentication.  The legal action revolves around three trades in nickel warehouse receipts in late 2016 and early 2017.  Marex said it had the receipts authenticated by Access World and also had the physical metal inspected by Alfred H. Knight, an specialist metals inspection firm.  Alfred H. Knight did not reply to requests for comment. Marex said the fraud was uncovered when it sought to verify a fourth trade and Access World said the receipts were fraudulent as well as the previous receipts from the other three trades.    The $30 million of receipts in Natixis' claim represents the full extent of Marex's involvement in the receipts business.  If there is any larger fraud, it involves other market participants and not Marex Spectron,  Marex said. Metals markets were rocked about three years ago by a $3 billion fraud at Qingdao port in China, when a firm allegedly duplicated warehouse certificates to pledge metal as collateral for multiple bank loans.

By Timothy Mclaughlin ELK POINT, S.D., June 9 (Reuters) - In this rural outpost of just over 1,900 residents, a local college student has become a courtroom sketch artist, trailers on Main Street are ersatz offices for a major law firm and members of an agricultural youth club are puzzled by a new  metal detector at the local courthouse. The changes are part of Elk Point's selection as site of a multibillion-dollar defamation case pitting ABC News against South Dakota-meat processor, Beef Products Inc. The company contends that ABC and reporter Jim Avila defamed it by referring to its signature product as  pink slime  in 2012 broadcasts. BPI calls its product lean finely textured beef (LFTB). The trial, scheduled to run eight weeks, opened on Monday. ABC is a unit of Walt Disney Co. While BPI could face an uphill battle to show ABC intended to harm the company or knew its reporting was false, as required to prove a defamation claim, several Elk Point residents interviewed by Reuters this week were sympathetic to BPI and its founder, Eldon Roth.  I used his products and they were good products,  said one longtime resident, Jim Cody, referring to Roth.  I couldn't believe that people were saying this crap about them.  Mark Turner, who owns LandMark Antiques & More, sells his own beef out of a small refrigerator in the shop. BPI is an industrialized meat processor with which he has little in common, Turner said. Even so, he felt ABC unfairly depicted LFTB. Others, like Bobbye Wendt, who was hoping the trial would bring a boost in business for her coffee shop, were torn. ABC  could have just been reporting,  she said. During jury selection last week a handful of potential jurors were dismissed because of criticisms of LFTB, BPI or the company founders, the Sioux City Journal reported. The company's headquarters are not in Elk Point but some 20 miles (32 km) away. Dane Butswinkas, an attorney for ABC, acknowledged the broadcasting company has no local ties during Monday's opening statements, but asked that jurors look beyond this and examine the facts. ABC maintains its reporting was fair and accurate.  No one that I will put on the stand is from here,  he said.  We're all outsiders,  BPI has claimed up to $1.9 billion of damages, which could be tripled to $5.7 billion. The local newspaper, the Southern Union County Leader-Courier, has dubbed it  the trial of a lifetime.  BPI has moved four modular offices into town and purchased another building. ABC is renting Cody's Homestead, Jim Cody's shuttered, sun-faded steakhouse, the Leader-Courier reported. ABC declined to comment on the property. While the trial has not caused a traffic jam on Main Street as some had predicted, the Union County Courthouse was unusually busy this week. A parade of public relations staff, company officials and lawyers wheeled dozens of boxes of files under the court's mounted elk head after making the 30-minute drive from hotels in Sioux City, Iowa. Elk Point has only one hotel. On Tuesday, children sheepishly asked a security guard at the courthouse if they needed to walk through the new metal detector to drop off their farm club paperwork. They did not, he said. (Editing by David Greising and Matthew Lewis)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/abc-pinkslime-town-idUSL1N1J626Q"},

The DNB in January had forecast 2.3 percent growth in 2017. The fifth-largest economy in the euro zone will maintain  strong momentum  in the coming years, but a slowing of world trade and the housing market in the Netherlands will ease the pace of expansion to around 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, it said. Unemployment in the Netherlands, one of the top economic performers in the euro zone, will drop to its lowest level since 2010 this year at 5 percent and will continue declining in the coming years, putting upward pressure on wages. Higher income and rising house prices will further stimulate consumer spending, while inflation will remain modest, with projected rates of just over 1 percent until 2019. Investments by companies, meanwhile, will reach the highest level in 40 years, measured as a share of GDP, helped by profit growth and easing financial constraints. Although domestic spending has played a significant part in the recovery of the Dutch economy after the financial crisis, exports will contribute almost half of total GDP growth in 2017. The DNB warned that a rising wave of trade protectionism globally could pose a serious threat to the relatively small and open economy of the Netherlands. Trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other countries could potentially reduce Dutch economic growth to slightly above 1.5 percent in 2018-2019, it said.

The U.S. Commerce Department's regulations  hit list  recommendations follow more than three months of study and consultation with industry on ways to streamline regulations and ease burdens on manufacturing firms. A Trump administration official with knowledge of the recommendations to be sent to the White House said the Environmental Protection Agency's complex permitting rules will be a key focus, echoing comments to Reuters by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month. The 171 public comments submitted by companies and industry groups offer a strong hint to priorities for Commerce's streamlining efforts, with numerous industry groups and firms complaining that EPA air quality permit rules for new facilities are often redundant. The report will analyze the submissions and  will identify a lot of problems and lay out ways to take responsible actions,  saidd the official, who declined to be identified by name. The process has looked at many regulations finalized under Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama. A common demand from industry was that the Trump administration should reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards, with several groups arguing this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for new facilities, raising costs. 3M Co said other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act contained  overlapping rules, redundant requirements, conflicts between rules and undue complexity.  The National Association of Manufacturers said the EPA's review requirements for new sources of emissions such as factories can add $100,000 in costs for modeling air quality to a new facility and delay factory expansions by 18 months. It added that EPA should find ways to ease burdens for smaller projects and smaller firms. Also drawing complaints from construction groups and iron foundries is an incoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule reducing by 80 percent the amount of crystalline silica dust that can be inhaled. The dust, common on construction sites, can cause lung cancer, according to OSHA, but industry groups say reducing it to those levels will be prohibitively expensive.  To meet these much lower levels, new engineering controls and other measures will become necessary within the roofing industry,  said the National Roofing Contractors Association. Trump has already taken steps to roll back some not fully completed Obama-era environmental regulations such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants and a clean water rule greatly restricting runoff into small streams. But the Commerce list may target some rules already on the books.  We are at the outset of what we think will be a very intense deregulatory agenda from the Trump team,  said Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group.  We are concerned that they are looking to gut regulations that benefit workers and benefit consumers.  Another OSHA rule that drew industry complaints is one that further reduces worker exposure to beryllium, another potential carcinogen, that became effective on May 20 after a decade-long rulemaking effort. Manufacturing groups including auto parts makers have also targeted labor rules that make it easier for unions to organize workers, expand the number of employees eligible for overtime and govern the reporting of workplace injuries. The range of industry complaints is vast. Mining giant Freeport-McMoRan argued that planned EPA financial responsibility requirements for hard rock mining operations costing billions of dollars were based on inadequate study and  will have disastrous consequences for the mining industry.  Guitar maker Taylor Guitars said that permits needed from the Fish and Wildlife Service for mother-of-pearl used to decorate instruments was unnecessarily raising its costs.  This declaration requirement does not seem to serve any conservation or other purpose. The shell is not a species that is protected under law,  the company said.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can't get from sitting in an office.  This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,  the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters. His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2s8LJrm) Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research's HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index's 3.3 percent return over the same period. It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden's clients. Golden is known for the time he takes â sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble. He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.  Mitch hustles hard to know who's out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn't ready to invest immediately,  said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters' portfolio for a decade. To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.  We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,  Golden said.  It is a very subtle balance.  Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis.  For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.  The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a  Kabuki dance  in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots. Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management. Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam's biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company. Playground Chats On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides. Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period. In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhornâs Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds. He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill's $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August's $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden's top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each. Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates' early dramatic gains.  That can be very costly,  he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed. Greenlight Masters is Einhorn's brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings. Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013. After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a  D-meet  with Einhorn at Greenlight's midtown Manhattan offices.  It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,  he said.

Under the draft rules published on the website of the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS), foreign investors targeting China's bond market under the connection would be required to submit quotation requests of a minimum 1 million yuan ($147,100). CFETS said it would have the right to investigate investors whose trading or information disclosure violate its rules or the rules of China's interbank bond market.  Abnormal  trading activities by investors, including insider trading, market manipulation and frequently sending quotations not reflecting  true trading intentions  could result in investors' trading rights being suspended or revoked, the draft rules said. China's bond market was worth 66.9 trillion yuan, or about $9.8 trillion, at the end of April, according to the People's Bank of China (PBOC). The  Bond Connect  programme has been planned in the wake of a scheme launched in 2014 that allows two-way trading between the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets.

In May, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's bond market regulator, and the PBOC announced that the programme had been formally approved, but that it would only feature  Northbound  trade in its initial stage.

Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the two main futures and options contracts linked to Henry Hub prices by 765 billion cubic feet in the week to June 6. Fund managers cut their net long position by a total of 1,349 billion cubic feet over the two weeks since May 23, after boosting positions by 1,721 billion cubic feet over the previous 12 weeks (tmsnrt.rs/2rRAYZa). By May 23, hedge funds had accumulated a near-record net long position of 3,919 billion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (tmsnrt.rs/2sTeDch). Fund managers had the biggest bullish bias on record, with more than five long positions for every short position (tmsnrt.rs/2rmwMwV). But the concentration of hedge fund long positions left prices looking stretched and vulnerable to a correction. Fund managers gambled that strong exports coupled with a new wave of combined-cycle power plants would tighten gas stocks this summer. But instead stocks have risen in line with the normal seasonal pattern as power producers have switched back to burning coal. With ample stocks, the bullish bias among the hedge fund managers was no longer sustainable and a correction became inevitable. Turning Point Spot prices and calendar spreads peaked in the middle of May, and started to soften gradually, before tumbling after May 22. Gentle liquidation of long positions by former hedge fund bulls has been accelerated by a new wave of short selling from hedge fund bears anticipating a price correction. Hedge fund long positions were reduced by 453 billion cubic feet over the two weeks ending on June 6, but fund managers also established 896 billion cubic feet of new short positions. Gas prices have fallen sharply to encourage electricity generators to run their gas-fired power plants for more hours and ease back on coal burning. Nearly all the decline in prices has been concentrated in near-dated futures contracts to encourage maximum power burn this summer. The price of gas for delivery at Henry Hub in July 2017 has fallen by more than 40 cents per million British thermal units, around 12 percent, since May 22 (tmsnrt.rs/2rRvNIz). By contrast, there has been little change in forward prices, with the price of gas for delivered in July 2018 down by just 2 cents since May 22. Calendar spreads have collapsed, with the backwardation from July 2017 to July 2018 easing from 47 cents on May 22 to just 9 cents on June 12 (tmsnrt.rs/2rmq3mx). The sharp reduction in hedge fund long positions and establishment of a significant number of new short ones has left the risks around gas prices looking much more balanced. Gas prices are now much more competitive with coal, which should encourage power producers to run their combined-cycle units for more hours as baseload and limit further downside risks.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Smart Cities Mission aims to modernise 100 cities by 2020 with high-speed internet, uninterrupted power and water supply, efficient public transport and living standards comparable to Europe. But the $7.5 billion plan does not address the needs and rights of poor women and marginalised groups including minorities and migrants, according to a report by New Delhi-based advocacy group Housing and Land Rights Network, India (HLRN). Nearly 14 million households live in urban slums across India, with a further 3 million living on city streets. The drive for Smart Cities has already triggered evictions of people from slums and informal settlements in cities including Indore, Bhubaneswar, Delhi and Kochi without adequate compensation or alternate accommodation. Plans to spruce up central business districts and build urban rail lines are likely to displace tens of thousands more, the report said.  The premise of the 'smart city' as a relevant model needs a fundamental re-evaluation, given the increasing levels of exclusion, impoverishment, unemployment, homelessness, forced evictions and displacement of the urban poor in our cities,  said Shivani Chaudhry, executive director at HLRN. Officials say India's congested cities - 13 of which are among the 20 most polluted in the world - desperately need a makeover to improve residents' quality of life.  The mission provides the choice to those who live in squalor to live with dignity, in a more hospitable environment with basic infrastructure,  said A. A. Rao, a spokesman for the housing ministry which is overseeing the plan.  In every instance, people are taken on board, and there have been no forced evictions to my knowledge,  he said. About a third of India's population of 1.25 billion lives in cities, with tens of thousands leaving their villages for cities every year in search of better opportunities. The Smart Cities plan promotes urbanisation without addressing the reasons people move to cities, such as a lack of jobs in rural areas, Chaudhry said. The government must adopt a more holistic approach to improve social services and infrastructure across the country, and undertake human rights and environmental impact assessments for every Smart City project, she said.  Merely selecting some cities, and some areas within cities excludes rural areas, which intensifies the justification for urbanisation and worsens the rural-urban divide,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  There is no place for the poor in these shiny cities envisioned by the government.  Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran, Editing by Alisa Tang.

EU officials have set out procedures for determining the new locations for the agencies via a stepped voting system. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said it was unclear when the remaining 27 EU members would decide on a joint position on the regulators, but Berlin was aiming for a deal at the EU summit later this month. According to an EU paper, member states will be asked to decide on new homes for EMA and EBA by October 2017. The voting process will start with a verdict on the EMA, the larger of the two bodies, and the country selected for this body will not be able to host the banking watchdog as well. Countries have until July 31 to submit bids for both agencies and the voting session will take place on the sidelines of a meeting of European affairs ministers in October, according the 18-page May 19 paper seen by Reuters.

The Rating Outlook on Intrum's expected Long-Term IDR is Positive. The expected ratings will convert to final ratings upon finalisation of the combination of Intrum with another credit management services provider/debt purchaser Lindorff Group (Lindorff), provided that this is undertaken in a manner consistent with Fitch's expectations, as outlined below. They assume remedies needed to address the European Commission (EC) Directorate-General for Competition's requirements are broadly in line with Intrum's proposals. On completion of the transaction, Intrum will acquire all outstanding shares in Lindorff in exchange for newly issued shares in Intrum. Pre-transaction Intrum shareholders will own slightly more than half of the post-transaction share capital, but Nordic Capital Fund VIII, currently the indirect majority shareholder in Lindorff, will become the largest indirect shareholder in the combined entity. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT Intrum's expected ratings reflect the combined company's well-established and diversified franchise within the credit management/debt purchaser sector. Once the Lindorff transaction is completed, expected later this month, Intrum will in Europe be materially the largest in its sector as measured by EBITDA. More than half of its revenue will relate to servicing as opposed to purchasing activities. While Intrum's business model remains focussed on the narrow debt purchasing and collection markets, its broad-based franchise within these industries supports our assessment of Intrum's company profile, which has a positive influence on its expected ratings overall. Since the Lindorff combination was announced, the EC has informed the two parties of potential competition concerns in five Nordic/Baltic markets. Intrum has proposed to divest of Lindorff's business in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden, as well as its own in Norway. According to Intrum, this action will reduce pro-forma EBITDA (excluding the impact of portfolio amortisation, synergies and non-recurring items) by an estimated 12%-13% from its previous level of around SEK5 billion, but maintain the larger of the combining group's two pre-transaction operations in each market. Given continuing leading market share within each of the five affected countries, as well as the breadth of the group's coverage across Europe as a whole, Fitch continues to view Intrum's franchise positively for the expected ratings. The expected Long-Term IDR also takes into account Intrum's leverage (as measured by gross debt/EBITDA), which has a high influence on the expected ratings. On Fitch's calculations (pro-forma for the merger at end-2016, adding back portfolio amortisation, prior to proposed divestments) this would be elevated post transaction-closing at around 4.1x. This would equate to a quantitative benchmark score for leverage in the 'b' category range under Fitch's Global Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria and therefore represents a constraint on Intrum's expected Long-Term IDR and senior debt ratings. Fitch expects only a marginal increase in the calculated leverage figure from the net effect of the EC-mandated divestments, as currently proposed, although sale proceeds could also be used to pay down debt. Fitch regards Intrum's risk controls (based on a three lines-of-defence model) as good, and the combined group demonstrates a track record in adequately pricing asset purchases. Asset quality is driven by the accuracy of Intrum's pricing models and strength of the company's collection activities, both of which Fitch views as being in line with industry practice for the debt purchasing segment of the wider finance company sector. While execution risk exists on the acquisition and integration of Lindorff, Fitch views it as manageable given both companies' significant M&A; experience and the similarities in risk governance between the two institutions. Intrum's profitability benefits from recurring cash flows within the company's core businesses and an EBITDA margin, which remains wide after excluding portfolio amortisation as non-margin revenue. Pre-tax return on average assets will fall sharply following the merger, in part reflecting the additional interest expense burden associated with Lindorff's higher leverage, but profitability will still be a rating strength. Compared with smaller debt purchasers, profitability also has the advantage of considerable geographic and product diversification. While - similar to peers - Intrum's collection time horizon is long (up to 180 months), forecasted collections are skewed towards the first 84 months. This reflects Intrum's focus on smaller ticket unsecured receivables and improves the predictability and accuracy of its estimated remaining collections. However, revenues are concentrated by activity given strong correlation between offering debt purchasing and debt collection activities. The expected ratings also reflect Intrum's reliance on wholesale funding sources, partially offset by the diversity and generally stable nature of such sources. Intrum has signed a commitment letter with a banking consortium enabling the refinancing of Lindorff's financial debt in connection with the merger. The commitment includes both a five-year EUR3 billion bridge financing facility and a EUR1.1 billion revolving credit facility. Fitch regards the revolving credit facility as sufficient to support the merged group's near-term liquidity, while also allowing for portfolio investment opportunities. Interest coverage (EBITDA/interest expense) is adequate and in line with Intrum's expected Long-Term IDR. The Positive Outlook on the expected Long-Term IDR principally reflects Fitch's expectation that leverage will fall in the short-to-medium term post transaction, in accordance with the business plan set out by management. The expected rating assigned to Intrum's senior unsecured debt reflects Fitch's view of average recovery prospects for the debt class in the event of default. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDR AND SENIOR DEBT Assuming Intrum's expected ratings convert to final ratings, a sustained reduction of Intrum's cash flow leverage resulting in a gross debt/EBITDA ratio well within Fitch's 'bb' category quantitative benchmark range for leverage (2.5x to 3.5x), could trigger an upgrade of Intrum's Long-Term IDR and senior debt ratings, assuming other key rating drivers, notably Intrum's franchise, remain unchanged (or improve). Conversely, a delay in reducing cash flow leverage in line with current management forecasts could lead to a revision of the Rating Outlook to Stable from Positive. Indication that revenue attrition would be higher than currently expected, or an inability to realise anticipated cost synergies within the current indicated timeframe, could also lead to a revision of the Rating Outlook to Stable from Positive. While the Positive Outlook means a downgrade is not anticipated, Intrum's Long-Term IDR and senior debt ratings could be downgraded if leverage weakens or an inability to address EC disposal requirements affects Intrum's business model. Intrum's Short-Term IDR would only change if the company's Long-Term IDR is upgraded to 'BBB-' or higher or downgraded below 'B-'. Intrum's senior unsecured debt rating is primarily sensitive to changes in Intrum's Long-Term IDR. Changes in Intrum's debt structure (e.g. a materially larger revolving credit facility which ranks senior to senior unsecured debt) affecting our assessment of recovery prospects for senior unsecured debt in a default scenario could also affect the expected bond rating and result in the unsecured debt being notched below the IDR.

Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Fitch adds amortisation of purchased debt to net revenues to arrive at gross revenues, including it in depreciation and amortisation, but our assessment of EBITDA margin as one measure of profitability nets down for the effect of portfolio amortisation.

With the Fed widely expected to raise interest rates at its two-day meeting that ends on Wednesday, investors will be focussing on whether the central bank thinks the U.S. economy is robust enough to withstand further rate hikes through 2017, and how it plans to whittle down its massive balance sheet.       A 25 basis point rate hike is assumed to be a done deal for the June FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee); with interest rate markets ascribing over 90 percent probability,  Mizuho Bank said in a note.      This means a 25 basis point hike is baked into market (prices), and so failure to yank the trigger will result in a dovish knee-jerk reaction, but this is the outside risk.      MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , however, was down 0.8 percent as the region's technology heavyweights were knocked lower by a slide in U.S. tech shares.     Vietnam's benchmark index snapped two sessions of declines to end higher, underpinned by FLC Faros Construction , which closed 6.9 percent higher, notching its highest percentage gain in more than three months.     FLC Group, whose chairman holds a majority stake in FLC Faro Construction, said it is working with Airbus  to lease about seven aircraft by 2018. FLC Group aims to start a new airline that could take to the skies for the first time early next year.

Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 0.3 percent by 1000 GMT, with investors dumping tech and other cyclical stocks, which feature heavily on the blue-chip index, and heading into defensive sectors. Software company Micro Focus and accounting platform provider Sage Group were the biggest blue-chip fallers, taken down by a pan-European tech sector set for its worst day since the post-Brexit sell-off a year ago. Anti-virus provider Sophos, which had been a top gainer after a ransomware virus spread across the world, fell 5.1 percent on the mid-cap index. Polar Capital Technology Trust fell 4.4 percent on the mid-caps, while Allianz's technology investment trust was the worst small-cap faller, down 4.6 percent. The declines came after a sharp tech sector sell-off on Wall street on Friday - Apple shares had their worst day in more than a year as Goldman Sachs put out a note urging caution across the sector.  Overvaluations of technology companies today resemble previous investment manias,  said Fergus Shaw, fund manager at Cerno Capital.  The fact that even successful businesses can become caught in a mania is evident in the case of Vodafone when its shares peaked at over 4 pounds in 2000, but are just 2 pounds today.   During this initial tech boom, Sage shares also hit a high at 8 pounds, yet despite the increased profits and dividends since, the share price is now 6.70 pounds.   Tech stocks aside, the broad-based dip took down a mixed bag of stocks, reflecting a downbeat day across European benchmarks, with the STOXX 600 down 0.8 percent. Brokers' greater caution on cyclicals, advocating a move towards more defensive sectors, was reflected in the FTSE's moves. Miners Antofagasta, Fresnillo and BHP Billiton were some of the top weights, while defensive stocks Reckitt Benckiser, BT and Vodafone were among the top gainers. A rare bright spot was the energy sector, with oil firms Royal Dutch Shell and BP up as oil prices gained with traders betting the crude market has bottomed. Mitie hit a one-year high, up 9.2 percent after the contractor swung to a full-year operating loss after restating its accounts. Its cost-cutting programme and outlook were well received by investors.  Completed accounting review is providing Mitie with a base from which to build after a tumultuous 12 months,  said Stifel analysts, praising the 45 million pound cost efficiency programme Mitie launched. Liberum upped the stock from  sell  to  hold . Meanwhile, shares in Acacia Mining fell 7 percent after Tanzanian media reported a government investigation team had accused the company of operating in the country illegally.

Last week, European authorities orchestrated a rescue of Spain's Banco Popular, a move that resulted in heavy losses for shareholders and some bond investors. That in turn prompted a steep fall in the share price of a small Spanish lender, Liberbank, wiping almost half of the bank's market value. On Monday morning, Spanish stock market regulator CNMV said it would ban short selling in Liberbank stock for one month. A CNMV official said it wanted to avoid any loss of confidence in Liberbank and that the regulator was not considering extending the ban to other lenders for now. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) also issued a detailed statement that backed the move, explaining the urgent circumstances that led to it. ESMA said that the step had been needed, in the eyes of Spanish authorities, to tackle the threat to market confidence that  could have further implications in terms of financial stability in Spain  following the 'demise' of Banco Popular.  Due to the interconnections and perceived similarities with other entities, the situation could have a domino effect of a size that could become systemic,  ESMA said, warning of a 'contagion' that can hurt the entire financial system. The announcement of the ban led to a rebound in the share price of the lender that was formed in 2011 from the merger of three regional savings banks and which controls around two percent of all Spanish deposits. The stock rebounded more than 20 percent. Its shares were up 28.4 percent at 0.873 euro at 0906 GMT. The Spanish regulator said it would decide later whether or not to extend the ban beyond one month. The CNMV said it had taken this decision after the recent stock price fall of Liberbank in the aftermath of Popular's rescue. But it sought to draw a distiction between the two banks. One official said that Liberbank's situation was different to Popular, whose finances had been stressed. Banco Popular, which had booked revised losses of 3.6 billion euros ($4 billion) in 2016, was rescued after the ECB said there was a deterioration in its liquidity in the days leading to its rescue. The official from the stock market regulator said they had not found any evidence of any liquidity problems at Liberbank. Regulators took the action even though there were few betting on a further fall in the bank's stock. ESMA said that in early June, short positions accounted for around 1.4 percent of its capital.  Without the proposed measure, the threat to market confidence would remain and would be difficult to tackle,  ESMA wrote. Short selling is the sale of a security that is not owned by the seller, or that the seller has borrowed, and motivated by the belief that a security's price will decline, enabling it to be bought back at a lower price to make a profit.

Signs of strong turnout from young voters in Thursday's snap election, which left the ruling Conservative party without a parliamentary majority, could have major repercussions for politics and markets in Britain and possibly beyond, Deutsche analysts Jim Reid and Sukanto Chanda said. They said in a note that young voters making their voices felt suggests economic policy may be more focused on wealth redistribution. At the same time, an unwillingness to alienate older voters means politicians will struggle to tax the old while helping the young.  In short, governments can possibly be forced to spend more across the developed world until bond markets rebel at the high level of debts that this implies and then central banks would be forced to monetise this debt,  Reid and Chanda said in Deutsche Bank's daily fixed income note.  Thursday's election makes helicopter money more likely ... This is different from QE (quantitative easing) as it's central banks buying bonds that are attached to fresh spending rather than independent of it.  Helicopter money is a form of policy easing envisaged by U.S. economist Milton Friedman, using the metaphor of a helicopter dropping money, and has gained attention in recent years as a possible tool to fight deflation. It would be funded by a permanent increase in the money supply, not a temporary boost by bond issues that eventually have to be paid back. The idea of central banks printing money for government spending in a  people's QE  was a prominent part of the 2015 leadership election campaign for British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.

The Financial Stability Committee (KSF) recommended a new rule on June 2 which raises the risk weight on Polish banks' exposure to foreign exchange mortgages used for calculating their capital adequacy to 150 percent from 100 percent. About half a million Poles took out Swiss franc loans before the global financial crisis to benefit from a strong zloty and low interest rates in Switzerland and Polish foreign currency mortgages, mainly in Swiss francs, total 153 billion zlotys ($41 billion), or about 8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).  We estimate that the financial effect of the risk-weight increase on the entire banking sector will be up to 12 billion zlotys,  Moody's said, adding that the impact would be spread over time and would not curtail their lending. The KSF recommendation, accompanied by eight others, is likely to be introduced and will raise the cost to the banks of holding home loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Polish bank stock index is down by 1.6 percent since then. The loans became a hot political issue before the 2015 elections following a spike in the value of the Swiss franc in early 2015, which increased monthly instalments and the value of the FX mortgages for thousands of Polish families.  These measures replace the previously contemplated mandatory conversion of banks' foreign-currency mortgages into Polish zloty, which ... had the potential to severely affect some banks' capitalisation,  it added. Before the 2015 elections, politicians in the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party had called for a conversion of FX mortgages into zlotys at the exchange rates they were taken out at and that banks should bear the cost. PiS backed down, however, after estimates from the financial regulator and the central bank showed such a move would likely destabilise the whole financial system. Because of the rise in value of the Swiss franc over the last few years, many Poles still face an outstanding debt larger than the value of the real estate it was taken out to finance, despite years of paying back instalments on the loan. In February, PiS head Jaroslaw Kaczynski said that Polish borrowers seeking compensation should not expect the government to impose a settlement on the banks, but take their individual claims to court instead. The rise in mortgage servicing costs on Swiss franc mortgages expressed in zlotys has been softened by a further fall in interest rates in Switzerland in recent years.

The Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs of 'F1+' and the issue ratings of 'AA' on Qatar's long-term foreign-currency senior unsecured bonds have also been placed on RWN. Fitch has affirmed the Country Ceiling at 'AA+'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The RWN on Qatar's ratings reflects the heightened uncertainty resulting from the decision of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Egypt and some other Arab countries to sever diplomatic and logistical ties with Qatar. While some discussions have taken place to resolve the crisis, it is becoming more likely that the crisis will be sustained and negatively affect Qatar's economy and its credit metrics. Saudi Arabia and its allies have banned all land, sea and air transport between themselves and Qatar, with the apparent exception of the Dolphin oil pipeline that brings Qatari gas to the UAE. This has immediate repercussions as Qatar has been dependent on imports from its neighbours and on goods shipped from outside the region via the key port of Jebel Ali in the UAE. It is likely that given its vast resources Qatar will be able to handle strains on supplies of food and other goods, but at a cost, which might eventually be borne by the government. The countries involved have so far only imposed limited restrictions on financial flows and exposures to Qatar. An outright ban on financial relations with Qatar could lead to disruptions in the Qatari financial industry, but the authorities have the financial resources, in the form of central bank reserves as well as Qatar Investment Authority assets, to contain these strains. However, if the imposed isolation lasts for a longer period, the implications for Qatar's business environment and economic model would become more serious. Qatar's drive for diversification has focused on establishing the country as a regional hub and a destination particularly for tourists from the region. Prolonged isolation could undermine the business model of Qatari companies, including SOEs, potentially requiring costly bail-outs. The isolation could also adversely affect the public finances. The risk of further logistical and financial restrictions is increasing, and the risk of the use of military force, while still remote, can no longer be entirely excluded. Domestically, the isolation could lead to strains between those advocating reconciliation with Saudi Arabia and those supporting the highly independent position that Qatar has pursued so far, bringing political stability into question. The 'AA' ratings reflect Qatar's large sovereign assets (sufficient to finance more than 20 years of present budget deficits), along with the country's fiscal adjustment efforts, a large hydrocarbon endowment and one of the world's highest GDP per capita ratios. Qatar's hydrocarbon dependence is a key rating weakness, with oil and gas extraction averaging 50% of GDP and 80% of external receipts and government revenue. Other weaknesses include a government debt level above those of rated peers, and mediocre scores on the World Bank's measures of governance and the business environment (both below the 70th percentile). SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Qatar a score equivalent to a rating of AA- on the Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - Public Finances: +1 notch, to reflect exceptionally large government assets. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year-centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The RWN reflects the following risk factors that may individually or collectively result in a downgrade of the ratings: - Absence of a timely resolution to Qatar's isolation; - Further escalation of measures against Qatar; - Evidence that the measures taken against Qatar are having a significant impact on the economy or other credit metrics. Factors that could result in a removal of the RWN and the affirmation of ratings include: - Timely normalisation of Qatar's external relations without an adverse impact on the economy or other credit metrics. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that the authorities have access to sufficient liquid assets, in terms of central bank reserves and QIA assets, that it can address any short-term supply disruptions and liquidity issues in the financial markets.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Arab countries cut diplomatic as well as travel and trade ties with Qatar last week, accusing it of supporting Iran and funding Islamist groups. Doha denies the charges. The severing of air, sea and land transport links has closed off key import routes for Qatar and its population of around 2.7 million people. Thousands of shipping containers destined for Qatar are still stuck at Dubai's Jebel Ali port, according to Qatari importers. Iran and Turkey have flown in food supplies to Qatar as the gas-rich country seeks other sources. Oman is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council but takes a relatively independent diplomatic approach to the other five states in the bloc, particularly towards Iran. The two new services will each run three times a week between Qatar's Hamad Port and Omani ports of Sohar in the north and Salalah in the south, Qatar Ports Management Company (Mwani), a Qatari shareholding company established in 2009, announced on Sunday. Doha has said the severing of trade and transport ties are hurting the country's inhabitants. Mani Qatar posted a video on Twitter on Monday of a cargo ship arriving from Sohar port.

Ocado, which last week clinched a long awaited overseas deal with an as yet unnamed European retailer, also published its results for the 22 weeks to April 30, showing a strong increase in sales. Gross retail sales were up by almost a quarter to 600 million pounds, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 20.5 percent to 37.6 million pounds while pretax profit rose 45.7 percent to 6.7 million pounds.

Additionally it plans to secure about 150 million pounds through the amendment and extension of its revolving credit facility.

The champions looked their old selves in Montreal as Hamilton led team mate Valtteri Bottas to their first one-two since the Finn joined in January as replacement for retired champion Nico Rosberg. The Briton's 56th career victory was his sixth in Canada and third in a row, and he turned the tables on Ferrari with a peerless performance. Hamilton qualified on pole, the 65th of his career to equal the tally of his late Brazilian boyhood idol Ayrton Senna, led from start to finish and also set the fastest lap to complete the 'grand slam'. Coming two weeks after Monaco, where he had qualified badly and finished seventh as Ferrari enjoyed their first one-two since 2010, it was the perfect weekend.  I think for us, we really solidified our strength, we've got a better understanding of the car and hope we can put it in the same spot in the following races,  he told Sky Sports television.  Also we know now, after the last race, where to develop this car moving forwards which I think is really going to make a difference in winning this championship.  Hamilton warned, however, that there was still much to do and it would take time. Formula One - F1 - Canadian Grand Prix - Montreal, Quebec, Canada - 11/06/2017 - Mercedesâ Lewis Hamilton crosses the finish line to win the race.Paul Chiasson/Pool I don't think we've completely got rid of all the issues we have,  he said.  We've understood the tires, utilized the tires a lot better this weekend, but I think there's still things we've understood but that you can't just fix in two weeks.  So in terms of where we direct the development, the guys now in the factory have a much better goal. The goalposts have moved, but they know where it is and now they can work full steam ahead towards that.  Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, a four times champion, finished fourth on Sunday and saw his lead over Hamilton cut to 12 points with 13 races remaining. The German and Hamilton now have three wins each, with Bottas taking the other. Vettel had also qualified on the front row in Montreal but the expected battle between the two title contenders failed to materialize with the German having to fight through the field after his car's front wing was broken on the opening lap. Hamilton had no doubt Ferrari would be back to speed immediately.  They are still very, very quick. They've been so consistent all year. This is the only weekend they've had not the greatest result but they've not had a seventh or something like we've had,  he said.  So they are still very much there, they are still going to be very hard to beat.

In April, Britain's biggest union said it would hold a total of eight strikes, including at the Mini and Rolls-Royce factories, but suspended further action last month to allow staff to vote on a revised deal. The offer still proposed closing the scheme but offered a payment of 22,000 pounds ($28,000) over three years or 25,000 pounds paid into a new defined contribution pension scheme, Unite said on Monday. BMW has previously declined to comment on its offer. Nearly 57 percent of members who voted turned down the deal and union officials will now meet on Tuesday to discuss what next steps to take.  We would urge BMW bosses to reflect on the result and listen to the workforce by further engaging in meaningful talks with Unite,  National Officer for BMW Fred Hanna said in a statement.

Sharif's office on Monday confirmed the prime minister had received a summons by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), set up by the Supreme Court to investigate corruption claims that  surfaced following the Panama Papers leak. It said he would be attending an interview on Thursday. Pakistan's stock market slumped 4 percent as the news sent shudders through investors, fearful that instability in its fragile democracy would undermine an economy that has shown stronger growth in recent years. Sharif has denied any wrongdoing over his family allegedly using offshore companies to buy luxury flats in a posh London neighborhood, and said his family wealth was acquired legally. His spokesman did not respond to requests for comment over the latest development. In April, the Supreme Court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to remove Sharif from office on the back of Panama Papers leaks, but it ordered further investigations.  The JIT team comprises members of civilian agencies, such as the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), as well as members of powerful military bodies, including the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency. The JIT's work has become highly politicized in recent weeks. Sharif's camp has sought to remove two members of the JIT team, and his PML-N party voiced outrage over a leaked photograph taken from security camera footage showing Sharif's son, Hussain, appearing before the JIT. According to the summons document, seen by Reuters, JIT asked the Prime Minister's office to bring  all relevant record/documents/material  to the interview at its office in the capital, Islamabad on Thursday.  Itâs a litmus  test of our laws that are all citizens are equal in front of law, so we believe that Nawaz Sharif should appear before JIT in this case,  said Naeem ul Haque, spokesman for opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. The Supreme Court began investigating Sharif after the main political parties failed to agree on a committee to probe the Panama Papers leaks, and PTI's chairman, Imran Khan, threatened mass protests and to shut down Islamabad. If Sharif survives the JIT probe, opinion polls suggest he is favorite to win the next election, due by June 2018. Sharif, a three-time prime minister, was ousted twice in the 1990s, including by a military coup in 1999, but he swept back to power in an election in 2013. The internal political tensions have coincided with a fresh bout of tension with arch rival India. Pakistan's Foreign Office summoned India's deputy high commissioner on Monday after an outbreak of cross-border shelling in the disputed Kashmir region, in which it said one person was killed and several wounded.

A major security operation is underway after 17 people were killed last Wednesday in suicide bombings and gun attacks in Tehran, the first to be claimed by the hardline Sunni Islamist group Islamic State inside Iran, a Shi'ite power.  Police forces clashed with the four men and killed them in a mountainous area in southern Iran,  the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted a localÂ police chief as saying.  Two of those killed were not Iranian, he said, without elaborating.  Guns, ammunition, explosives and the flag of Islamic State were seized during the operation, Tasnim reported, citing the police chief. A local official at the port town of Jask, also in Hormuzgan, said five suspects linked to Islamic State were detained on Monday, Iran's Mizan news agency reported.  Southern Iran is home to a Sunni minority and has seen previous clashes between security forces and Sunni insurgent groups. The authorities say Iranian security forces killed the mastermind of the attacks on Saturday and that more than 50 suspects have been arrested around the country. Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of funding hardline Sunni militants, including Islamic State, and in the wake of last week's attack pointed the finger at its regional rival. Riyadh has denied involvement in the attacks. Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Raissa Kasolowsky","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-security-idUSKBN1930YO"},

Shares in chipmakers STMicro , Dialog and AMS all fell more than 4 percent following heavy losses at U.S. and Asian peers. Apple's worst drop in 14 months on Wall Street on Friday sparked a bout of profit-taking across richly valued tech stocks that have soared to record highs.  It's really hard to say whether this counter-rotation can be considered the start of something structural or just a natural correction,  Alessandro Balsotti, Head of Asset Management at JCI Capital, said. Europe's tech index fell 3.1 percent, leading sectoral losers in Europe and on track for its biggest one day loss since the post Brexit sell-off in June last year. The index has soared around 40 percent over the last year to hit a 15 year high earlier this month. Meanwhile, the pan-European index STOXX 600 was down more than 1 percent to its lowest level in seven weeks. The index was mildly supported by gains in oil prices which lifted energy stocks and by parliamentary election results in France which looked set to give President Emmanuel a huge majority to push through his pro-business reforms. Italy also offered some comfort to markets after the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement (M5S) suffered a severe setback in local elections. While the big win for Macron was expected, the result in Italy came as a surprise. France's CAC index fell 1.1 percent and Italy's blue chip index fell 0.8 percent, after briefly inching up in positive territory. Among individual stock movers, Temenos fell 4.8 percent after the banking software firm terminated a share buyback programme earlier than expected. The stock has gained 50 percent to record highs since the programme was announced in November 2016. An upbeat note from Citi supported shares in French carmaker Renault, which helped lift Europe's car index by 0.5 percent, the only sector to trade in positive territory along with the energy index. Among the gainers on the STOXX was Italian lender UBI Banca , which rose 2 percent on the first day of a 400 million euro cash call to strengthen its capital position.

Financial markets, schools, businesses and non-essential government services close when the signal,  No. 8, or above is hoisted. But business and financial markets were not seriously affected in Hong Kong as the signal was hoisted at 5:20 p.m. (0920 GMT), after hours for many businesses. The weather observatory said the typhoon was expected to make landfall within 50 km (30 miles) of Hong Kong later in the night, though early indications suggest the typhoon would not be a major one with wind speeds of 63 kph forecast. China's national observatory issued a blue alert for Merbok earlier on Monday, the state Xinhua news agency reported, the least serious level on its four-tier, colour-coded weather-warning system. There will be no trading in Hong Kong's financial markets on Tuesday morning if the typhoon signal remains at 8 or higher at 9 a.m. (0100 GMT). Trading will be suspended for the whole day if the storm signal is still at 8 or higher at noon.

The provider of pest control, cleaning, security and healthcare services reviewed its strategy and accounts after three profit warnings in a year, blaming uncertainty surrounding Brexit and rising costs. On Monday, the company reported an operating loss of 42.9 million pounds ($54.6 million) in the year to March 31 following one-off accounting adjustments. Chief Executive Phil Bentley, who took charge in December as part of a management overhaul, said Mitie's labour costs had hurt its competitiveness. It now  plans to automate processes in its HR, finance and workforce management departments to deliver 45 million pounds of cost efficiencies over three years, working with Microsoft as a technology partner. Market reaction was positive, with shares gaining almost 10 percent. Bentley, former head of UK energy supplier British Gas, said Mitie had a way to go in terms of automation compared to his previous employer. Mitie, which employs 53,000 people, had already cut just under 200 jobs and there were indications of more to come.  We have a lot of costs that are duplicative and we do have a lot of manual processes... If I've got people processing manual time sheets and I can get a computer to do it then that's what I'm going to do,  he told Reuters. Bentley also painted a brigher picture for the company which competes for work with companies such as Capita, Serco and G4S.  We are now focused on the future of the business and I am encouraged that our order book has held up and our pipeline is growing,  he said in the company's results statement. Analysts said the market was giving Bentley's new mangement team the benefit of the doubt.  Investors will take heart from sector peer G4S, which is about to re-enter the FTSE 100 after a major turnaround under (CEO) Ashley Almanza,  said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.  That said, the road to redemption could be a bumpy one,  he added, noting sluggish growth in key markets.

Investors were also cautious before Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting which is expected to raise interest rates and possibly give signals about the pace of future hikes that could influence appetite for emerging markets assets.     Poland's zloty eased a quarter of a percent to 4.1932 against the euro by 0857 GMT, while other Central European currencies were steady.      Some investors may be also closing their positions ahead of the expected Fed hike and lower zloty liquidity due to Thursday (Corpus Christi) national holiday,  one Warsaw-based dealer said.     Some investors expect the breakdown of Polish May inflation data, due at 1200 GMT, to show lower inflation pressure than earlier expected.     That would underpin forecasts from Polish central bank governor Adam Glapinski that the bank is unlikely to start to lift its record low interest rates until the end of next year.      Another rate setter, Lukasz Hardt, warned last month that a tightening of the labour market could lift wage-side inflation pressure as the European Union allows visa-free travel to Ukrainians.     From this week, Ukrainians can travel to EU member states without visas, raising the risk that some of the hundreds of thousand of Ukrainians who work in Poland may move further to the West, causing a labour shortage in Poland.      As the risks of the inflation rate overshooting the (2 percent) target in the medium term are relatively low, the MPC (central bank) is likely to sustain its relatively dovish rhetoric, especially as demand pressure has been limited despite labor market tightening,  Erste analysts said in a note.      At this point, we see a possibility of a rate hike only in (the second half of 2018),  they added.     Warsaw's bluechip stock index fell 1.2 percent, with the sub-index of bank shares shedding 2 percent, while Western European bank shares also eased, with the STOXX Europe 600 banks index dropping 1.2 percent.

The Conservative partyâs loss of a majority in last weekâs general election weakens its hand in talks with the European Union. Bringing Jeremy Corbynâs Labour into talks could strengthen it, and cut the chance of a chaotic exit. If, that is, Corbyn can be persuaded to collaborate. Prime minister Theresa May will struggle to convince her EU counterparts that the UK can stick to any agreement she strikes, after her bid to strengthen control failed. They also know May risks a party split whatever terms she agrees, either by angering the âhardâ Brexiteers or the pro-Europeans in her party. That ultimately hurts Britain, and businesses may curtail investment if they fear a government collapse. Some 57 percent of UK businesses are now pessimistic about the economy, compared with 34 percent before the election, according to an Institute of Directors survey. The obvious solution is for Mayâs Conservatives to bring the opposition Labour party into talks. That might involve current Brexit negotiators taking instructions directly from a cross-party committee, or even delegating the process to a new group. That would give the UK a more credible negotiating position, and give businesses some clarity. It would allow parties to put some distance between the Brexit outcome and day-to-day domestic politics. Two groups might reject such a deal. One is the fringe within the Conservative party that wants an abrupt exit, and would see their hand diluted. Yet their leverage is currently limited: they are unlikely to try and bring down the government while Labour is strong. The other is Corbyn. The current situation allows him to remain ambiguous over what kind of exit he wants, drawing support both from voters who want to leave and from those who want to stay. A Conservative split could accelerate his route to power. Yet cooperation on Brexit is in Corbynâs interests too. If the Conservatives collapse, he will find himself in a similarly tricky position, struggling to reconcile the different views of his voters. If May reached out to him, he declined to help and talks broke down, he might be partly blamed for the resulting mess. Mayâs career is probably over anyway. Reaching out to Labour would show her as a leader who put her country before her party. That is no bad legacy.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The plane, an Airbus A330-200 twin jet, landed without incident late on Sunday and there were no injuries, said Kathy Zhang, general manager for the Oceania region at China Eastern Airlines.  The crew observed the abnormal situation of the left engine and decided to return to Sydney airport immediately. All passengers and crew members were landed safely,  she said. Photographs published by several Australian media outlets showed a large gash well over a meter long in the casing of the left engine. The Australia Transport Safety Bureau was starting an  investigation and an update would normally be available within a month but could come sooner if a  more serious issue  was identified in its early stages, Bob Armstrong, a spokesman for the bureau said. A spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce, which manufactured the plane's Trent 700 series engines, said in a statement:  We are aware of the incident and will be working closely with our customer and relevant partners to understand the cause of the issue.  An Airbus spokesman said the company was in contact with Rolls-Royce to determine what occurred, and it would support the investigation into the incident. Professor Jason Middleton, an aviation expert at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said it appeared that the engine cowling had been ripped away forward of the main compressor blade.

It could have begun from loose screws,  he told Australian Broadcasting Corp News. China Eastern's Zhang said a comprehensive investigation would involve aviation authorities from Australia and China.  Slideshow (3 Images)Ground-handling company Cathay Pacific had inspected the plane before take off, Zhang said. The company was not immediately available for comment.  The engine for the aircraft is a big issue so we need to investigate with the governments, with the Rolls Royce company and with our headquarters as well,  she said. Television station Seven News reported that passengers heard a bang shortly after Flight MU736 took off and could smell burning before the flight turned back.  We went up in the air and all of a sudden we heard this noise ... it kind of smelt like burning. Oh, I was scared. Yeah, I was really scared. Our group was terrified,  one unidentified passenger told Seven News. Another passenger, identified only as Eva, said the cabin crew tried to calm passengers and told them to fasten their seatbelts after a noise was heard.  We were very panicked because we had no idea what was happening,  she told Channel 9 television.

A government website for the non-binding referendum, Puerto Rico's fifth such plebiscite since 1967, showed 97 percent supported statehood. Only 23 percent of the 2.2 million eligible voters participated in the vote. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello campaigned for statehood as the best avenue to boost future growth for the island, which has $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate, woefully underperforming schools and near-insolvent pension and health systems.  From today going forward, the Federal government will no longer be able to ignore the voice of the majority of the American citizens in Puerto Rico,  Rossello said in a statement.  It would be highly contradictory for Washington to demand democracy in other parts of the world, and NOT respond to the legitimate right to self-determination that was exercised today in the American territory of Puerto Rico,  he added. Puerto Rico's hazy political status, dating back to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain, has contributed to the economic crisis that pushed it last month into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.  I voted for statehood,  Armando Abreu, a 74-year-old retiree, said after voting.  Even if it's still a long way off in the distance, it's our only hope.  Those in favor of statehood for the mainly Spanish-speaking Caribbean island hope the new status would put the territory on equal standing with the 50 U.S. states, giving them more access to federal funds and the right to vote for U.S. president. FILE PHOTO: The flags of the U.S. and Puerto Rico fly outside the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico May 4, 2017.Alvin BaezUnder the current system, Puerto Rico's 3.5 million American citizens do not pay federal taxes, vote in presidential elections or receive proportionate federal funding on programs like the Medicaid health insurance system for the poor. The U.S. government oversees policy and financial areas such as infrastructure, defense and trade. Rossello will ask Congress to respect the result, but Puerto Rico is seen as a low priority in Washington.    'Bogus Plebiscite' Slideshow (11 Images)The island's two main opposition parties boycotted the vote, which gave Puerto Ricans three options: becoming a U.S. state; remaining a territory; or becoming an independent nation, with or without some continuing political association with the United States. Puerto Rico's former governor, Rafael Hernandez Colon, said in a statement:  A contrived plebiscite fabricated an artificial majority for statehood by disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Commonwealth supporters.  Rather than heading to the polls, some 500 Puerto Ricans marched on the streets of San Juan, waving Puerto Rico's flag and burning the American flag while chanting in support of independence.    This is a bogus plebiscite. Our future is independence. We need to be able to decide our own fate,  said Liliana Laboy, one of the organizers of the protest. Boycotters were also angry about the costly referendum at a time when over 400 schools have closed and many Puerto Ricans are struggling to make ends meet. Schools where voting took place were in poor condition, with cracked paint and bare-bones playgrounds. Puerto Rico spent an estimated $8 million on the campaign and election process, according to a government spokesman.

Einhorn,Mitch Golden,Nathaniel August,Steve Algert,Thomas Hill,US,HEDGEFUNDS,GREENLIGHTMASTERS,Wealth Management,Hedge Funds,Funds,Major News,Graphics,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Corporate Events,Investment Management and Fund Operators (TRBC),United States","sector":"Subjects","content":" BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York's Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can't get from sitting in an office.   This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,  the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.  His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.Â     Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm' Â    Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research's HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index's 3.3 percent return over the same period.  It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden's clients.  Golden is known for the time he takes â sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.  He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.   Mitch hustles hard to know who's out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn't ready to invest immediately,  said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters' portfolio for a decade.  To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.   We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,  Golden said.  It is a very subtle balance.   Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis.  For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.   The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a  Kabuki dance  in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.  Mitch Golden, portfolio manager for hedge fund Greenlight Masters, speaks during an interview at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. Photo taken May 8, 2017.Brendan McDermidSometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.  Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam's biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.  Playground Chats  On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central ParkÂ talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.  Slideshow (2 Images)Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.  In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhornâs Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.  He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill's $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August's $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden's top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.  Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates' early dramatic gains.   That can be very costly,  he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.  Greenlight Masters is Einhorn's brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.  Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.  After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a  D-meet  with Einhorn at Greenlight's midtown Manhattan offices.   It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,  he said.

After Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and others last week severed diplomatic and transport links with Qatar after accusing it of sponsoring terrorism, the UAE blocked vessels carrying Qatari crude from entering the Emirates' oil ports. This is disrupting the typical logistics of the oil industry where buyers take very large crude carriers (VLCC) capable of carrying 2 million barrels of oil and load up to four different 500,000-barrel cargoes to save on costs. Buyers are now splitting cargoes on smaller Suezmax ships that carry 1 million barrels to load separately in Qatar and the UAE, the sources said. Suezmax rates are now expected to rise to between Worldscale (WS) 75 to 80 on higher demand for these vessels, said two of the sources. CSSA, the shipping arm of French oil major Total, South Korean refiner SK Energy and BP have provisionally booked four Suezmax tankers to load crude and condensate in Qatar and the UAE in the second half of June at rates of WS67.5 to WS68.5, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. Worldscale is a formula used to calculate freight costs.  Operations are very messy. Some refiners need to re-arrange or break their cargoes into Suezmaxes which are more costly,  a Singapore-based trader said. Companies are also arranging to perform ship-to-ship transfers of smaller parcels onto VLCCs in the water off Sohar, Oman, which has stayed neutral in the conflict, the sources said. Qatar is one of the smallest oil producers in the Middle East, but almost all of its just over 600,000 barrels per day of production heads to Asia. Qatar Petroleum's upstream oil partners include Total and Occidental Petroleum Corp.  We all just do not know if this situation will be solved within the next few days or will drag on for weeks or months,  said Ralph Leszczynski, head of research at Banchero Costa. In addition to crude, Qatar also exports between 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes a month of naphtha, an oil product typically refined into petrochemicals. Shipowners have now added a premium for ships loading Qatari fuel for Asia, the sources said. Owners are adding 2.5 percentage points more, or about $700 a day, for tankers on this route, a Singapore-based shipbroker said.

China allows imported beans to be used by crushers to make soymeal for animal feed but none of the beans, all of which are genetically modified, are permitted for use in food products. Reports over the years have suggested however that several million tonnes of the cheaper imports could be flowing illegally into the food sector. On Monday, the most-active soybean futures hit 3,996 yuan ($587.82), their highest since March 10, as talk circulated that China's quarantine authority had asked several east coast ports to strictly inspect and punish firms found to be illegally reselling imported beans to food companies. CHS Inc is being probed as part of the investigation, according to a report by Bloomberg on Friday. Calls to the Chinese unit were directed to the headquarters in the United States. Prices ended the day at 3,957 yuan ($582.08) a tonne on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, up 1.5 percent on the day. The gains came after prices jumped 1.8 percent on Friday in their biggest daily gain in more than a month. Open interest - a measure of liquidity in the market - jumped by a quarter on Friday to 287,132 lots, equal to 2.9 million tonnes of beans worth about 11.4 billion yuan. Data for Monday will be released on Tuesday.  Last week this news came out that the ports were investigating this problem of leaking of imported soybeans,  said Liang Yong, an analyst with Galaxy Futures.  If the trade in imported soybeans is subject to controls, the demand side will all fall on the domestic beans.  China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing's efforts to crack down on leaking of imports into the food sector come after China imported record volumes this year and spurred hopes among some investors that the steps may help to erode big domestic oversupply. Still, a prolonged crackdown will upset major exporting nations including the United States and Brazil. Imports in the first five months of the year reached 37.12 million tonnes, 20 percent higher than the same period of last year. China produces around 13 million tonnes of soybeans, all of which go to the food sector to make soymilk, tofu and other products.

A study by the non-governmental International Justice Mission (IJM), Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in Mumbai, mapped nearly 10,000 commercial sex workers in more than 1,000 brothels, and about 200 sex workers operating from private establishments. In brothels, it found the prevalence of minors had dropped to 5.5 percent during the course of the study from 2015 to 2016, from an estimated 40 percent in the past. It found 25 minors in private locations.  About six to seven years ago, a customer could talk to a pimp and ask for a young girl. Now, it is not possible. They will first say no, until they establish the customer is not a police informer,  said Sanjay Macwan, regional director for India at IJM.  We strongly believe the number of children has gone down.  He credited the drop to police anti-human trafficking units and new laws that have made sexual offences against minors punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment. Macwan said the study was not aimed at tracking a shift of young girls from public to private venues, but it did point to the need for more research.  We need to understand how crime is going into covert spaces. Our biggest challenge was to find girls in private locations,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Some of Asia's oldest and largest red light districts are in Mumbai, a key destination for trafficked women and children. Most are lured from other states and neighboring countries, often with the promise of good jobs in a home or shop. Instead, many are forced into sex work or manual labor. The sex trade has shifted over the past five to 10 years from hot spots such as Kamathipura, Mumbai's oldest red light district, to private lodges and residential areas. The IJM study noted that technology such as WhatsApp and the Mumbai version of the classified ads website Backpage.com have facilitated the underground sex trade. Researchers interviewed 15 survivors, most of whom had been forced into the trade when they were aged 16 to 25, and had no idea where they were being taken when they were brought to Mumbai. Most did not speak Hindi or Marathi - the main spoken languages in the city - and were abused physically and sexually to coerce them into the trade, the IJM study found.

It was a groggy start to the week for shares as the hangover of Apple's near 4-percent dunking on Friday hit Asian rivals including Samsung and Europe's big chipmakers STMicro and Dialog. Europe's tech index fell 2.8 percent to put it on track for its biggest one-day loss since October. The index had reached a 15-year high earlier this month and has soared around 40 percent over the last year. The pan-European STOXX 600 was down a more manageable 0.6 percent, mildly supported by modest gains in oil prices which lifted shares in energy stocks and by the first round of parliamentary election results in France which look set to give President Emmanuel Macron a huge majority to push through his pro-business reforms. Italy also offered some comfort after the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement suffered a severe setback in local elections after failing to make the run-off vote in almost all the main cities up for grabs. It spurred on debt markets. Italian government bond yields, which move inverse to price, fell to their lowest since January , Portugal's tumbled to nine-month lows while France's bonds closed the gap on benchmark German Bunds.  Macron doing well in the first round of the French parliamentary elections bodes well for him getting a majority,  said Lyn Graham-Taylor, fixed income strategist at Rabobank.  The fact that 5-Star did poorly in local elections in Italy also suggests a setback for populism in Europe.  The euro rose back to $1.1220 in the currency markets where anticipation is also building ahead of Wednesday's conclusion of a two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central bank is widely expected to nudge up U.S. interest rates by another quarter point, but economists will be watching to see whether the recent dip in economic data and wave of uncertainty surround Donald Truump has weighed on confidence. Britain's sterling also remained in focus as it began to backslide again. It was hovering at $1.2730 and 88.08 pence per euro as Prime Minister Theresa May attempted to prop up her position after her party's last week's damaging election.  The political risks are mounting,  said Kathleen Brooks, head of research with City Index in London. Feds Up The dollar was a shade lower at 110.040 yen. The Bank of Japan also meets this week and it too will be closely following the yen's 4 percent gain since mid-May. The dollar index against a basket of currencies nudged down to 97.118, easing back from a nine-day high hit at the end of last week after U.S. President Trump navigated the testimony of ex-FBI chief James Comey. On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions will face questions at a Senate hearing about Comey's firing and about undeclared meetings with Russian officials, though it is unclear whether he will testify in public or in private. In commodities, crude oil prices extended gains after rising on Friday when a pipeline leak in major producer Nigeria overshadowed supply worries weighing on the market. U.S. crude and Brent were both 0.6 percent higher at $46.10 and $48.45 a barrel, respectively, while copper rose for a fourth straight session and gold snapped a three-day losing streak to climb to 1,269 an ounce.

France is Germany's second-biggest trading partner and the strong support for pro-European centrist reformer Macron has sparked hopes that Berlin and Paris will spearhead a broad-based economic revival in Europe and a push for more integration in the euro zone.

Merkel and Macron agreed last month to draw up a roadmap to deeper EU integration and suggested the bloc's treaties may change to facilitate even more ambitious reform.  The finance ministers of both countries, Wolfgang Schaeuble and Bruno Le Maire, have set up a joint working group that will present ideas by July on deepening euro zone integration.     Germany's Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn said he hoped that Macron would now be able to quickly implement reforms that would boost growth in France's economy.  If we can help in this regard, we will certainly help,  Spahn told Deutschlandfunk broadcaster. Spahn, a senior member of Merkel's conservatives, said Berlin was open to discuss Macron's proposals for a joint euro zone finance minister and a shared budget in the bloc, but said it was important to first clarify the role and responsibilities. He repeated Berlin's rejection of a mutualization of debt within the currency bloc, a step many Germans fear would make Berlin pay for struggling states that resist reform. However, he said Germany was willing to increase its role in financing investment projects in Europe.  We're open for a lot of things in this regard,  Spahn said.

French President Emmanuel Macron leaves his home before voting in the first of two rounds of parliamentary elections in Le Touquet, France, June 11, 2017.Philippe Wojazer Unprecedented Setback  Projections by three pollsters of LREM's tally after the second round ranged from 390 to 445 of the assembly's 577 seats - potentially the biggest majority since president Charles De Gaulle's conservatives won more than 80 percent of seats in 1968. Macron, a former investment banker, wants what supporters describe as a  big bang  of economic and social reforms, including an easing of stringent labor laws and reform of an unwieldy pension system. The pro-European leader's program enjoys strong support among liberal, well-educated voters in France's big cities, but he is less popular in poorer areas where industry is in decline.  Slideshow (6 Images)Sunday's projections pointed to another torrid night for the two main traditional parties, which have suffered high-profile defections to Macronâs government, as well as the far-right National Front. The Socialist Party suffered in particular. Its chief, Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, confirmed he had been eliminated from his long-held Paris seat, a symbol of his party's stunning demise after five years in power. Benoit Hamon, its failed presidential candidate, was also headed for the exit door. Cambadelis acknowledged that the first round marked an  unprecedented  setback for the party, set to win a paltry 30-40 seats, and the broader left.   It is neither healthy nor desirable for a president who gathered only 24 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidentials and who was elected in the second round only by the rejection of the extreme right should benefit from a monopoly of national representation,  Cambadelis said. Francois Baroin, who led the campaign of the conservative Republicans, projected to win 80-100 seats, echoed the sentiment. National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who led the voting in her northern constituency, called the huge abstention rate  catastrophic  and urged supporters to turn out in a week's time. Pollsters projected her party, which is still reeling from her disappointing showing in the presidential run-off vote against Macron, will next week win just a small handful of seats - perhaps as few as one.      Among the LREM political newcomers who went through to second round were his key ministers and a retired bullfighter.

France is Germany's second-biggest trading partner and the strong support for pro-European centrist reformer Macron has sparked hopes that Berlin and Paris will spearhead a broad-based economic revival in Europe and a push for more integration in the euro zone. Projections after the first election round on Sunday showed that Macron's fledgling party is set to trounce France's traditional main parties and secure a huge majority to push through pro-business reforms.  Chancellor Merkel: My heartfelt congratulations to @EmmanuelMacron to the great success of his party in the first election round. Strong vote for reforms,  the government tweeted. Merkel and Macron agreed last month to draw up a roadmap to deeper EU integration and suggested the bloc's treaties may change to facilitate even more ambitious reform. The finance ministers of both countries, Wolfgang Schaeuble and Bruno Le Maire, have set up a joint working group that will present ideas by July on deepening euro zone integration. Germany's Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn said he hoped that Macron would now be able to quickly implement reforms that would boost growth in France's economy.  If we can help in this regard, we will certainly help,  Spahn told Deutschlandfunk broadcaster. Spahn, a senior member of Merkel's conservatives, said Berlin was open to discuss Macron's proposals for a joint euro zone finance minister and a shared budget in the bloc, but said it was important to first clarify the role and responsibilities. He repeated Berlin's rejection of a mutualisation of debt within the currency bloc, a step many Germans fear would make Berlin pay for struggling states that resist reform. However, he said Germany was willing to increase its role in financing investment projects in Europe.  We're open for a lot of things in this regard,  Spahn said.

If Japan gets its way in the periodic contract review, the world's biggest buyer of LNG would have to import more short-notice supplies from producers such as the United States, another step away from rigid deals that run for decades towards a more active spot market.  At stake for Qatar are 7.2 million tonnes of annual liquefied natural gas (LNG) sold in contracts that expire in 2021. The $2.8 billion a year in gas mostly goes to Japan's JERA, a joint venture between Tokyo Electric and Chubu Electric that is the world's single biggest LNG buyer.   Since the crisis emerged, the Japanese are sure not to renew all contracts and they will push very hard to get more flexible terms,  said an advisor on LNG contracts, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of ongoing negotiations.  Qatar and Japan as seller and buyer will each account for nearly a third of 300 million tonnes to be shipped this year in 500 tankers. Any change in how volumes trade between them is sure to jolt an industry where practices in place since the 1970s are already being challenged.  In some ways the situation is similar to what happened in Europe between 2008 and 2014, when amid an economic crisis and tensions between Europe and Russia, European utilities renegotiated gas purchase terms, freeing up more supplies for spot markets.  Three deals between Japan and Qatar are under a periodic review, three sources with knowledge of the matter said, potentially allowing for some adjustments, and the buyers may also only partially renew the contracts when they expire.  An official with a Japanese buyer would not comment on individual contracts, but said purchase agreements were typically reviewed every five years.  That fits with the deals under discussion, which will expire in 2021 and were signed in 1997/1998 and in 2012.  Qatar Petroleum was not available for comment.  Tables Turn LNG volumes grew to 260 million tonnes last year from 250 million tonnes in 2015, produced by around a dozen countries, with more than half coming from Qatar, Australia and Malaysia.  Thirty-nine countries imported LNG in 2016, up by four from the previous year, with 70 percent of world consumption in Asia.      Facing competition from new producers, Qatar talked tough with Japan ahead of the contract reviews, warning buyers not to demand too many changes, or Japanese companies could be squeezed out of their stakes in Qatar's LNG projects.  But the tables have turned since Arab nations including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) cut ties with Doha, boycotting its trade and weakening Qatar's negotiating position.  Cheniere, the only U.S. company to export LNG so far, is offering its supplies as an alternative.   This dispute is a timely reminder of the value of the diversity and flexibility of supply that destinationâfree U.S. exports bring to individual buyers,  said Cheniere spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder.  Unlike other exporters, Cheniere allows its buyers to re-sell cargoes.  The Qatar crisis  will further encourage international LNG buyers to include more American LNG ... for reliability reasons,  said Kent Bayazitoglu, director of market analytics at Gelber & Associates in Houston.  More Trade: Survey This all comes as a growing number of producers and importers are joined by more commodity houses that trade LNG.  Supplies are outpacing demand, leaving a lot of LNG stranded without takers and pulling down Asian LNG spot prices by over 70 percent since 2014 to below $6 per million British thermal units.  Trying to bring their LNG to the market, producers including Australia's Woodside Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell have said they will grant greater contract flexibility.  Spot LNG trading made up 18 percent of supplies in 2016, up from 15 percent a year before, according to the International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers.  In an informal Reuters survey, a majority of more than 30 industry experts expected at least 25 percent of Asian LNG volumes to be traded in the spot market by the end of next year. And if Japan wins concessions from Qatar, this share could rise faster, traders said.  Preparing for this, trading houses are beefing up their LNG presence. Top commodities traders Vitol [VITOLV.UL] and Glencore have both said this year that they expect more spot trading over the next 18-24 months.  Vitol says its physical LNG trading volumes will rise from 3 million tonnes in 2016 to 4.5 million tonnes this year. Japanese trading houses, eyeing the changes being driven by the country's utilities, are also preparing for more spot trade.  We are going to reinforce our LNG team at our energy trading unit in Singapore as LNG spot trading is on the rise,  Hiroyuki Kato, executive vice president of Mitsui & Co Ltd said last week.

British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party needs the DUP's 10 seats to be able to govern after it failed to secure an absolute majority in a parliamentary election on Thursday. In an article in the Belfast Telegraph, Foster listed three priorities, including getting Northern Ireland's devolved power-sharing government at Stormont working again.  Talks between the DUP and Irish nationalists Sinn Fein on forming a power-sharing government are due to restart in Belfast later on Monday.   We stood on a clear policy platform of wanting to strengthen the Union, of working for a good deal for Northern Ireland as the United Kingdom leaves the EU, and of promising to do our best to get Stormont up and running again for the benefit of all,  Foster wrote.  We will use the position we find ourselves in to do as we promised.  Sinn Fein is seeking a referendum in the coming years on Northern Ireland splitting with the United Kingdom and joining a united Ireland. Such a referendum is permitted for under Northern Ireland's 1998 peace deal and any attempt to block it would be fiercely opposed by Irish nationalists.  Foster, who is due to meet May on Tuesday to finalize a deal, said the DUP would also be  mindful of our responsibility to help bring stability to the nation at this time of challenge.  A source close to the DUP on Saturday said the party was seeking more funding for the province and concessions for former British soldiers as part of a deal, but would avoid social issues like abortion and gay rights where they disagree with Conservative Party policies.

Ota, a historian, sprang to national and international attention as governor of the southern Japanese island at the time of big protests against U.S. bases following the rape of a Japanese girl by three American servicemen in 1995. The protests led to a U.S.-Japan agreement in 1996 to close the U.S. Marines' Futenma air base and move its functions from a crowded part of the island to a less populous location. But persistent resentment of the American military presence, associated by many residents with crime, pollution and accidents, has delayed the move for more than two decades.  During the war, Okinawa became a bulwark for the defense of Japan and many people were sacrificed,  Ota, who fought in the so-called Blood and Iron Corps mobilized to defend the island, told Reuters in 2010.  About 140,000 civilians died in the three-month Battle of Okinawa, along with about 94,000 Japanese soldiers and more than 12,000 Americans.  We don't want Okinawa to become a battlefield again,  Ota said, explaining his opposition the bases on the island, host to the bulk of the U.S. military presence in Japan.  Ota was also critical of the Japanese wartime military and worried the lessons of Japan's wartime past were being forgotten. During his tenure as governor, he was responsible for the building of a  Cornerstone of Peace  monument in the Okinawa Peace Memorial Park, on which the names of those who died in the Battle of Okinawa - regardless of nationality or whether military or civilian - are inscribed. Ota, who received a master's degree in journalism from Syracuse University in New York, was also a prolific author.

May looked set to face criticism and anger from Conservative MPs at a private meeting in parliament over her handling of an election that lost the party its parliamentary majority. The Conservatives won 318 seats out of the 650 in last Thursday's vote, meaning they now require support to govern and have chosen the eurosceptic Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has 10 seats, for that. However, despite the shock result and speculation there could soon be a leadership election, May's position appeared safe for at least the immediate days ahead.  I don't detect any great appetite amongst my colleagues for presenting the public with a massive additional dose of uncertainty by getting involved in a self-indulgent Conservative Party internal election campaign. ,  Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative lawmakers, told BBC TV. If she fails at the meeting to reassure lawmakers that she can govern effectively however her critics are likely to step up calls for her to go. Senior figures, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who is touted as the favourite to replace May should she be forced out, have pledged loyalty and called on colleagues to rally behind her. In a further bid to win over disillusioned lawmakers, May appointed Michael Gove, a long-serving cabinet minister with whom she has clashed in the past, as environment minister while two of her closest aides, who many blamed for the election result, resigned. However, George Osborne, a former finance minister who is now editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper and a vocal critic of May, said she appeared a  dead woman walking . On Tuesday, May is due to meet the DUP leader Arlene Foster to finalise a deal to ensure support for May's minority government on major issues. Brexit Secretary David Davis said that some policies planned before the election would be pruned back. Brexit Talks The political turmoil comes a week before Britain is due to start negotiating the terms of its exit from the European Union in talks of unprecedented complexity that are supposed to wrap up by the end of March 2019, when Britain actually leaves. That timeline now looks even more ambitious than before, not least because May's electoral debacle has emboldened those within her own party who object to her  hard Brexit  approach of leaving the European single market and customs union.  The interpretation that we have put on it ... is that people voted for three things in essence, control of borders, control of laws, control of money,  Davis told BBC radio.  In order to deliver that you can't do that inside the single market, so what do you do, you try and have the best possible access from outside.  Davis also said walking away without securing a deal with the remaining 27 EU states remained a possibility. The uncertainty has hit business confidence, according to a survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD). It found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the UK economy from its last survey in May. The pound slid to its lowest level for nearly two months after the vote, but the fall was much less severe than the one sparked by the Brexit vote in June 2016. On Monday, the currency was under pressure once again.  It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could â if not addressed immediately â be disastrous for the UK economy,  Institute of Directors director general, Stephen Martin, said.

In the worst Gulf Arab crisis for years, the UAE, along with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, cut diplomatic as well as travel and trade ties with Qatar, accusing their fellow Gulf state of supporting Iran and funding Islamist groups. Doha denies the charges. Before the decision Gulf Arab citizens could easily travel, reside and work across the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The restrictions have left thousands of Qataris cut off from relatives in a region where cross-border marriages are common and Gulf rulers refer to each other as  brothers .  Qataris married to Emiratis will not be deported,  The National wrote on Monday, without giving a source for the information.  UAE airports and borders have been ordered to allow any Qatari citizens who are immediate relatives of Emiratis to pass through,  it added. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report. The move appears to be part of recent efforts to lessen the human toll of the rift. On Sunday authorities in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain said they were setting up hotlines to help families with Qatari members, without elaborating. Saudi state news agency SPA reported late on Sunday that King Salman has ordered authorities to  take into consideration humanitarian situations of Saudi-Qatari joint families,  appearing to clarify the previous announcements. Bahrain issued a similar statement on its state news agency.  Saudi Arabia also said that Qataris who wanted to perform Islamic pilgrimages were also exempt from the measures and would be allowed into the Kingdom as normal.  The pilgrims from Qatar are in the hearts of their Saudi brethren from when they enter the Kingdom until their departure,  SPA said, quoting the official body in charge of Mecca and Medina, Islam's two holiest sites. In a statement on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told Gulf states to ease their measures against Qatar which he said were forcing the separation of families and causing children to be pulled out of school.  Our expectation is that these countries will immediately take steps to de-escalate the situation and put forth a good faith effort to resolve their grievances they have with each other,  he said. Qatar said on Saturday it would not expel citizens of the countries that had cut ties with it.

Funds are relatively abundant in the international market and the supply of high-quality bonds falls short of demand,  the state-owned bank said in a statement to Reuters.  Yields on bonds by Chinese issuers are more attractive than those of other emerging market issuers.  Moody's last month downgraded China's credit ratings for the first time in nearly 30 years, to A1 from Aa3, reflecting its growing concern that China's financial strength is fading amid a ballooning debt pile CDB, the biggest policy bank in the country, said that China's government has  effectively lowered debt risks  by implementing local government debt swaps, a de-leveraging campaign, and disposing non-performing loans in the banking sector. The one-notch downgrade in long-term local and foreign currency issuer ratings  lacked sufficient estimates about China's supply-side reforms and the impact of stabilising economic growth , CDB said in the statement. Financial regulators in Hong Kong, Singapore and Europe so far haven't made  substantial adjustment  to regulatory requirements, such as high-quality liquidity assets (HQLA), following the Moody's ratings cut, CDB said.

Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 30 years, said he expected about 5.5 million tourists this year.  Cambodia has clearly established itself as an attractive destination for cultural and natural tourism,  Hun Sen said at an international tourism conference in Siem Reap province. Hun Sen projected there would be seven million tourist arrivals by 2020, which should earn the country $5.5 billion and create 800,000 jobs. Despite its beaches and Angkor temples, Cambodia long had a reputation for war, genocide and violent political instability. But it has been become a favorite with backpackers and budget travelers over the past decade or so and has more recently begun to establish itself as a luxury destination. Foreign tourist arrivals rose 11.9 percent in the first quarter of 2017, according to figures from the Tourism Ministry, with a total of 1.5 million visitors from January to March. Chinese tourists accounted for the biggest group of visitors in the first quarter, data showed. Kong Sopheareak, director of the Tourism Ministry's statistics department, told Reuters that good ties between Phnom Penh and Beijing had contributed to an increase in Chinese arrivals.  There are more direct flights now and Chinese tourists also seek investment opportunities when they visit,  he added.

British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party needs the DUP's 10 seats to be able to govern after it failed to secure an absolute majority in a parliamentary election on Thursday. In an article in the Belfast Telegraph, Foster listed three priorities, including getting Northern Ireland's devolved power-sharing government at Stormont working again. Talks between the DUP and Irish nationalists Sinn Fein on forming a power-sharing government are due to restart in Belfast later on Monday.  We stood on a clear policy platform of wanting to strengthen the Union, of working for a good deal for Northern Ireland as the United Kingdom leaves the EU, and of promising to do our best to get Stormont up and running again for the benefit of all,  Foster wrote.  We will use the position we find ourselves in to do as we promised.  Sinn Fein is seeking a referendum in the coming years on Northern Ireland splitting with the United Kingdom and joining a united Ireland. Such a referendum is permitted for under Northern Ireland's 1998 peace deal and any attempt to block it would be fiercely opposed by Irish nationalists. Foster, who is due to meet May on Tuesday to finalise a deal, said the DUP would also be  mindful of our responsibility to help bring stability to the nation at this time of challenge.  A source close to the DUP on Saturday said the party was seeking more funding for the province and concessions for former British soldiers as part of a deal, but would avoid social issues like abortion and gay rights where they disagree with Conservative Party policies.

The week was set to be dominated by a series of central bank meetings and UK Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to form a workable administration after losing her majority on Friday. With a fourth rise in U.S. rates in 18 months now fully priced-in for Wednesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's head of G10 currency strategy, Athanasios Vamvakidis, pointed to the chance of a weaker greenback after the meeting. But he also warned that the Bank of Japan a day later might spark some more retracement of the yen's 4-percent gain since mid-May.  The hike by the Fed is fully priced but the language will be dovish,  Vamvakidis said.  What will be interesting will be the BOJ - there have been headlines that the BOJ has been discussing an exit from emergency stimulus. They may well want to bite back against that (and) the yen has come a long way in the past few weeks.  The dollar was marginally lower at 110.21 yen, having retreated from Friday's one-week high of 110.815 yen. Against the euro it dipped a quarter percent to $1.1222, compared to a seven-month low of $1.1285 set in early June. As May scrambles to pick up the pieces and reunite her Conservative Party before Brexit negotiations due to start next week, the economic signs for the pound continue to worsen. Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers cut their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month, as households turned more cautious even before the shock election result. Against that is the hope of a softer approach to the Brexit talks that Friday's election results have engendered in markets. Worries that the process would take Britain out of the lucrative European single market have left the pound around 20 cents weaker than when Britain voted to leave the European Union a year ago.  Based on parliament as it stands, Theresa May would be able to approve a soft Brexit but not a hard one,  said Vamvakidis. Sterling last traded at $1.2726, down 0.1 percent on the day, after sliding 1.7 percent on Friday, its biggest one-day drop in around eight months.  The political risks are mounting,  said Kathleen Brooks, head of research with City Index in London.  A potential rethink on the UK governmentâs Brexit stance could limit downside for the pound, at least for now. However, not even the rising odds of a soft Brexit have been enough to spark positive momentum.

The Fed's preferred measure of price pressures earlier this year had shown signs of breaking out of five years of stagnation to reach the Fed's 2 percent inflation goal, partly on hopes of the Trump administration's fiscal stimulus. But lack of progress on the Trump agenda, only a wisp of wage growth, and three straight months of falling oil prices have sapped that momentum. Inflation in other major economies has plateaued or is weakening as well. On Thursday, the European Central Bank downgraded its inflation forecasts. Protracted low price growth hurts the economy as companies struggle to charge more for goods and services, salaries stagnate and investors get low returns. Policymakers worldwide have pegged an annual 2 percent inflation rate as optimal for supporting healthy business and consumer spending growth. U.S. bond yields and so-called breakeven rates among Treasury Inflation Protection Securities are the lowest in seven months, and the gap between long- and short-dated bond yields has reached the narrowest since last November. Few expect the trend to change soon.  The inflation background remains challenged. It will keep bond yields low,  said John Bellows, portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Co in Pasadena, California. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise rates at its policy meeting next week as the economy moves toward the Fed's mandate of full employment. In May, the jobless rate hit a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. The Fed, which ended its near zero interest rate policy in December 2015, last raised rates in March to its target range of 0.75-1.00 percent. Conviction on a rate hike beyond next week's Fed meeting is up in the air. On Friday, federal funds futures implied traders saw a coin-toss for another rate hike by year-end FFZ7. And the forward rate curve has flattened, suggesting less confidence in the Fed meeting its forecasts for three rate hikes in 2017 and another three in 2018. The lowered rate-hike expectations since mid-March has helped to revive a bond market rocked by worries about a more aggressive Fed and higher inflation under President Donald Trump's policies. From the end of 2016 to March 14 when the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR reached its 2017 peak of 2.64 percent, Treasuries and other investment-grade bonds lost 0.44 percent, according to an index compiled by Barclays and Bloomberg .BCUSA Since March 14, the Barclays/Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate bond index has produced a total return of 2.89 percent, bringing its year-to-date return to 2.44 percent. Inflation Misses Most alarming to investors and a few Fed officials is that the Consumer Price Index and other U.S. inflation barometers have flatlined or retreated from levels earlier this year, raising doubts about whether price growth could reach the Fed's 2 percent goal. Along with back-to-back months of the CPI growth falling short of traders' expectations, the core rate on U.S. personal consumption expenditure slipped to 1.50 percent on a 12-month basis through April, the slowest pace for the Fed's preferred inflation gauge since December 2015. A Reuters poll released on Friday showed analysts' median forecast on U.S. core PCE fell to 1.5-1.7 percent per quarter in 2017 from 1.7-1.8 percent in a prior poll conducted in May. Last month, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said the retreat in core inflation was  concerning.  But the consensus view among Fed officials has been that inflation would reach 2 percent in the medium term. The bond market has adjusted to the recent sluggish inflation data. In the $13.9 trillion TIPS market, the yield gap between 10-year TIPS and benchmark 10-year Treasuries, a gauge of investors' inflation expectations, has steadily narrowed since mid-March to 1.81 percent on Friday. Speculators have piled on bets in the futures market that the Fed may slow its rate hikes in light of the disappointing inflation data. Investors are not upbeat about inflation outside the United States either. Their five-year price view on the euro zone in five years hovered above 1.50 percent on Friday, below the ECB's 2 percent target.  Inflation isn't taken off in most developed markets,  said Bill Merz, senior market strategist at U.S. Bank in Minneapolis. But data showed some investors remain confident the setback in U.S. inflation is temporary and price growth would accelerate later this year. TIPS-focused funds have continued to attract money since late 2016, with their assets reaching an all-time peak of nearly $63 billion in the week ended June 7, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit.  The U.S. government will release its May CPI report at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT) on Wednesday before the Fed announces its rate decision at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT).  For the Fed to carry out more rate hikes, we need to see more inflation,  said Matt Toms, chief investment officer of fixed income at Voya Investment Management in Atlanta.

With the Fed widely expected to raise interest rates at its two-day meeting that ends on Wednesday, the focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of further tightening in the months to come and next year, and any further details on its plans for trimming its balance sheet.     The focus is on whether the Fed is looking at three or four rate hikes this year, according to Argonaut Securities analyst Helen Lau.     Higher interest rates tend to boost the dollar and bond yields, putting pressure on gold prices by increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.       With the UK event risk successfully negotiated, it would appear the market is putting more emphasis on this week's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) rate hike,  said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst with OANDA, adding that markets had priced in an almost 100 percent chance the Fed would lift rates.     The market is also anxious to see if the Fed becomes more dovish in its outlook, he said.         Spot gold        was up 0.1 percent at $1,266.90 an ounce as of 0813 GMT, after shedding 1 percent in its biggest one-day percentage decline since May 18 in the previous session     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,269 an ounce.     In the wider markets, Asian stocks edged lower in early trade on Monday following a slide by U.S. technology shares.                  The dollar index against a basket of currencies dipped 0.1 percent to 97.135        following its rise to a nine-day high of 97.500 on Friday.     Among other metals, spot palladium        was up 0.2 percent at $892.50 per ounce after rising to a high of $911.50 an ounce, just below a 16-year high hit on Friday.      The palladium market is experiencing a short-squeeze which we believe is driven by investment demand rather than industrial demand,  Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said in a note.      Eventually, the weaker demand backdrop from automotive catalysts should be reflected in deteriorating sentiment and falling prices. We remain bearish and stick to our short-recommendation.       Silver        was down 0.1 percent at $17.15 per ounce, while platinum        rose 1.1 percent to $943.30 per ounce.

Fitch Ratings expects a further rise in lending to the mainland in 2017, with tight onshore liquidity conditions likely to add to the incentives for Chinese companies to borrow offshore. Hong Kong banks have already reported a 10% qoq rise in Mainland China exposure (MCE) in 1Q17, compared with growth of just 6% over the whole of 2016. Total MCE of foreign banks rose by 3.7% in 2016 to USD1,642 billion, after falling by 14% in 2015, according to data compiled by Fitch. Growth in the second half of 2016 slowed slightly, to 1.2% from 3.7% in 1H16. Hong Kong banks account for the largest share of foreign banks' MCE, at 48.9% at end-December, followed by Singapore at 7% and the UK at 6%. The UK's share would be 17% if it included the MCE of UK banks' Hong Kong subsidiaries. Hong Kong banks' MCE rose to 29.3% of system-wide assets at end-March, up from 27.3% at end-December. Rising interconnectedness between the Hong Kong and Chinese economies is driving growth now that the fall in FX-speculation-linked lending in 2015 has run its course. Client referrals from Chinese parent companies of bank subsidiaries based in Hong Kong remain a key source of growth in Hong Kong exposure to mainland borrowers. We also expect Hong Kong banks' mainland subsidiaries to grow as they expand their retail operations in southern China. These subsidiaries have become more active in mortgage lending in major Chinese cities, but this could slow as a result of the tightening of local regulations to cool the housing market. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogr.am/hong_kong_banks_mce_continues_to_rebound?src= embed  title= Hong Kong banks' MCE continues to rebound  width= 550  height= 676  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > Steady growth in lending to Chinese corporates and other non-bank borrowers - particularly private and non-mainland entities - is likely to continue, in part to support their expansion overseas. The non-bank segment accounted for almost three-quarters of Hong Kong lenders' MCE at end-March 2017. Claims on banks tend to be more volatile than those on non-banks, as shown by their 25% growth in the first quarter. The strong rise in 1Q17 could be an indication of a pick-up in trade-related growth, given that MCE to banks often takes the form of a Chinese bank's guarantee of corporate exposure. Exposure to banks accounted for 26% of MCE at end-March, up from a low of 23% at end-December 2016, but still well short of the peak of 43% three years earlier. Fitch continues to view China-related exposure as the biggest asset-quality risk for Hong Kong's banks, given that China's economy is highly leveraged and is going through a structural slowdown. That said, MCE has performed relatively well so far, even if the latest data show that the quality of banks' MCE continued to slowly deteriorate on average last year. A few banks have suffered above-average China-related losses, and some have scaled back their riskier onshore SME lending.

After Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and others last week severed diplomatic and transport links with Qatar after accusing it of sponsoring terrorism, the UAE blocked vessels carrying Qatari crude from entering the Emirates' oil ports. This is disrupting the typical logistics of the oil industry where buyers take very large crude carriers (VLCC) capable of carrying 2 million barrels of oil and load up to four different 500,000-barrel cargoes to save on costs. Buyers are now splitting cargoes on smaller Suezmax ships that carry 1 million barrels to load separately in Qatar and the UAE, the sources said. Suezmax rates are now expected to rise to between Worldscale (WS) 75 to 80 on higher demand for these vessels, said two of the sources. CSSA, the shipping arm of French oil major Total, South Korean refiner SK Energy and BP have provisionally booked four Suezmax tankers to load crude and condensate in Qatar and the UAE in the second half of June at rates of WS67.5 to WS68.5, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. Worldscale is a formula used to calculate freight costs.  Operations are very messy. Some refiners need to re-arrange or break their cargoes into Suezmaxes which are more costly,  a Singapore-based trader said. Companies are also arranging to perform ship-to-ship transfers of smaller parcels onto VLCCs in the water off Sohar, Oman, which has stayed neutral in the conflict, the sources said. Qatar is one of the smallest oil producers in the Middle East, but almost all of its just over 600,000 barrels per day of production heads to Asia. Qatar Petroleum's upstream oil partners include Total and Occidental Petroleum Corp.  We all just do not know if this situation will be solved within the next few days or will drag on for weeks or months,  said Ralph Leszczynski, head of research at Banchero Costa. In addition to crude, Qatar also exports between 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes a month of naphtha, an oil product typically refined into petrochemicals. Shipowners have now added a premium for ships loading Qatari fuel for Asia, the sources said. Owners are adding 2.5 percentage points more, or about $700 a day, for tankers on this route, a Singapore-based shipbroker said.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) surprised markets in mid-March by raising short- and medium-term interbank rates hours after the Fed raised overnight borrowing costs. The move prompted some analysts to speculate the PBOC had decided to  synch  its moves with those of the U.S. central bank in a bid to reduce persistent depreciation pressure on the yuan currency against the dollar and discourage capital outflows. It also dovetailed with China's pledges to tackle risks from an explosive rise in debt. Six out of 10 traders in China's money, forex and bond markets asked by Reuters said they believed China would move rates up if the Fed did so. But the size of the move would be more modest, and it would likely be confined to rates on open market operations (OMOs), the traders said. They did not expect a hike in China's benchmark lending rate, which has been unchanged for nearly two years. The Fed is expected to increase interest rates by another 25 basis points at its June 13-14 meeting. Several increases by the PBOC earlier this year were mainly of 10 basis points, and traders expected any move this week to be of a similar magnitude. Chinese stocks rose modestly after the Fed's March rate increase, which was seen as increasing investors' risk appetite. There was little reaction in Chinese forex and money markets.  There are huge discrepancies between the benchmark OMO rates and market rates. A slight upward movement would be quite normal,  said a Shenzhen-based trader at a Chinese bank. She said any impact from higher market rates would not quickly filter through into the real economy, though most analysts believe slowly tightening credit and higher financing costs will begin to drag on broader activity in coming months.  However, four of the 10 traders said they did not think a PBOC rate rise was on the cards this week. They argued monetary policy is already tightening as Beijing presses ahead with its  deleveraging  campaign to contain and reduce risks in the financial system, and as banks grow more cautious about lending as they prepare for a rigorous quarterly inspection of their books by the PBOC. The one-month Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR)  SHICNY1MD= has risen to its highest since April 2015.  This mid-year timeframe is already relatively sensitive, and add to that short-term rates are already not low. To raise rates further would put a lot of pressure on the market,  said a trader at a regional bank.  If they really insist on following (the Fed funds rate) higher, the timeframe will probably be pushed back.  Uncertainty over policy has also increased after sharp, sudden gains in the yuan in recent weeks, which some analysts believe were engineered by the PBOC as a pre-emptive buffer to flush out short sellers ahead of the expected Fed hike and dampen any resulting depreciation pressure.  Market players were split on whether the central bank would raise rates on its medium-term lending facility (MLF). The PBOC has been lending at longer maturities, which has increased borrowing costs for banks. One trader at a major Chinese bank said if the central bank decided to raise the OMO rate, it would likely wait to increase the MLF until July when it is likely to renew maturing MLF loans. June is traditionally a tense month for liquidity in the financial system, as companies pay taxes and banks scramble for funds to meet a quarterly health check. Analysts say while the PBOC has taken some steps to clarify its intentions, it remains vague in telegraphing rate moves.  Banks want to know what their cost of funding is going to be, so that volatility isn't great in terms of managing their business and liquidity,  said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics. Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has been historically reluctant to reveal too much about the PBOC's strategies, even likening the bank in an interview with Caixin last year to a chess player unwilling to reveal tricks to an opponent.

Qatari Finance Minister Ali Sherif al-Emadi sounded confident when he told CNBC television that the economy was essentially operating as normal and Doha could easily defend its currency. Many investors still hope for a diplomatic solution in coming weeks. Dubai's Drake & Scull rose 1.7 percent. It has been climbing in unusually large volumes since Thursday. Former chief executive Khaldoun Tabari has sold his stake in the company to Tabarak Investment, a source told Zawya, a Thomson Reuters publication. Tabarak Investment's stake stands at around 18 to 20 percent after the sale, making it the largest shareholder, Zawya said. In April, DSI said it would sell 500 million dirhams ($136 million) of shares to Tabarak as part of its capital restructuring programme, subject to regulatory approval.

Pollsters said Macron was on course to win as much as three quarters of National Assembly seats in the June 18 second round after 28 per cent of those who voted in Sunday's first round chose his Republic on the Move (LREM) party. That would be France's biggest majority in decades, and effectively leaves only the powerful trade union movement as a potential obstacle to the pro-business reforms ex-banker Macron has promised to introduce in a bid to boost growth and jobs. French borrowing costs fell on Monday, tightening the gap over benchmark Germany. France's 10-year government bond yield fell 3 basis points to 0.62 percent, outperforming other higher-rated euro zone peers. The gap over benchmark German Bund yields tightened to around 36 basis points from around 39 bps late on Friday. But fewer than half of the 47 million voters turned out in the first round - the lowest level by far in a legislative election in the 60-year-old fifth Republic. Macron was a political unknown three years ago and is heading a start-up party, but as the scale of his likely victory emerged on Sunday, his opponents saw a danger to democracy. Just a month after the 39-year-old won a bitter and drawn-out battle for the presidency, some questioned whether he had a mandate to pursue a pro-business reform agenda. The spokesman for Macron's government recognised the challenge that lies ahead.  We have to restore trust,  said Christophe Castaner, who is also minister for parliamentary relations, on Monday.  It is the government's responsibility, that of the president, that of the prime minister, to restore trust in the election process,  he told France 2 Television  We don't want a majority to have an easy time of it. We want a majority that will reform,  he added. Crushing Blow The vote delivered a crushing blow to the Socialist and conservative parties that had alternated in power for decades until Macron's election in May blew apart the left-right divide. First-round results decided only four of the 577 seats on offer, leaving the rest to be fought out on June 18 by two or more candidates who survived elimination. Nationally, LREM gathered 28.2 percent of the votes cast. Conservative party The Republicans and allied centre-right Union of Democrats and Independents came second with 18.8 percent but look set to lose half of their seats and possibly end up with fewer than 100 compared with more than 400 for LREM. Marine Le Pen's National Front (FN) scored 13.2 percent and the ruling Socialists just 7.4 percent. Pollsters predict the FN may not improve on the two seats it won in 2012 despite far-right leader Le Pen's strong showing in recent years, while the Socialists who ruled with a majority for the past five years may have only have 30 or 40 seats. Macron, the youngest leader since Napoleon, has to make good on campaign pledges to revive France's fortunes by cleaning up politics and easing regulations that investors say hobble the euro zone's second-biggest economy.

June is traditionally a tense month for liquidity in the financial system, as companies pay taxes and banks scramble for funds to meet a quarterly health check. Analysts say while the PBOC has taken some steps to clarify its intentions, it remains vague in telegraphing rate moves.  Banks want to know what their cost of funding is going to be, so that volatility isn't great in terms of managing their business and liquidity,  said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics. Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has been historically reluctant to reveal too much about the PBOC's strategies, even likening the bank in an interview with Caixin last year to a chess player unwilling to reveal tricks to an opponent.

The Beijing-backed RCEP has been given new impetus by U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, to which China is not party. The two trade deals are not mutually exclusive, and some countries would be members of both. But Singapore's prime minister has said that the United States' exit from the TPP had hurt confidence in U.S. policies. Beijing is also increasingly positioning itself as a global free trade champion.     If we can successfully conclude these negotiations quickly, it will be an important statement in favor of free trade and economic integration,  Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told reporters in Beijing after meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.  At this point in time, it is more necessary than ever before,  he said. Wang repeated China's position that it would work to conclude RCEP negotiations as soon as possible.

Nations party to the talks, launched in 2012 and expected to create a free trade area of several billion people, have expressed hope of signing a deal by the end of the year, though previous targets have been missed. Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan (L) shakes hands with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi before a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, China on June 12, 2017.Greg Baker/PoolRCEP is less comprehensive than TPP and the main focus is reducing tariffs. Coverage of services is more modest than in the TPP, and it would not have protection for labor rights or the environment. China-Singapore ties have showed recent signs of strain but Balakrishnan said that both he and Wang had agreed that bilateral relations were  stable, calm, and positive . Recent sore points between the two countries include Hong Kong's seizure of nine Singaporean armored vehicles in  November that were being shipped from military exercises in Taiwan.  Singapore's armed forces have maintained long-standing if low key military training facilities in Taiwan, and Beijing officials used the seizure to warn countries against security ties with the island, which it regards as a breakaway province. Singapore has also deepened its security ties to the United States in recent years and remains concerned over China's assertiveness in the disputed South China Sea.

The survey of nearly 700 members of the business group also exposed deep concern over the political uncertainty and its impact on Britain's economy. May failed to win a parliamentary majority in the election. Her hopes of forming a government now lie with winning support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats in the election. [nL8N1J8039] The IoD found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the UK economy from its last survey in May. While 20 percent of members were optimistic about the economy over the next 12 months, some 57 percent were either quite or very pessimistic - a -37  net confidence  score. That compares with a -3 percent score in May. Related CoveragePolitical instability set to impact UK growth, says leading S&P economist It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could â if not addressed immediately â be disastrous for the UK economy,  said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.  The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government.  The IoD survey said its members saw no clear way to quickly resolve the political situation, feeling that a further election this year would have a negative impact on the economy. They are keen to see quick agreement with the European Union on transitional arrangements for the UKâs withdrawal from the bloc, and clarity on the status of EU workers in Britain. Business Need     Also on Monday, Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said there was now a risk that businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year's Brexit vote.  When uncertainty reaches such a level then you get pause buttons beginning to be pressed and we don't want to see that,  she told the BBC.   So I think it's time for a bit of a reset, a bit of a mindset change to listen really well to what businesses need.  Fairbairn said she hoped to see the Brexit negotiations on  a really positive track so we can see an outcome on really good access to the single market.  Earlier on Monday, figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result. The data found households cut their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.[nL9N1ID00W] Reporting by James Davey and William Schomberg; Editing by Richard Balmforth","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy-idUSKBN1930MS"},

The world's biggest auto market got a shot in the arm in 2016, growing at its fastest pace in three years, after Beijing halved the purchase tax on smaller-engined vehicles. But buyers have shied away since taxes climbed to 7.5 percent, from 5 percent, at the start of this year. Auto sales in China fell 0.1 percent in May from a year ago to 2.1 million vehicles, China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Monday. In April, sales recorded their steepest fall in 20 months. The current downturn in China's auto market could extend through July or August, said Xu Haidong, a CAAM spokesman.  Last year was just too strong and now the policy impact is fading away,  said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight.  The growth (last year) overdrew some of the demand.      In the first five months of 2017, sales grew 3.7 percent  from year-ago levels, CAAM said at a briefing in Beijing. This was smaller than the 7 percent growth seen over January-May 2016 and trails CAAM's forecast for 5 percent growth this year. China's auto market recorded a 13.7 percent rise in sales last year, helped by the tax incentive. The purchase tax on vehicles with engines of 1.6 litres or below will rise to the normal 10 percent next year. The latest CAAM data shows sedan sales in China fell 9.3 percent year-on-year in May, with sport-utility vehicles proving to be the lone bright spot for passenger vehicles, growing by 13.5 percent as Chinese continue to trade up to larger vehicles. Foreign brands that are strong in the small sedan segment have seen sales slow this year. General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) all recorded declining sales in the first five months of the year. Meanwhile, commercial vehicles posted rapid growth, led by lorry sales that grew 18.3 percent, indicating the strength of the overall economy. Sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles flipped to a year-to-date rise, versus a drop over the first four months, as China accelerated subsidy approvals after a slow start to the year.

The latest CAAM data shows sedan sales in China fell 9.3 percent year-on-year in May, with sport-utility vehicles proving to be the lone bright spot for passenger vehicles, growing by 13.5 percent as Chinese continue to trade up to larger vehicles. Foreign brands that are strong in the small sedan segment have seen sales slow this year. General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) all recorded declining sales in the first five months of the year. Meanwhile, commercial vehicles posted rapid growth, led by lorry sales that grew 18.3 percent, indicating the strength of the overall economy. Sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles flipped to a year-to-date rise, versus a drop over the first four months, as China accelerated subsidy approvals after a slow start to the year.

Money managers slashed their net short position in CBOT corn to 138,758 futures and options contracts from 200,981 in the prior week, according to data from the U.S. Commodities Trading Commission for the week ended June 6.  On the same date in 2015, the corn short was around 110,000 contracts, and 2015 and 2017 are the only two years in which funds were ever bearish on corn in May or June. A soaking wet, cold spring followed by scarce rain across many portions of the U.S. Corn Belt has led to lower-than-expected corn conditions. Weather models were back and forth last week on forecasted rainfall amounts, but the uncertainty was enough to keep the funds heading for the exit late in the week. The bearish speculative corn stance through June 13 should drop far below the 100,000-mark for the first time since March 21, as fund buying has been very heavy since June 7.   CBOT corn posted a record volume of over 1 million contracts on June 7, topping the previous record of 930,250 set on March 31, 2016. The volume of 825,629 contracts on June 8 was good enough for fifth all-time. In the previous two years, the spring and summer rallies had funds maxing out their net longs near 250,000 futures and options contracts after covering between 420,000 and 480,000 contracts along the way (reut.rs/2scCsyv). Soy Complex Reaches Bear Bottom Speculators hit all-time bearishness in the soy complex for third week in a row, but the week ended June 6 should retain the record (reut.rs/2sM6o1z). Funds have been snatching up the oilseed and its products in the days since off the same U.S. weather worries as corn along with some good buying opportunities off 14-month lows in CBOT soybean futures at the end of May. In the week ended June 6, funds extended their net soybean short to 94,737 futures and options contracts from 89,310 in the week before. This represents the third most bearish spec stance on the oilseed, but based on buying activity since, the record of 103,963 contracts set on May 26, 2015 may not be exceeded in the near term. The new net short in CBOT soybean meal of 50,941 futures and options contracts â an extension from the 44,500 in the week prior â topped the previous record bearish view of 49,388 contracts in the week ended Jan. 5, 2016.  Money managers extended their net short in CBOT soybean oil to 34,301 futures and options contracts from 22,313 in the previous week. The most bearish stance on the vegoil within the last three years was 50,706 in the week ended April 11. Minneapolis Leads Wheat Hot and dry weather is gripping the U.S. spring wheat belt and speculators have not failed to notice. For the first time since Dec. 11, 2012, there are no managed money shorts in the Minneapolis spring wheat market.  The outright long in the week ended June 6 reached 9,486 futures and options contracts and represents both the biggest weekly adjustment in a month the most bullish spring wheat view since Feb. 28. The previous weekâs net long was 4,976 contracts (reut.rs/2reHDZU). Front-month Minneapolis wheat futures have been on the climb since early May and hit near two-year highs on June 8. Weather forecasts for the Northern Plains had not shown improvement toward the end of last week, meaning that funds are likely to further extend their long position. Concerns over less-than-ideal weather has also worked its way into the winter wheat market, but funds did not drastically shift their stance on Chicago wheat last week, cutting their bearish position to 106,136 futures and options contracts from 113,760 in the week prior. Changes to K.C. wheat views were also subdued as money managers shaved their net long to 2,394 futures and options contracts from 3,221 in the previous week.

Moon made a lengthy speech at the National Assembly to explain why the economy needed a boost in fiscal spending of  11.2 trillion won ($9.95 billion) in the second half of this year, which is aimed at creating 71,000 public sector jobs and 15,000 private sector jobs.  If we leave our current jobless situation as is, there are concerns it may later return to us as an economic crisis equaling a national catastrophe,  said Moon in an unprecedented call for an extra budget. His parliamentary address is the first ever on an extra budget by a president, underscoring his commitment to his job-creation agenda. Moon, who won a May election, promised to create 810,000 public sector jobs within his single five-year term, hoping to resolve soaring youth unemployment hovering near a record high of 11.2 percent as of April this year.  Both parties in the conservative opposition - the Liberty Korea Party and the Bareun Party - have opposed the proposed extra budget, posing a challenge to Moon's ruling Democratic Party in passing the bill as it needs the support of more than 30 opposition lawmakers. Moon's party only holds 40 percent of the 299 seats in the National Assembly.  In his speech, Moon also said income inequality was worsening in Asia's fourth largest economy, and the government can help to resolve it if the National Assembly approved the extra budget designed to boost jobs and household income.  About 8.8 trillion won of the extra budget will be financed by excess tax revenue expected this year, while the remaining 2.4 trillion will come from government revenue left over from 2016 and public funds managed by state-owned companies.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in delivers a speech at the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea June 12, 2017.Ahn Young-joon/PoolThe supplementary budget will add to the 400.5 trillion won budget for 2017 that was approved by the National Assembly late last year.  Separately, the central bank said monetary policy needed to stay accommodative to support the economy, but adjustments should be reviewed if growth remained strong.   For now, the accommodative stance in monetary policy needs to be maintained,  Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said in a speech celebrating the bank's 67th anniversary.  Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol speaks during a news conference at Seoul Foreign Correspondent's Club January 22, 2015.Kim Hong-Ji Having said that, if economic recovery continues and shows clear signs of improvement, we may need to adjust the pace of monetary policy easing so we will need to thoroughly review such cases.  Lee said he saw upside risks to the bank's economic growth estimate of 2.6 percent for this year, thanks to improving exports and the supplementary budget proposed.  But for now, uncertainty remained high and inflationary pressure was not strong, which meant the bank should maintain its current record-low interest rate of 1.25 percent for the time being, he said. South Korea's economy grew 1.1 percent in January to March on a seasonally adjusted basis, its strongest in six quarters. Most analysts believe the central bank will keep borrowing costs unchanged for the rest of this year, before it considers starting to normalize rates next year.

With the grasscourt season beginning with the Aegon Open on June 14 followed by Wimbledon in July, Konta said she does not feel any extra pressure to add to her three WTA titles.  I am not feeling any more expectation than previous years. My own expectations in terms of how I want to do have stayed the same,  Konta told reporters ahead of her first match at Nottingham.  I can only ever do my best so where my best on the day will take me, will take me. I try to approach every game the same.

The plane, an Airbus A330-200 twin jet, landed without incident late on Sunday and there were no injuries, said Kathy Zhang, general manager for the Oceania region at China Eastern Airlines.  The crew observed the abnormal situation of the left engine and decided to return to Sydney airport immediately. All passengers and crew members were landed safely,  she said. Photographs published by several Australian media outlets showed a large gash well over a meter long in the casing of the left engine. The Australia Transport Safety Bureau was starting an  investigation and an update would normally be available within a month but could come sooner if a  more serious issue  was identified in its early stages, Bob Armstrong, a spokesman for the bureau said. A spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce, which manufactured the plane's Trent 700 series engines, said in a statement:  We are aware of the incident and will be working closely with our customer and relevant partners to understand the cause of the issue.  An Airbus spokesman said the company was in contact with Rolls-Royce to determine what occurred, and it would support the investigation into the incident. Professor Jason Middleton, an aviation expert at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said it appeared that the engine cowling had been ripped away forward of the main compressor blade.

Television station Seven News reported that passengers heard a bang shortly after Flight MU736 took off and could smell burning before the flight turned back.  We went up in the air and all of a sudden we heard this noise ... it kind of smelt like burning. Oh, I was scared. Yeah, I was really scared. Our group was terrified,  one unidentified passenger told Seven News. Another passenger, identified only as Eva, said the cabin crew tried to calm passengers and told them to fasten their seatbelts after a noise was heard.  We were very panicked because we had no idea what was happening,  she told Channel 9 television.

The U.S. index provider will decide later this month whether to add yuan-denominated shares to key equity benchmarks. Scandals and trading halts at Hong Kong-listed mainland firms have made passive fund managers' jobs difficult already. Bringing in onshore tickers could complicate things further. MSCI will announce on June 20 whether A-shares traded on mainland exchanges will finally join its $1.5-trillion emerging markets index. The odds look skewed towards inclusion. In March MSCI slashed its original list of 448 candidate stocks down to 169, all of them tradable via the Stock Connect programmes linking Hong Kong to exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. By doing so MSCI partly addressed issues of concern among its constituents, namely worries about market access and cross-border profit remittance.  Graphic: Doing much better: reut.rs/2siLiei Less clear, however, is how asset managers will cope with the continued proliferation of prolonged trading halts on the mainland, one of three main reasons cited for not including A-shares last time around. Suspensions of mainland shares in Hong Kong have already caused problems. China Huishan Dairy and Hanergy Thin Film, for instance, grew big enough in market capitalisation to be added to MSCIâs China benchmark. Unfortunately they both got suspended from trade afterwards, trapping the cash managers had invested in order to replicate the benchmark.  On the mainland, where companies can easily request a trading halt, the problem is more acute. In Shanghai, 77 stocks, or 5.8 percent of the total, were suspended as of June 1. MSCI reckons the proportion of shares suspended from trading in China is the highest in the world. At the peak of 2015 market crash around 300 mainland names stopped trading, many with only vague explanations. Some of the firms that halted so can be found among the 169 stocks that would be ported into MSCI's index under the new plan. MSCI is trying to reduce this risk by excluding Chinese companies that have halted trade for over 50 days. Embarrassed Chinese regulators are also moving to discourage whimsical suspensions. But new halts are still possible, and when they follow allegations of fraud or other governance problems they ding confidence. If MSCI decides to wait another year, this might be the reason why.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Shares in chipmakers STMicro (STM.PA) and Dialog (DLGS.DE) fell more than 4 percent following heavy losses at U.S. and Asian peers.  The worst drop in Apple shares (AAPL.O) in 14 months on Wall Street on Friday sparked a bout of profit-taking across richly valued tech stocks that have soared to record highs this year. Europe's tech index .SX8P fell 2.3 percent, leading sectoral losers in Europe and on track for its biggest one day loss since October 2016. The index has soared around 40 percent over the last year to hit a 15 year high earlier this month. The pan European index STOXX 600  was down 0.4 percent, mildly supported by gains in oil prices which lifted shares in energy stocks and by parliamentary election results in France which appeared set to give President Emmanuel a huge majority to push through his pro-business reforms. Italy also offered some comfort after the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement suffered a severe setback in local elections.  Top gainer on the STOXX was Italian lender UBI Banca (UBI.MI), which rose 3 percent on the first day of its day of a 400 million euro cash call to strengthen its capital position after offering to take over three small rescued banks.

The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) said in a notice state-owned enterprises (SOEs) must transfer functions that  do not match the main direction of their business development  to local authorities. The country's heavily indebted state-owned firms, most of which have been carved out of state bureaus, have been under pressure to ditch schools, hospitals, retirement homes, firefighting services and other  social functions  in order to cut costs and focus on their core businesses. The assets, which also include water supply and household sewage treatment infrastructure, as well as environmental and public health facilities, will be transferred to the government free of charge, the SASAC notice said. From 2018, no state firm will be obliged to cover the costs of  social functions  that have already been transferred to local governments, it added. China's state firms were obliged to provide lifelong employment and cradle-to-grave social welfare as part of its  iron rice bowl  system.  But with thousands of companies tottering on the brink of bankruptcy in the 1990s, the government promised it would implement reforms in order to reduce their burden.   The process has been complicated, however, with under-resourced local governments unable to afford to renovate run-down SOE-owned infrastructure or cover the health care, education and pensions of thousands of retired workers and their families, especially in  one-company towns  where the SOE was the major source of income.

The decision by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Baharain and Egypt to cut diplomatic and transport ties this week threatens to hurt Qatar's trade balance, suck deposits from its banks and push out foreign investment. Reflecting this threat, the riyal fell on Friday in the offshore forwards market to its lowest level against the dollar since December 2015, when low oil and gas prices raised concern about all the Gulf economies. But the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter is so rich that it could offset the threatened capital outflows by liquidating just a portion of its financial reserves. And as long as it can keep exporting gas, its current account balance is unlikely to go deep into the red. That means the riyal's spot market peg of 3.64 to the dollar is probably safe for the foreseeable future. Any decision to change the peg would essentially be political rather than economic. At their lowest on Friday, forwards prices implied riyal depreciation of under 2 percent over the next 12 months. Many economists at financial institutions in the Gulf decline to discuss Qatar publicly because of the political tensions, but privately they say they expect Qatar to defend its currency successfully.  We are not looking for the Qatari peg to break,  wrote Chris Turner, global head of strategy at Europe's ING, though he called the pressure on the riyal unprecedented and said other countries' experience in the past 25 years indicated that if the peg did break, the riyal could fall at least 20 percent. Assets Cutting Qatar's credit rating to AA- this week, Standard & Poor's put the government's liquid external assets at 170 percent of gross domestic product, or about $295 billion, based on the International Monetary Fund's estimate of Qatari GDP. Capital outflows could come in several forms. Foreign investors have already started to sell Qatari equities; a complete pull-out could mean an outflow of nearly 10 percent of the stock market, or about $15 billion. Qatari banks had 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) of foreign liabilities in March, most in the form of loans and deposits from foreign banks. Less than half that is from banks in other Gulf states. Some Saudi, UAE and Bahraini banks have already started to cut their exposure to Qatar, and they could cut aggressively if the diplomatic crisis continues and their governments order them to do so. Riyadh may also try to force foreign banks to choose between the Saudi and Qatari markets. If foreign banks cut two-thirds of their exposure to Qatar in coming months, that could mean an outflow of over $80 billion. Then there is the current account balance. Before the crisis, the IMF predicted firm oil and gas prices would help Qatar run a surplus of $1.2 billion this year, rising gradually to $4.7 billion in 2020, against a deficit of $3.5 billion last year. Ten percent of Qatar's exports, which the IMF has estimated at $70 billion this year, are to countries that have blocked trade, S&P; calculated; import costs are likely to rise because of the closure of the land border with Saudi Arabia. Costs may also rise as Qatar's isolation forces it to pay higher wages to the foreign professionals and workers who make up the vast majority of the population of about 2.6 million. The result could be a current account deficit of several billion dollars annually while the crisis lasts - a drain on resources, but not a decisive one considering Doha's assets. Because of its small size and the fact that many major banks have links to the government, Qatar would probably find it easier than most countries to impose capital controls if that became necessary to prevent residents from sending large amounts of money abroad. Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at Capital Economics in London, said he did not expect the riyal's peg to break. Even Riyadh, which also fixes its currency to the dollar to maintain investor confidence and limit volatility in its oil revenues, might want to avoid driving Qatar to take that step.

The U.S. Commerce Department's regulations  hit list  recommendations follow more than three months of study and consultation with industry on ways to streamline regulations and ease burdens on manufacturing firms.  A Trump administration official with knowledge of the recommendations to be sent to the White House said the Environmental Protection Agency's complex permitting rules will be a key focus, echoing comments to Reuters by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month. The 171 public comments submitted by companies and industry groups offer a strong hint to priorities for Commerce's streamlining efforts, with numerous industry groups and firms complaining that EPA air quality permit rules for new facilities are often redundant. The report will analyze the submissions and  will identify a lot of problems and lay out ways to take responsible actions,  said the official, who declined to be identified by name. The process has looked at many regulations finalized under Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama. A common demand from industry was that the Trump administration should reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards, with several groups arguing this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for new facilities, raising costs. 3M Co (MMM.N) said other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act contained  overlapping rules, redundant requirements, conflicts between rules and undue complexity.  The National Association of Manufacturers said the EPA's review requirements for new sources of emissions such as factories can add $100,000 in costs for modeling air quality to a new facility and delay factory expansions by 18 months. It added that EPA should find ways to ease burdens for smaller projects and smaller firms. Also drawing complaints from construction groups and iron foundries is an incoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule reducing by 80 percent the amount of crystalline silica dust that can be inhaled. The dust, common on construction sites, can cause lung cancer, according to OSHA, but industry groups say reducing it to those levels will be prohibitively expensive.  To meet these much lower levels, new engineering controls and other measures will become necessary within the roofing industry,  said the National Roofing Contractors Association. Trump has already taken steps to roll back some not fully completed Obama-era environmental regulations such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants and a clean water rule greatly restricting runoff into small streams. But the Commerce list may target some rules already on the books.     We are at the outset of what we think will be a very intense deregulatory agenda from the Trump team,  said Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group.  We are concerned that they are looking to gut regulations that benefit workers and benefit consumers.  Another OSHA rule that drew industry complaints is one that further reduces worker exposure to beryllium, another potential carcinogen, that became effective on May 20 after a decade-long rulemaking effort. Manufacturing groups including auto parts makers have also targeted labor rules that make it easier for unions to organize workers, expand the number of employees eligible for overtime and govern the reporting of workplace injuries. The range of industry complaints is vast. Mining giant Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N) argued that planned EPA financial responsibility requirements for hard rock mining operations costing billions of dollars were based on inadequate study and  will have disastrous consequences for the mining industry.  Guitar maker Taylor Guitars said that permits needed from the Fish and Wildlife Service for mother-of-pearl used to decorate instruments was unnecessarily raising its costs.  This declaration requirement does not seem to serve any conservation or other purpose. The shell is not a species that is protected under law,  the company said.

The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) said in a notice state-owned enterprises (SOEs) must transfer functions that  do not match the main direction of their business development  to local authorities. The country's heavily indebted state-owned firms, most of which have been carved out of state bureaus, have been under pressure to ditch schools, hospitals, retirement homes, firefighting services and other  social functions  in order to cut costs and focus on their core businesses. The assets, which also include water supply and household sewage treatment infrastructure, as well as environmental and public health facilities, will be transferred to the government free of charge, the SASAC notice said. From 2018, no state firm will be obliged to cover the costs of  social functions  that have already been transferred to local governments, it added. China's state firms were obliged to provide lifelong employment and cradle-to-grave social welfare as part of its  iron rice bowl  system.  But with thousands of companies tottering on the brink of bankruptcy in the 1990s, the government promised it would implement reforms in order to reduce their burden.   The process has been complicated, however, with under-resourced local governments unable to afford to renovate run-down SOE-owned infrastructure or cover the health care, education and pensions of thousands of retired workers and their families, especially in  one-company towns  where the SOE was the major source of income.

Joseph Boinnet, the inspector general of the police, said in a statement that two of the suspects were Kenyans and the others were Somali nationals. Police also seized assembled explosives, four suicide vests and bomb-making materials such as TNT.  The six had been dispatched from Burhanche in Somalia by their commanders to launch attacks in Kenya,  Boinnet said. Kenyan security forces worked with their counterparts in Somalia to foil the attack and to capture the suspects. The captured men were being interrogated to establish the extent of the entire network, Boinnet said.

Fitch has also affirmed its US dollar senior unsecured notes issued by Xihui Haiwai I Investment Holdings Co., Limited (Xihui Haiwai I) at 'BBB+'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Linkage to Wuxi Municipality: WCDI's ratings are credit-linked but not equalised with Fitch's internal assessment of China's Wuxi Municipality. This is reflected in 100% state ownership, strong government oversight on its financials, and the strategic importance of the entity's operation to the government. These factors result in a high likelihood WCDI would get extraordinary support from the Wuxi authorities, if needed. Wuxi's Strong Creditworthiness: Wuxi is part of the province of Jiangsu, which is one of China's strongest economic regions in terms of gross regional product. The Wuxi municipality has a strong fiscal budget, a diversified socioeconomic profile and benefits from its strategic location as the centre of the Yangtze River Delta economic zone, one of China's top three economic zones. Legal Status Attribute Mid-Range: WCDI is registered as a state-owned limited liability company under Chinese company law. It is allowed to go bankrupt and its employees are not all civil servants. Strategic Importance Attribute Stronger: WCDI is Wuxi's major urban public infrastructure development and investment platform, and plays a very important role in implementing Wuxi's blueprint of urban development. WCDI is mandated by the government to develop municipal roads and bridges, city greening, sewage treatment of Taihu Lake and water conservancy. Control and Supervision Attribute Stronger: WCDI is wholly owned by the Wuxi government and reports to the Wuxi Department of Finance. The company's directors and senior management are appointed mainly by the government, and its major decisions need the government's approval. The company's financing plan and debt funding require government approval. Integration Attribute Stronger: WCDI's integration reflects the historical capital injection and subsidies made by the government. Since the establishment of WCDI in 2005, the company has received CNY18 billion in capital injection from the government up to the end of 2016, which represented 95% of equity. Weak Financial Profile: The company has a very high level of leverage and very low profitability because of its public welfare nature. The company's capex will stay high and it is unlikely that the company's standalone credit metrics will improve. However, with stable support from the Wuxi government, the risk has been mitigated. The notes were issued by Xihui Haiwai I, and are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Xihui International Co., Limited (Xihui International), a wholly owned subsidiary of WCDI. WCDI has granted a keepwell and liquidity support deed and a deed of equity interest purchase undertaking to ensure that Xihui International has sufficient assets and liquidity to meet its obligations under the guarantee for the notes. The notes are rated at the same level as WCDI's IDRs, given the strong link between Xihui International and WCDI, and because the keepwell and liquidity support deed and deed of equity interest purchase undertaking transfer the ultimate responsibility of payment to WCDI. RATING SENSITIVITIES A stronger support commitment from Wuxi Municipality may trigger positive rating action on WCDI. An upgrade of the internal assessment of Wuxi Municipality would result in an upgrade of WCDI. A significant weakening of WCDI's strategic importance to Wuxi, a dilution of the government's shareholding, and/or reduced explicit and implicit municipality support, may cause a downgrade. A downgrade could also stem from weaker fiscal performance or increased indebtedness of the municipality that causes our internal assessment of its creditworthiness to deteriorate.

Rescue workers, soldiers and firemen sang the national anthem and listened to speeches as three OV-10 attack aircraft darted through the cloudy sky, taking it in turns to drop bombs on areas where fighters are still holed up.  To our Muslim brothers there, we want to tell them to stop their meaningless fight because we are all Muslims,  Vice Provincial Governor Mamintal Adiong Jr. told the gathering. Flag ceremonies are normally performed twice a week, but this was the first in the mainly Muslim town since May 23, the first day of the siege, when the militants killed and abducted Christians, and torched a cathedral. Almost the entire population of about 200,000 fled from the lakeside town on the Philipppines' southernmost island of Mindanao, but beyond the checkpoints fencing it off there are still some 500-1,000 civilians trapped or being held hostage. As of Saturday the number of security forces killed in the battle for Marawi stood at 58. The death toll for civilians was 20 and more than 100 had been killed overall. The seizure of Marawi by fighters allied to Islamic State, including some from the Middle East, has alarmed Southeast Asian nations which fear the ultra-radical group - on a backfoot in Iraq and Syria - is trying to set up a stronghold on Mindanao that could threaten their region. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said on Sunday he had not expected the battle for Marawi to be as serious as it has turned out, adding it had now emerged  that Baghdadi himself, the leader of the ISIS, has specifically ordered terroristic activities here in the Philippines . Duterte did not say how he knew that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, whose movement is commonly referred to as ISIS, had given instructions for the attack on Marawi. Plan to Take Other Cities Foiled A bullet hole is seen on an abandoned hospital door, as government troops continue their assaults against the Maute group, in Marawi City, Philippines June 12, 2017.Romeo RanocoForeign Affairs Minister Allan Peter Cayetano said in an independence day speech in Manila that the militants' had planned to take over at least two or three cities in Mindanao. Their plot was foiled because troops made a preemptive raid on Marawi to capture Isnilon Hapilon, leader of the Abu Sayyaf group and Islamic State's  emir  of Southeast Asia.  We want to coordinate very well with Indonesia and Malaysia so they won't also suffer in the hands of extremists,  he said.  But the president knew at the start of his term that, as the allies become more successful in Syria and Iraq, they (Islamic State) will be looking for a land base, and Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines will be a potential target to them.  Washington said at the weekend it was providing support to the Armed Forces of the Philippines to clear the militants from pockets of Marawi. Manila said this was technical assistance and there were no U.S.  boots on the ground . A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said support included aerial surveillance and targeting, electronic eavesdropping, communications assistance and training. A U.S. P-3 Orion surveillance plane was seen over the town on Friday. The cooperation between the longtime allies in the battle is significant because Duterte, who came to power a year ago, has taken a hostile stance towards Washington and has vowed to eject U.S. military trainers and advisers from his country. The Pentagon has no permanent presence in the Philippines but for years has kept 50 to 100 special forces troops in the south of the country on rotational exercises. Duterte said on Sunday he had not sought support from Washington to end the siege and had not been aware that U.S. special forces were assisting. Cayetano said the government did not need to be involved in decisions on U.S. participation because of a bilateral visiting forces agreement and, with  events happening real time , such matters are left to the armed forces and defense department.

You just play the right way,  he said.  One bounce can change the whole game.  And so it did for Hornqvist and the now back-to-back Stanley Cup champions. The former Nashville Predator scored at 18:25 of the third period to snap a scoreless tie and lead Pittsburgh to a 2-0 win at raucous Bridgestone Arena, giving the Penguins a 4-2 series win over the Predators. In becoming the first team since the 1997-98 Detroit Red Wings to repeat as Cup champs, the Penguins did it with excellent defense and the occasional dollop of luck every title team needs. Center Sidney Crosby, who scored eight goals and dished out 19 assists in 24 playoff games, was named Conn Smythe Trophy winner as postseason most valuable player for the second straight year. Pittsburgh goalie Matt Murray stopped 27 shots for his second shutout in as many games and the fourth of his career in the postseason. He was brilliant during a 3:28 stretch of power play time by Nashville midway through the third period, coming up with four stops. Related CoveragePittsburgh Penguins - PlayerWatchNashville Predators - PlayerWatchAnd the one time Murray couldn't stop a puck from entering the net, the quick whistle of referee Kevin Pollock prevented the goal for him. Early in the second period, center Colton Sissons appeared to put the Predators on the board by poking in a loose puck from the crease. However, Pollock, working in his second Cup final, lost sight of the puck and blew his whistle. That nullified the goal and sent the sellout crowd, which by one unofficial count chucked eight catfish on the ice during the evening, into a frenzy.  Obviously, it's unfortunate, but what are you going to do? It just (stinks) that we're on the losing side of it,  Nashville defenseman P.K. Subban said. It wasn't that the Predators lacked for chances beyond the disallowed marker. Murray stoned Sissons on a breakaway later in the period, and he also denied Craig Smith on a breakaway. After Nashville misfired on its extended power play time, it nearly scored with about six minutes left. Subban teed up Sissons for a wrister in the right faceoff circle that beat Murray to the glove side but clanged off the right post. As the clock slipped under two minutes, the first overtime period of the series looked like a good possibility. Then Pittsburgh, as it often does, struck with a quick counterattack. On the tiebreaking tally, Justin Schultz's shot was wide but Hornqvist, known for his willingness to score tough goals while withstanding heavy contact, got to the puck at the goal line. From just behind the right post, he banked the puck in off of goaltender Pekka Rinne for his fifth playoff marker. Predators coach Peter Laviolette challenged the play for goalie interference, but the goal stood after a short review.  It couldn't have worked out any better for me,  Hornqvist said.  The last minute or so on the bench was very emotional for me.  Carl Hagelin sealed it with an empty-netter at 19:46, his second of the playoffs. Nashville fans, already sullen at the disallowed goal and the prospect of the Penguins celebrating on their ice, erupted in a shower of towel- and shirt-throwing disgust. Moments later, Pittsburgh players were firing gloves and helmets toward the ceiling, celebrating a hard-earned Cup. They played 25 of a possible 28 games, surviving Game 7s with the Washington Capitals and Ottawa Senators before fending off the Predators in a series that mostly lived up to expectations in spite of largely lopsided final scores.  We went through a lot of adversity and we were able to overcome each challenge thrown our way,  Murray said.  It says a lot to the character of this team that we were able to compete, no matter what bad stuff happened.  Rinne saved 27 of 28 shots but lost for just the second time in 11 postseason home games.  It's a tough feeling to watch their dream come true when you were so close to it yourself,  Nashville forward Filip Forsberg said. NOTES: Pittsburgh's 5-0 road record with a chance to clinch the Stanley Cup is the best record in NHL history in that situation. Only Montreal has won more Cups on the road with 10. ... Nashville D Ryan Ellis, who sustained an undisclosed injury in the second period of Game 5, was back in uniform and in the starting lineup for Game 6. ... Notable scratches for the Penguins were D Mark Streit, D Chad Ruhwedel and C Nick Bonino. ... Notable Predators scratches were RW PA Parenteau, LW Harry Zolnierczyk and LW Vernon Fiddler.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/hkn-penguins-predators-writethru-idUSMTZED6CF00VVF"},

The blue-chip CSI300 index ended little changed at 3,574.39 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6 percent to 3,139.88. Tech shares dropped sharply, following a sell-off on Wall Street on Friday triggered by concerns about Apple's new iPhones and a cautious Goldman Sachs report about the sector. The tech-heavy growth board ChiNext lost 1.1 percent, while the CSI TMT Index dropped 1.5 percent. Elsewhere, investors dumped cyclical stocks on views that the economic will lose momentum in the second half of the year as borrowing costs continue to rise and as regulators continue their crackdown on riskier forms of lending. UBS strategist Gao Ting said that although Chinese investors  are likely mentally prepared for short-term liquidity pressure due to financial regulations, we don't believe they pay enough attention to future economic trends.  Gao also said he expected that general credit conditions may tighten, hitting property and other investment activity, and that factory gate prices  may decline rapidly.  Echoing the view, Haitong Securities analyst Jiang Chao said that  credit tightening presents the biggest risk in the second half,  as the impact of Beijing's deleveraging campaign starts to ripple through the real economy. Also souring sentiment, major state-controlled newspapers on Monday urged the stock market regulator not to  balk or backtrack  on reforms, denting hopes that approvals of new IPOs could be suspended if the market remains weak. Bucking the trend, China Vanke hit a six-month high before ending up 4 percent, after Shenzhen Metro became the developer's largest shareholder, surpassing financial conglomerate Baoneng Group.

The site - hargapangan.id/ -  shows prices of items including rice, shallots, garlic, chilli, meat and cooking oil in 164 markets in 82 cities across the sprawling archipelago.

He said that improving data accuracy could help BI achieve its 2.5-4.5 percent annual inflation target range in 2018. Its target for this year is 3.0-5.0 percent. In the past, volatile food prices have frequently pushed Indonesia's headline inflation rate higher than the central bank's target, especially during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and when supplies are low. The government has blamed food hoarding and speculators for this trend. This year, Ramadan began in late May. Food prices have been relatively manageable, BI has said, although the headline rate was 4.33 percent in May, the highest in 14 months. May's annual food inflation rate was 3.26 percent.

The number of foreign tourists stood at 2.59 million in May, led by visitors from China, Malaysia, India, Russia and the United States, generating revenue of 125 billion baht ($3.67 billion), Pongpanu Svetarundra, the ministry's permanent-secretary, said in a statement. In the January-May period, tourist numbers rose 3.2 percent to 14.61 million, with revenue up 5.1 percent to 747 billion baht, the ministry said. The strengthening of the baht against currencies in Thailand's tourist markets, such as the dollar, the pound and the euro, might affect visitors' spending and their travel decisions to Thailand, Pongpanu said. But a stronger rouble against the baht has helped lift arrivals from Russia, he added.

The 60-year-old leader said she had tapped experience across the  whole of the Conservative Party  when she appointed Michael Gove, a long-serving cabinet minister who had clashed with May when she was home secretary, as agriculture minister. It was a surprise move - Gove was sacked as justice minister by May last year after his bid to become party leader forced now-foreign minister Boris Johnson from the race, amid accusations of treachery and political backstabbing. But after gambling away a majority in parliament in an election she did not need to call, May needs to unite a disillusioned party around her to not only support her in the Brexit talks but also to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish party that will enable her to stay in power.  What I'm doing now is actually getting on with the immediate job. And I think that's what's important, I think that's what the public would expect. They want to see government providing that certainty and stability,  she said.  What I've done today is see people from across the party accepting the invitation to be in my cabinet, and crucially I've brought in talent from across the whole of the Conservative Party. I believe that's important.  Weakened Stature May formed her cabinet despite failing to win a majority in Thursday's parliamentary election, when her Conservatives won 318 House of Commons seats. Labour, the main opposition party, won 262. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he could still be prime minister, although his party has no obvious way to build a majority coalition. He said a new election might be necessary later this year or early in 2018. Apart from Gove and her close ally Damian Green, promoted to Cabinet Office minister to oversee the day-to-day running of the government, May confirmed most of the ministers from her previous cabinet. Related CoverageFACTBOX: Key dates for UK PM May as she seeks deal to stay in powerUK Conservatives must rally behind PM May, says trade minister FoxBrexit campaigner Gove says surprised PM May asked him to join cabinetThis marked an apparent reversal of plans to turf out those considered less than loyal - a sign of her weakened stature in a party that traditionally craves strong leaders. In return, she won effusive pledges of loyalty, but she will have to sell her premiership to Conservative lawmakers at a meeting on Monday.  I am going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her too,  said Johnson, who had been touted as a possible successor to May. Liam Fox, trade minister, also said that May was the only person to take Britain out of the European Union. Keeping Enemies Close The political turmoil comes a week before Britain is due to start negotiating the terms of its exit from the European Union in talks of unprecedented complexity that are supposed to wrap up by the end of March 2019, when Britain actually leaves. That timeline now looks even more ambitious than before, not least because May's electoral debacle has emboldened those within her own party who object to her  hard Brexit  approach of leaving the European single market and customs union. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves after a church service in Sonning, Britain June 11, 2017.Stefan WermuthA Conservative source said the move to include Gove in her cabinet may suggest she has learnt a lesson after firing George Osborne, the former finance minister who as editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper, has become a vocal critic.  Theresa May is a dead woman walking. It's just how long she's going to remain on death row,  Osborne told the BBC. The move might offer hope to Conservative lawmakers who have criticized her style of government. Several have said that she seeks to concentrate too much power in her immediate circle, leaving her cabinet and parliament powerless. Two of her closest aides, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, who had been the focus of some criticism, resigned on Saturday.  We are going to see, I hope, more collective decision-making in the cabinet. I and other senior colleagues have made that clear to her,  said defense minister Michael Fallon. Slideshow (18 Images)Dup Deal May's only hope of forming a government now is to win support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats. She is seeking a so-called confidence and supply deal, which would involve the DUP supporting the Conservatives on key votes but not joining a formal coalition. The DUP does not work or negotiate on Sundays for religious reasons, but officials from both sides are due to meet on Monday, and DUP leader Arlene Foster told Sky News she would meet May on Tuesday. Senior Conservative lawmaker Graham Brady said the prospect of being propped up by the socially conservative DUP, which is strongly focused on Northern Ireland's specific political complexities, was causing concern in his party.  I think there is concern about the policies of the DUP, the domestic policies in Northern Ireland, but I think it's pretty clear that any arrangement that is reached is not going to be a full coalition,  he told BBC Radio. The DUP is strongly opposed to single-sex marriage and abortion, at odds with Conservative policies. There are also concerns about the potential impact of the proposed arrangement on Northern Ireland's peace agreement, which relies in part on London being an impartial arbiter between those, such as the DUP, who want the province to remain in the United Kingdom and those who want it to be part of Ireland. Even if a deal is struck, May could struggle to get backing from parliament for her Brexit stance. Fallon told the BBC the government would be able to muster parliamentary support for its Brexit plans, adding:  Our view of Brexit I don't think has changed.  But Anna Soubry, a Conservative member of parliament who campaigned ahead of last year's referendum for Britain to stay in the EU, disagreed.  I don't think she does have a majority in the House of Commons for leaving the single market,  she told Sky News.

The Queen, as she has done for over six decades, agreed with her prime minister.  May returned to Downing Street where, looking calm and fresh after a hard night, announced that she plannedÂ to form a government to âlead Britain forward at this critical time for our country.â   What the country needs more than ever is certainty,âÂ she said, âand having secured the largest number of votes and the greatest number of seats in the general election, it is clear that only the Conservative & Unionist Party has the legitimacy and ability to provide that certainty by commanding a majority in the House of Commons.âÂ Â  Not a word in the speech about the drop in the Conservative vote, nor of a campaign, commanded by herself and her aides, which failed to ignite and certainly nothing on the strong increase in the Labor vote led by Jeremy Corbyn, a man she has mocked incessantly since she took office.  She will stay, establish a government (with âour friends and allies in the Democratic Unionist Partyâ of Northern Ireland) and then âguide the country through the crucial Brexit talks that begin in just 10 days.â Her first negotiation, pre-Brexit, will be with a party she hardly knows that has said it will bargain hard for a good deal. She needs them too much to fail, but the dealâs not signed yet.  MORE FROM REUTERS Election debacle for UK government Unusual moments from a turbulent election Exclusive: Trump targets illegal immigrants Commentary: How Comey's smoking gun could kill the Trump presidency May has shown remarkable coolness in the aftermath of what the media were already screaming to be a disaster. Wholly in tune with a woman with an aversion to populist gestures, an insatiable appetite for work, papers, practicalities.Â   And in this she was right. She must stay on, must form a government which can frame a negotiating strategy, must calm the febrile political atmosphere, And since that was the right thing to do, she seems to have thought, best do it without a display either ofÂ  disappointment or false humility. Out of step with todayâs demand, especially in the media, for contrition, apology and even tears. But thatâs the way she is.  For all her cool, the result was a blow, with large consequences. As with the surprise Brexit vote a year ago and the election of President Donald Trump last November, this election saw an apparent no-hoper, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader - a man who forÂ all of his political lifeÂ has supported far left, even militant movements,Â consistently voted against his party and bitterly opposed the EU and NATO - come close to winning. His reconstruction of himself as an amiableÂ man who had spoken to groups like Hamas only in the interests of achieving peace was a media triumph.  For the UK, a dreary season of uncertainty, weak government and political maneuvering is certain. The resultsÂ Â showedÂ Conservatives winning 318 seats in a House of Commons where 326 seats are needed for the barest of majorities. They are the winners and losers at the same time - in the lead, but not in power.Â Labour, with 262 seats, is similarly a loser and winner at the same time: in second place, but with a result much better than expected.  Most of the other parties - Liberal Democrats (12 seats), Scottish Nationalists (35), Welsh Nationalists (4) and the Greens (1) - are broadly liberal-leftist and anti-Brexit. They could form part of a âprogressive coalition,â an outcome which Labour supporters and members of Parliament were proposing as the results became clear.Â   If the Conservatives can count on the 10 seats won in Northern Ireland by the Democratic Unionist Party, they would have aÂ fragile majority.Â Indeed, Northern Ireland might save Mayâs Conservatives in another way if the republican party Sinn Fein follows party policy by not taking up their seven seats. This will give a slightly plumper cushion to a Tory majority.  May, a leader much diminished, must now bear the burden of entrenching a majority able to confront the larger challenge of negotiating Brexit before - probably inevitably - she will go,Â either through her own resignation or a successful challenge from a party colleague. Boris Johnson, the jaunty foreign secretary, is the bookmakersâ favorite. If they are right, President Trump will have a competitor for scandal headlines.  The Brexit discussions are due to startÂ onÂ June 19. Â   When and if that happens, those, mainly in the Conservative party, who want as complete a break as possible with the EU, will find they are much weakened. This was a complex result: the Conservative vote actually increased, even as seats fell, which did not cancel out the pro-Brexit referendum of last June. But it is likely to mean that Britain will now seek a softer exit taking back government powers from the EU while still trying to retain access to the single market.  For that, there will need to be a deal on the free movement of labor within the Union - one of the main reasons a majority of the British voted to leave. The EU negotiators would be wise to focus on that. Not to force the U.K. to take it or leave it, but to discover how much the other 27 EU states wish to retain free movement, and how far they wish to modify it. For that, too, there may be a deal.  Politics no longer takes place in smoke-filled rooms, since tobacco, alas, is banned everywhere. But in the cleaner air of Brussels, London, Berlin, Paris and elsewhere, the future of the UK, the EU, and even NATO, will need to be hammered out one more time.

In the short term, she could yet manage it. But the longer-term consequences may well be disastrous for her country.  Negotiations on the U.Kâs exit from the European Union are scheduled to begin on June 19âless than two weeks away. In the aftermath of Thursdayâs shock result, many assumed May would stand down, perhaps allowing in a new leader from her Conservative party. European leaders had already signaled they might be willing to rework the timetable if the opposition Labour Party won, and would probably have done the same under the current circumstances.  Instead, May seems keen to push ahead with the discussions. Itâs a toxic dynamic that will likely make any kind of deal all but impossible.  During the election campaign, May repeatedly talked up the dangers of a âcoalition of chaosâ if the opposition Labour Party were able to become the largest party. With shameless speed, however, she has negotiated herself into partnership with Northern Irelandâs Democratic Unionist Party, giving her a slim majority in parliament. Itâs a brilliant, Machiavellian move, leaving her â for the moment at least â surprisingly unassailable.  Itâs hard to imagine there are many people outside her closest circle in Downing Street who genuinely believe May is the right choice right now. But that may not matter. During the campaign, she said she prided herself on sometimes being a âbloody difficult woman.â At the time, she was talking up her ability to negotiate with Europe. Now she is facing down all comers, from her own party and beyond.  RELATED COVERAGE May pledges to form a new government Video: Election deals May a crushing blow EU fears Brexit delay It might feel like an affront to democracy, but the truth is that the prime minister is still the leader of Britainâs largest political party, and she has found an ideological ally willing to back her. The government she has formed could hardly be more out of touch with an electorate that has moved sharply to the left. There is little sign she cares.  There will be no shortage of figures in her Conservative Party who would like to bring her down â they have clearly been furiously briefing the media ever since the election results started coming in. A leadership challenge is possible â but far from inevitable.  Former Chancellor George Osborne, perhaps the most likely to do so, stood down from Parliament this election to edit the London Evening Standard. Other potential rivals such as Chancellor Philip Hammond remain within her government, and have so far mostly said little in public either before or after the election.  German Chancellor Angela Merkelâs office on Friday declined immediate comment on the election results. But it already seems likely that May will be moving toward a uniquely adversarial relationship with her continental partners.  Merkel and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, after all, increasingly define themselves in their opposition to the far right in general and U.S. President Donald Trump in particular. May, by contrast, has openly cozied up to Trump and based her unsuccessful electoral campaign on drawing votes from the anti-European UK Independence Party.  Presumably May is still intending to stick with the team she chose before the election to negotiate Brexit. Led by pugnacious Euroskeptic David Davis, it also includes Trade Minister Liam Fox and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Itâs hard to imagine a group more likely to unnecessarily antagonize those they are supposed to be dealing with.  MORE FROM REUTERS COLUMNISTS Commentary: How Comey's 'smoking gun' could kill the Trump presidency Commentary: Calm down, America. Attacks won't break Britain. Commentary: Merkel is wrong about Trump and Brexit May will also now have to take into account the wishes of her DUP ally, an unapologetically right-wing Christian party with anti-EU tendencies but a desire to see EU money continue flowing to Northern Ireland. Her premiership is dependent on their continued support, and this will make negotiations more complex still.  While she has generally gone out of her way to be vague on what she means by Brexit, the general assumption within Britain is that May wants to renegotiate freedom of movement and migration between Europe and the UK. The cost of that  hard  Brexit is likely to be Britain leaving the European single market, something that could bring with it extremely difficult economic consequences.  In the June 8 election, voters appeared lukewarm about that concept. But May could well choose to pursue it anyway. Sheâs unlikely to find much support from her European counterparts, however â indeed, they may have a vested interest in making sure negotiations fail. Europe has little enthusiasm for countries being able to leave the EU, and the patience of EU officials with Britain was already running thin.  Britain still has cards to play: it remains a major player in European defense within NATO, for example. Its relationship with the United States is also important, although in the era of Donald Trump that more a double-edged sword. Itâs also unclear how May will now be viewed by the U.S. president, notorious for not wanting to associate with those who look weak.  Not all of these problems would be solved by May standing aside for a new Tory leader â or perhaps even Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the unlikely event that he is able to form a broader loose alliance with other progressive parties. But they are all intensified by May keeping herself in office.  Things may work out, of course. Itâs just conceivable that May could deliver a Brexit success â whatever that means â and win back her shattered credibility without losing power.  If that doesnât happen, however, neither she nor her party will be forgiven by the country for a very long time.  (Peter Apps is Reuters global affairs columnist.

Inflation in India is expected to have cooled to a new record low of 2.60 percent in May, a Reuters poll found, which could add pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates later in the year. Asian markets were also lower - with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.8 percent - as shares of electronic products makers fell on caution ahead of the Fed, which is expected to raise rates and signal further increases this year.  The market has been moving up for quite sometime and it needs to consolidate,  said Arun Kejriwal, founder of Kejriwal Research & Investment Services, adding that the fall in banking and IT stocks was owing to profit booking.

It is neither healthy nor desirable for a president who gathered only 24 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidentials and who was elected in the second round only by the rejection of the extreme right should benefit from a monopoly of national representation,  said Socialist party leader Jean-Christophe Cambadelis as results flowed in. Cambadelis later confirmed he had been eliminated from the competition for his Paris seat, one that was previously a safe one for the Socialists. It will be contested in next Sunday's second round by Mounir Mahjoubi, the youngest minister in Macron's new government, and hard-left candidate Sarah Legrain. Francois Baroin, who ran the campaign of conservative party The Republicans, echoed these sentiments, saying political power should not be concentrated in the hands of one party and urging supporters to turn out on June 18 for the decisive second round. Like other senior politicians from established parties not connected with Macron's meteoric rise to power, Baroin also bemoaned the low turnout, which at around 49 percent was the lowest first round showing since the Fifth Republic was born in 1958.  Today fewer than half of French people expressed a preference,  he said.  This record level of abstention... bears witness to the continuing fractures in French society... They are neither forgotten nor wiped away.  Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Front (FN) who spoke after she qualified for the June 18 second round of voting, called the huge abstention rate worrying and, like Baroin, called on supporters to turn out in a week's time.  There needs to be in parliament lawmakers who will really oppose the disastrous policies Emmanuel Macron is preparing,  Le Pen said, urging voters to mobilise to ensure the FN wins seats. She won a fifth of the vote in the first round of the presidential election in April, coming second behind Macron by just a few percentage points of the vote, yet pollsters expect she will have just a handful of seats in parliament in contrast to 400 or more for Macron. Responding to the criticism, a senior party official of Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) party said there would be no riding roughshod over alternative views.  We shall be very respectful of the opposition... There has to be respect for minorities in a debate. This will not be a dominant majority but a responsible majority, said Jean-Paul Delevoye, who was in charge of selecting LREM candidates. Jean-Luc Melenchon, a far-left candidate who also scored well in the presidentials, said Macron had won a  circumstantial majority.  He had campaigned on a platform of protecting workers rights in contrast to Macron's plan for business-friendly reforms.  The huge abstention rate shows that there is no majority in this country in favour of destroying the labour code, nor for reducing liberties, nor for ecological irresponsibility, nor to pander to the rich - all things that figure in the president's programme.

A Reuters poll showed that while markets have priced in a 25-basis point rise in rates, investors' will be looking for any fresh hints on the pace of further tightening and for details on its plans for trimming its balance sheet. Mixed U.S. economic data and lower inflation expectations have created a division of opinion.      The market will be more focused on the dot plot and whether or not it will show a more gradual rate hike trajectory, and if that's the case, then it will be more positive for Asian currencies appetite post Fed,  said Chang Wei Liang, FX strategist at Mizuho Bank.     Markets will also be looking out for any guidance on the vanishing normalisation policy from the FOMC meeting, Chang added, saying that at the moment, the Asian currency markets are in a wait-and-see mode.     The Fed concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday, and the outcome will affect trade in early Asia on Thursday.      The dollar had risen against a basket of currencies on Friday, helped by a sharp drop in the British pound after surprise results of the UK parliamentary elections. On Monday, though, sterling gained, buoyed by Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to unite her party.     Among regional currencies, the South Korean won was 0.2 percent lower, after South Korea's central bank chief said on Monday that the bank will maintain its current record-low interest rate of 1.25 percent as uncertainties remain high and as inflationary pressure is weak.     Meanwhile, the Taiwan dollar was on track to post its fifth straight session of losses on Monday, down 0.1 percent.      The Taiwan economy, which is dependent on tech exports to the United States, took a beating with the local semiconductor index falling 1.8 percent, as U.S. tech stocks tumbled on Friday.     But analysts say it doesn't reflect any fundamental shift in terms of demand for tech products and, therefore, any spillover on Asian currencies isn't going to be large and will probably be transitory.     Philippine and Malaysia markets were closed for local holidays.      INDIAN RUPEE     The Indian rupee was 0.1 percent lower ahead of consumer price inflation (CPI) data for May, scheduled for later in the day.     Inflation in India is expected to have cooled to a record low in May, a Reuters poll showed, which could add pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates later in the year.     Mizuho Bank said in a note that weak May CPI data could set off rupee strength amid buying in bonds driven by bets on imminent easing.         SINGAPORE DOLLAR     The Singapore dollar was up 0.1 percent, but was not seen to be affected by data showing retail sales growth at 9-month highs.     Singapore's retail sales in April rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, data from the Singapore Department of Statistics, showed on Monday, its best growth since July 2016.      Analysts said the data would not likely have any implications on the central bank's policy stance. In April, the Monetary Authority of Singapore warned of  significant policy uncertainty  globally, signalling a reluctance to tighten anytime soon.

Rupee forwards were active, with spot-next forwards trading at 152.80/85 per dollar at 0539 GMT, slightly firmer from Friday's close of 152.85/90.  There are some inward remittances and not much of (importer) demand,  a currency dealer said, requesting anonymity. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank governor last month said the bank would allow gradual depreciation of the currency. The central bank has set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year. The spot rupee, which the central bank had fixed at 152.50 since May 5, did not trade on Monday. Foreign investors bought a net 1.37 billion rupees ($8.98 million) worth of government securities in the week ended June 7. They have sold a net 39.96 billion rupees worth of securities so far this year. Trading was dull as investors assessed the extent of damage to the economy from the recent floods and landslides. The country's main agricultural crops - tea and rubber - were hit by the worst torrential rains in 14 years. Damage to agricultural exports would put pressure on the rupee, currency dealers said. However, they added there was some optimism over expected inflows in the form of international assistance that could help offset potential downward pressure on the local currency. While the inflows are likely to help the rupee, the central bank would have to tighten interest rates to curb unnecessary credit growth and inflationary pressure, they said. The floods could hurt overall economic growth and also widen the government's budget deficit with high infrastructure spending. Sri Lankan shares were trading 0.07 percent weaker at 6,664.47, as of 0610 GMT.

The best way to do that, he says, is to cut out humans. About 200 nuclear reactors around the world will be shut down over the next quarter century, mostly in Europe, according to the International Energy Agency. That means a lot of work for the half a dozen companies that specialize in the massively complex and dangerous job of dismantling plants. Those firms â including Areva (AREVA.PA), Rosatom's Nukem Technologies Engineering Services, and Toshiba's (6502.T) Westinghouse â are increasingly turning away from humans to do this work and instead deploying robots and other new technologies.  That is transforming an industry that until now has mainly relied on electric saws, with the most rapid advances being made in the highly technical area of dismantling a reactor's core â the super-radioactive heart of the plant where the nuclear reactions take place. The transformation of the sector is an engineering one, but companies are also looking to the new technology to cut time and costs in a competitive sector with slim margins. Dismantling a nuclear power plant can take decades and cost up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), depending on its size and age. The cost of taking apart the plant in Muelheim-Kaerlich will be about 800 million euros, according to sources familiar with the station's economics. Some inroads have already been made: a programmable robot arm developed by Areva has reduced the time it takes to dismantle some of the most contaminated components of a plant by 20-30 percent compared with conventional cutting techniques. For Areva and rival Westinghouse, reactor dismantling is unlikely to make an impact on the dire financial straits they are mired in at present as it represents just a small part of their businesses, which are dominated by plant-building. But it nonetheless represents a rare area of revenue growth; the global market for decommissioning services is expected to nearly double to $8.6 billion by 2021, from $4.8 billion last year, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets. Such growth could prove important for the two companies should they weather their current difficulties.   We're not talking about the kind of margins Apple is making on its iPhone,  said Thomas Eichhorn, head of Areva's German dismantling activities.  But it's a business with a long-term perspective.  When reactors were built in the 1970s, they were designed to keep radiation contained inside at all costs, with little thought given to those who might be tearing them down more than 40 years later. First, engineers need to remove the spent nuclear fuel rods stored in reactor buildings â but only after they've cooled off. At Muelheim-Kaerlich this took about two years in total. Then peripheral equipment such as turbines need to be removed, a stage Muelheim-Kaerlich has begun and which can take several years. Finally, the reactor itself needs to be taken apart and the buildings demolished, which takes about a decade. Some of the most highly contaminated components are cocooned in concrete and placed in iron containers that will be buried deep underground at some point.  Robots Under Water  While the more mundane tasks, including bringing down the plants' outer walls, are left to construction groups such as Hochtief (HOTG.DE), it's the dismantling of the reactor's core where more advanced skills matter â and where the use of technology has advanced most in recent years. Enter companies such as Areva, Westinghouse, Nukem Technologies, GE Hitachi (GE.N) (6501.T) as well as GNS, owned by Germany's four nuclear plant operators. They have all begun using robots and software to navigate their way into the reactor core, or pressure vessel.  The most difficult task is the dismantling of the reactor pressure vessel, where the remaining radioactivity is highest,  said Volmar, who took charge of the RWE-owned (RWEG.DE) Muelheim-Kaerlich plant two years ago.  We leave this to a specialized expert firm.          A Worker in the nuclear reactor of the nuclear power plant that will be dismantled in Muelheim-Kaerlich, Germany, May 22, 2017.Thilo SchmuelgenThe vessel â which can be as high as 13 meters and weigh up to 700 tonnes â is hidden deep inside the containment building that is shaped like a sphere to ensure its 30-centimetre thick steel wall is evenly strained in case of an explosion. The 2011 Fukushima disaster and the Chernobyl accident of 1986 are imprinted in the world's consciousness as examples of the catastrophic consequences of the leakage of radioactive material. France's Areva recently won the contract to dismantle the pressure vessel internals at Vattenfall's 806 megawatt (MW) Brunsbuettel nuclear plant in Germany, which includes an option for the Swedish utility's 1,402 MW Kruemmel site. There, the group will for the first time use its new AZURo programmable robot arm. It hopes this will help it outstrip rivals in what is the world's largest dismantling market following Germany's decision to close all its last nuclear plants by 2022, in response to the Fukushima disaster. AZURo operates under water because the liquid absorbs radiation from the vessel components â reducing the risk of leakage and contamination of the surrounding area. The chamber is flooded before its work begins. Slideshow (18 Images)Areva's German unit invests about 5 percent of its annual sales, or about 40 million euros, in research and development, including in-house innovation such as AZURo. By comparison, the world's 1,000 largest corporate R&D; spenders, on average, spent 4.2 percent last year, according to PwC. The robot arm technology helped Areva beat Westinghouse by winning tenders to dismantle pressure vessel internals at EnBW's (EBKG.DE) Philippsburg 2 and Gundremmingen 2 blocks, industry sources familiar with the matter said. Areva and EnBW both declined to comment. Westinghouse â whose U.S. business filed for bankruptcy in March â did not respond to repeated requests for comment.  Time and Money Britain's OC Robotics has built the LaserSnake2, a flexible 4.5-metre snake arm, which can operate in difficult spaces and uses a laser to increase cutting speeds â thus reducing the risk of atmospheric contamination. It was tested at the Sellafield nuclear site in west Cumbria last year. This followed France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), whose laser-based dismantling technology generates fewer radioactive aerosols â a key problem during cutting â than other technologies. The complexity of the dismantling process is also giving rise to modeling software that maps out the different levels of radiation on plant parts, making it easier to calculate the most efficient sequence of dismantling â the more contaminated parts are typically dealt with first â and gives clarity over what safety containers will be needed to store various components. GNS, which is jointly owned by E.ON (EONGn.DE), RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall, is currently helping to dismantle the German Neckarwestheim 1 and Philippsburg 1 reactors, using its software to plan the demolition. The company also hopes to supply its software services for the dismantling of PreussenElektra's Isar 1 reactor, which is being tendered, and aims to expand to other European countries.  Two things matter: time and money,  said Joerg Viermann, head of sales of waste management activities at GNS.   The less I have to cut, the sooner I will be done and the less I will spend.

The South Asian nation is still carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last year's record harvest as exports were hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments. Another bumper harvest could accelerate the price slide and stoke discontent among farmers that has triggered protests in the big agrarian states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where police shot dead five protesting farmers this week. Three years into his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains popular and has no credible challenger. Yet unrest has flared in states ruled by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), catching regional leaders flat-footed and providing a reality check on Modi's promise to double farmers' incomes over the next five years.  The next year will be challenging for the government in ensuring farmers get decent realisation,  said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai. Farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are demanding better prices for their produce and billions of dollars in debt relief after the new BJP government in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, recently announced a $5.6 billion loan write-off for farmers. Yet experts say such loan waivers amount to quick fixes that cannot compensate for flaws in farm policies, which have encouraged higher production of crops previously in short supply but offered scant protection on prices. Many farm commodities are trading below support prices set by the government. That is because the government only commits serious sums to buying wheat and rice, but not other crops that enrich the diet of India's 1.3 billion people. Prices will fall further unless exports are revived, said Galipelli, adding  production has jumped but local demand hasn't risen in the same proportion . Ample world supply is likely to persist, predicts agribusiness giant Cargill Inc.  There is no export parity right now. Even after the recent correction in oilmeal prices, Indian supplies are expensive,  said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA), a Mumbai-based trade body. Indian grains production reached an all-time high of 273.38 million tonnes in the latest crop year, on record output of rice, wheat, oilseeds and pulses. But exports failed to revive, depressing local prices of corn < NMZc1>, wheat, soybean and turmeric. Exports of key farm commodities fell by a quarter in 2015/16 to $16.07 billion due to drought, and failed to revive in 2016/17 despite the recovery in output. Rural Distress A rising population, shrinking farm plots and increasing indebtedness among farmers have all hit India's vast rural hinterlands. Farming accounts for 14 percent of gross domestic product - down from 47 percent at independence 70 years ago. Nearly a third of rural households are in debt, owing an average of more than 100,000 rupees ($1,560). Many farmers lack access to formal credit, forcing them to borrow dearly from money lenders or relatives. To mitigate this distress, state and central governments have ramped up purchases of red chilli, turmeric, corn, onion, sunflower, pigeon peas and groundnut from farmers. Still, farmers such as Sanjay Shinde from Maharashtra's Nashik district are unhappy.  If Uttar Pradesh can waive all farmers' debts, then why not Maharashtra?  he asked. Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances.  It is a path that we need to tread very carefully,  he said this week. Analysts and traders say good monsoon rains - forecast at 98 percent of the long-term average - will only complicate matters unless supplies are adequately managed.  There is an urgent need to restrict imports and promote exports. That's how one can bring down the inventory level of food grains,  says Nitin Kalantri, a miller at Latur in Maharashtra.  Otherwise in the next season we will have much a bigger problem. And much bigger farmers' protests.

Upton jacked a grand slam and drove in five runs as the Detroit Tigers avoided a three-game sweep with an 8-3 rout of the Boston Red Sox on Sunday night. Norris (3-4) had made one prior appearance at Fenway Park, as a reliever, and it too was memorable. Norris struck out the only batter he faced -- Red Sox slugger David Ortiz -- on Sept. 5, 2014. On Sunday, Norris gave up two runs on seven hits and three walks while striking out six over five innings.  Sure, in a perfect game I don't go (only) five innings. I'd like to go six, seven, eight,  Norris said.  But you want to look at the positives. We won. I gave up a couple runs, limited damage.  Upton's grand slam was the fifth of his career and his team-leading 13th home run. The ball sailed approximately 344 feet and clanged off Pesky's Pole in right field with one out in the fifth inning. Related CoverageDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchHis last grand slam came as a member of the San Diego Padres on May 24, 2015, against the Los Angeles Dodgers.  I thought I hit it hard enough that it would run out of time to curve,  Upton said.  Take them how you can get them.  Nicholas Castellanos added a two-run homer, his eight of the year, and Ian Kinsler also had an RBI for Detroit (30-32), which snapped a three-game losing streak. Hanley Ramirez, Dustin Pedroia and Christian Vazquez each drove in a run for Boston (34-28). The Red Sox outscored the Tigers 16-6 in winning the first two games of the series. Drew Pomeranz (6-3) took the loss to snap a career-best, three-start winning streak. He allowed six runs (five earned) on eight hits and two walks with two strikeouts in 4 1/3 innings.  It's a matter of just more consistent execution,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said of Pomeranz.  I don't have anything else today but that. He's shown the ability to do it.  Detroit struck for three runs in the first inning against a shaky Pomeranz. With a man on base, Castellanos blasted a 2-0 Pomeranz fastball roughly 448 feet into the Green Monster seats in left-center field in the game's second at-bat for a 2-0 lead. Upton's two-out, opposite-field single drove in another run for the Tigers. Ramirez's hard-hit RBI single got a run back with two outs in the Boston first. Pedroia's one-out RBI double in the third brought the Red Sox within a run. Pomeranz escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fourth inning but walked the bases full again in the fifth, leading Farrell to take him out in favor of reliever Heath Hembree. One batter later, Upton unloaded on a 96 mph fastball from Hembree for his grand slam.  Felt like it was a chance to try to get a matchup,  Farrell said of his move to Hembree.  Didn't work out. The five runs ends up being quite a difference in this one tonight. Said Pomeranz:  You get out of the first bases-loaded (situation) and then I get taken out in the next bases-loaded one. Obviously, I want to get out of all of those situations and stay in there and stay in the game as long as I can, but it's part of the game.  Kinsler's RBI single after Upton's homer capped Detroit's five-run fifth. Vazquez's run-scoring single in the sixth cut the Red Sox's deficit to 8-3. Boston loaded the bases for Chris Young with two outs in the ninth, but he lined out to shortstop to end the 4-hour, 6-minute game.

Lying on the Gulf of Oman along the approaches to the Straits of Hormuz, the port of Chabahar is central to India's hopes to crack open a transport corridor to Central Asia and Afghanistan that bypasses arch-rival Pakistan. India committed $500 million to speed development of the port after sanctions on Iran were lifted following a deal struck between major powers and Tehran to curb its nuclear programme in 2015. But the state-owned Indian firm that is developing Chabahar is yet to award a single tender for supplying equipment such as cranes and forklifts, according to two government sources tracking India's biggest overseas infrastructure push. U.S. President Donald Trump denounced the nuclear agreement on the campaign trail, and since taking office in January has accused Iran of being a threat to countries across the Middle East. Swiss engineering group Liebherr and Finland's Konecranes and Cargotec have told India Ports Global Pvt Ltd, which is developing the deep water port, they were unable to take part in the bids as their banks were not ready to facilitate transactions involving Iran due to the uncertainty over U.S. policy, the two officials said in separate conversations with Reuters. These firms dominate the market for customised equipment to develop jetties and container terminals. One official said the first tender was floated in September, but attracted few bidders because of the fear of renewed sanctions. That fear has intensified since January.  Now the situation is that we are running after suppliers,  one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of matter. A Konecranes spokeswoman declined to comment beyond confirming the company was not involved in the project. Cargotec and Liebherr did not respond to requests for comment. Some tenders have been floated three times since September because they failed to attract bidders. A Chinese firm, ZPMC, has since come forward to supply some equipment, the same Indian official said. Threat of Sanctions Trump has called the agreement between Iran and six major world powers restricting Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for lifting of sanctions  the worst deal ever negotiated . Last month his administration extended relief on Washington's broadest and most punitive sanctions, while carrying out a wider policy review on how to deal with the Islamic Republic. Uncertainty over U.S. policy is already causing long delays in contracts that Iran has sought with international firms to develop its oil fields and buy planes for its ageing airlines. The lifting of United Nations and European Union sanctions in 2016 partly reconnected Iran with the international financial system crucial to trade. But large international bankers with exposure to the United States remain unwilling to facilitate Iranian deals for fear of running afoul of narrower, unilateral U.S. sanctions that remain outside the nuclear deal and uncertainty over whether wider sanctions relief will continue. India's ambassador to Iran said the process of procuring equipment for the Chabahar port was under way and that some of the customised cranes needed take up to 20 months to build. The banking situation was slowing improving, he added.  Tenders are re-floated for a variety of reasons including technical specifications not being met, etc. Banking channels, in recent months, have in fact somewhat eased,  Saurabh Kumar said in an emailed response to Reuters from Tehran.  If some companies do not participate, it really is their business.  India has been pushing for the development of Chabahar port for more than a decade as a hub for its trade links to the resource-rich countries of central Asia and Afghanistan. Access to those countries is currently complicated by India's fraught relationship with Pakistan. Bureaucratic delays, difficult negotiations with Iran and the risk of incurring Washington's displeasure during the financial embargo in Tehran had meant there was little progress on the port until now. But, prodded in part by China's development of Gwadar port, which lies barely 100 km (60 miles) from Chabahar on the Pakistani coast, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has unveiled massive investment plans centred around the Iranian port, offering to help build railways, roads and fertiliser plants that could eventually amount to $15 billion. So far, even an initial credit line of $150 million that India wants to extend to Iran for development of Chabahar has remained a non-starter as Tehran has not been able to do its part of work.  They have not sought the loan from us because they haven't awarded the tenders, either because of lack of participation or banking problems,  said the second government official. Ambassador Kumar said the Iran had indicated it would be sending proposals shortly to tap the credit line. Meena Singh Roy, who heads the West Asia centre at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, a New Delhi think-tank, said increasing tension between Washington and Tehran would have an impact on the port project.  The Chabahar Project has strategic significance for India,  she said.  However ... nothing much seems to be moving due to new uncertainties in the region.

Qatari finance minister Ali Sherif al-Emadi, in one of the first detailed public responses of a Qatari economic official to the crisis, told CNBC television that the economy was essentially operating as normal and Doha could easily defend its currency. Also, many investors are still hoping for a diplomatic solution in coming weeks. Doha is ready to listen to the concerns of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait said on Sunday, as it tried to mediate a solution.

He added that the countries which had imposed sanctions would also lose money because of the damage to business in the region.  A lot of people think we're the only ones to lose in this... If we're going to lose a dollar, they will lose a dollar also.  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties a week ago, accusing Doha of backing terrorism. The sanctions have disrupted flows of imports and other materials into Qatar and caused many foreign banks to scale back their business with the country. But Emadi said the energy sector and economy of the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter were essentially operating as normal and that there had not been a serious impact on supplies of food or other goods. Qatar can import goods from Turkey, the Far East or Europe and it will respond to the crisis by diversifying its economy even more, he told CNBC. The Qatari riyal has come under pressure in the spot and forward foreign exchange markets, but Emadi said neither this nor a near 10 percent plunge in the local stock market was cause for concern.  Our reserves and investment funds are more than 250 percent of gross domestic product, so I don't think there is any reason that people need to be concerned about what's happening or any speculation on the Qatari riyal.  Asked whether Qatar might need to raise money by selling off stakes in large Western companies held by its sovereign wealth fund, Emadi indicated this was not on the cards at present.  We are extremely comfortable with our positions, our investments and liquidity in our systems,  he said. Prices of Qatar's international bonds have dropped sharply, but in answer to another question, Emadi said he saw no need for the government to step into the market and buy those bonds to support prices.

He added that the countries which had imposed sanctions would also lose money because of the damage to business in the region.  A lot of people think we're the only ones to lose in this... If we're going to lose a dollar, they will lose a dollar also.  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties a week ago, accusing Doha of backing terrorism. The sanctions have disrupted flows of imports and other materials into Qatar and caused many foreign banks to scale back their business with the country. But Emadi said the energy sector and economy of the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter were essentially operating as normal and that there had not been a serious impact on supplies of food or other goods. Qatar can import goods from Turkey, the Far East or Europe and it will respond to the crisis by diversifying its economy even more, he told CNBC. The Qatari riyal has come under pressure in the spot and forward foreign exchange markets, but Emadi said neither this nor a near 10 percent plunge in the local stock market was cause for concern.  Our reserves and investment funds are more than 250 percent of gross domestic product, so I don't think there is any reason that people need to be concerned about what's happening or any speculation on the Qatari riyal.  Asked whether Qatar might need to raise money by selling off stakes in large Western companies held by its sovereign wealth fund, Emadi indicated this was not on the cards at present.  We are extremely comfortable with our positions, our investments and liquidity in our systems,  he said. Prices of Qatar's international bonds have dropped sharply, but in answer to another question, Emadi said he saw no need for the government to step into the market and buy those bonds to support prices.

Moon made a lengthy speech at the National Assembly to explain why the economy needed a boost in fiscal spending of  11.2 trillion won ($9.95 billion) in the second half of this year, which is aimed at creating 71,000 public sector jobs and 15,000 private sector jobs.  If we leave our current jobless situation as is, there are concerns it may later return to us as an economic crisis equaling a national catastrophe,  said Moon in an unprecedented call for an extra budget. His parliamentary address is the first ever on an extra budget by a president, underscoring his commitment to his job-creation agenda. Moon, who won a May election, promised to create 810,000 public sector jobs within his single five-year term, hoping to resolve soaring youth unemployment hovering near a record high of 11.2 percent as of April this year.  Both parties in the conservative opposition - the Liberty Korea Party and the Bareun Party - have opposed the proposed extra budget, posing a challenge to Moon's ruling Democratic Party in passing the bill as it needs the support of more than 30 opposition lawmakers. Moon's party only holds 40 percent of the 299 seats in the National Assembly.  In his speech, Moon also said income inequality was worsening in Asia's fourth largest economy, and the government can help to resolve it if the National Assembly approved the extra budget designed to boost jobs and household income.  About 8.8 trillion won of the extra budget will be financed by excess tax revenue expected this year, while the remaining 2.4 trillion will come from government revenue left over from 2016 and public funds managed by state-owned companies.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in delivers a speech at the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea June 12, 2017.Ahn Young-joon/PoolThe supplementary budget will add to the 400.5 trillion won budget for 2017 that was approved by the National Assembly late last year.  Separately, the central bank said monetary policy needed to stay accommodative to support the economy, but adjustments should be reviewed if growth remained strong.   For now, the accommodative stance in monetary policy needs to be maintained,  Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said in a speech celebrating the bank's 67th anniversary.  Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol speaks during a news conference at Seoul Foreign Correspondent's Club January 22, 2015.Kim Hong-Ji Having said that, if economic recovery continues and shows clear signs of improvement, we may need to adjust the pace of monetary policy easing so we will need to thoroughly review such cases.  Lee said he saw upside risks to the bank's economic growth estimate of 2.6 percent for this year, thanks to improving exports and the supplementary budget proposed.  But for now, uncertainty remained high and inflationary pressure was not strong, which meant the bank should maintain its current record-low interest rate of 1.25 percent for the time being, he said. South Korea's economy grew 1.1 percent in January to March on a seasonally adjusted basis, its strongest in six quarters. Most analysts believe the central bank will keep borrowing costs unchanged for the rest of this year, before it considers starting to normalize rates next year.

The Predators entered the playoffs as the lowest seed in the Western Conference with 94 points and had a daunting road to the NHL's championship round, one that few fans in Music City could realistically have expected they would reach. But at some point while they eliminated top-seeded Chicago, division-winning Anaheim and a 99-point St. Louis team, they developed a swagger about them and suddenly went from a group hoping to win a Stanley Cup to one expecting to win. Even after dropping the first two games of the best-of-seven Final to a Penguins team featuring some of the NHL's most lethal scorers, Nashville stormed back to even the series but ran out of gas and were held scoreless the next two games.  It stings,  said Predators defenseman P.K. Subban.  A lot of emotions, a lot of tears and there should be. Everybody cares and we obviously wanted to lift the Cup this year but it didn't happen.  On their journey, the Predators captivated a city known more for honky tonk than hockey and one that had never before seen their team get beyond the midway point of the postseason. So smitten were fans that a section of the city's famous Broadway was closed for public viewing parties that saw the street jammed with fans clad in the team's gold and blue colors. The Predators proved a resilient bunch that found different ways to get wins, sometimes relying on their stellar goaltending to steal a game, other times it was a stingy defense or simply opportunistic scoring. But on Sunday, facing elimination for the first time in their surprising postseason run, the Predators simply could not find a way to solve the Penguins. In cruel fashion, the Predators' heartbreak was compounded by a referee's blown call that erased a potential game-changing goal in a tight, scoreless game early in the second period.  We hate the result, but our guys gave a pretty good effort, and it's difficult for us right now because our sights were set on winning the championship,  said Predators head coach Peter Laviolette.  It's difficult to think that we're not playing tomorrow.  The Predators made their NHL debut in the Music City in 1998 and had never been beyond the second round in nine previous playoff appearances. They may not play in the most traditional of hockey markets but the latest playoff run suddenly has the fanbase, some who occasionally throw catfish onto the ice during games, expecting a winner rather than being content just to have a team.  You never know when you're going to get another opportunity,  said Predators goalie Pekka Rinne.  The only thing I was thinking about was that Cup and dreaming about that and playing for that. It's tough to accept and tough to handle, but I'm really proud of this team.

In its biggest one-day slide since December, the MSCI Asia Pacific Information Technology index fell 1.5 percent, after hitting a 17-year high on Friday. That pulled down the MSCI Asia Pacific index by 0.4 percent. But with Asian tech valuations cheap relative to U.S. ones, investors and analysts in the region largely dismiss the possibility that Monday's pullback will turn into a longer-term rout. Chinese internet firm JD.com, Chinese mobile social networking company Momo Inc., Korean internet service firm Naver Corp. and tech equipment maker LG Innotek slumped between 5.5 and 6.5 percent. For a graphic on Asian tech share trends, click reut.rs/2rQV3il U.S. tech stocks fell sharply on Friday as concerns about Apple's new iPhones and a cautious Goldman Sachs report on the sector prompted investors to book profits and rotate into less expensive counters. The S&P; 500 information technology index shed 2.7 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped as much as 2.9 percent before closing down 1.8 percent. Apple Inc., Alphabet, and Amazon three of the five biggest companies on the Nasdaq, closed down more than 3 percent each, with Apple suffering its biggest one-day loss in 14 months.  The mini-tech crash last week appeared to be rotation into laggards, e.g. financials, and therefore one should not necessarily believe this is the beginning of a long rout,  said Sat Duhra, an Asian fund manager at Henderson Global Investors.  However that's not to say it's undeserved â too many tech stocks have re-rated without producing the goods â they are driven by sentiment rather than exceptional earning beats and this kind of move... is not sustainable.  A Bloomberg News report that iPhones to be launched later this year will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones knocked Apple's shares, which had surged over 50 percent over the past year on high hopes for the iPhone8. In Asia, Apple suppliers Hon Hai Precision Industry and LG Display dropped as much as 2.9 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, on Monday. Sinking in Their Fangs  The tech sector cannot lead markets forever and with many of these tech stocks at or near 52-week highs, we see this as a bit of profit taking for now, but will closely monitor the situation this week,  said Chris Brankin, chief executive officer at TD Ameritrade Asia in Singapore. The five largest technology leaders -- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google-parent Alphabet -- shed a staggering $100 billion on Friday alone to dampen the stellar performance of the sector for all of 2017, Brankin noted. But investors and analysts remained largely sanguine about the fundamentals of Asian tech companies, despite Monday's pullback. Jim McCafferty, head of Asia ex-Japan equity research at Nomura in Hong Kong, attributed much of the declines in Asia to the contagion effect.  When a big company like Apple drops 4 percent, there's going to be a knock-on effect,  McCafferty said.  For Asia, the hard data suggests that the sector continues to grow. And valuations don't appear that stretched relative to the U.S.  The MSCI Asia Pacific IT benchmark is trading at 14.9 times forward earnings, while the MSCI U.S. IT index is at 18.6, according to Thomson Reuters DataStream. While some Asian companies have surged on the back of factors other than fundamentals -- such as Tencent, which has been lifted by mainland Chinese demand for Hong Kong stocks -- strong performers can be found, Henderson's Duhra said.  One should stick to tech names backed up by strong operational performance and strong earnings support,  he said.  For example, JD.com, in our view, is more attractive on that basis today versus Alibaba.  Samsung Electronics, which, despite a 66 percent gain in the past year is trading at only 13 times earnings, is also a good buy, Duhra said. Samsung fell 1.7 percent on Monday.  Stocks do not go up in a straight line,  Nomura's McCafferty said.  We feel quite relaxed.

Victoria state police said in a statement on their website that the man faced four charges, including possessing a firearm unlawfully and committing an offense while on bail. He was set to appear in court on June 14. The deadly siege took place on June 6 in Australia's second-largest city, with police shooting dead gunman Yacqub Khayre after he killed a man in the foyer of an apartment block and held a woman hostage inside. Turnbull said police were treating the siege as an  act of terrorism  after a claim by the Islamic State group that one of its fighters was the gunman responsible. Australia, a staunch ally of the United States and its action against the Islamic State militant group in Syria and Iraq, is on high alert for attacks by sympathizers of the radical group and from home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East. The 2014 Lindt cafe siege in Sydney, in which the hostage-taker and two people were killed, was Australia's most deadly violence inspired by Islamic State militants. Several people were held hostage for more than 17 hours in the cafe by a gunman who was on bail after being charged with sexual assault and being an accessory to murder. In inquiry into the Lindt siege last month found that police failed to respond quickly enough and last week New South Wales state premier announced that police would be allowed to shoot suspects in  terrorist related  incidents even if the attacker does not pose an imminent threat. Australia has also signaled a drive to reform parole laws as a result of the Melbourne siege, including a ban on parole for violent offenders who have any links to extremism, as Khayre was on parole for a violent break-and-enter offense.

Obviously, it's unfortunate, but what are you going to do? It just (stinks) that we're on the losing side of it,  Nashville defenseman P.K. Subban said. Later in the period, Sissons was stopped on a breakaway. D Ryan Ellis, who sustained an undisclosed injury in the second period of Game 5, was back in uniform and in the starting lineup for Game 6.

Crosby, who was widely considered the heir to Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky, silenced any remaining critics by helping his Pittsburgh Penguins become the first team in almost 20 years to repeat as NHL champions and picked up a second consecutive Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP as well.  He's now one of the best to ever play the game,  Penguins owner Mario Lemieux, a two-time Stanley Cup winner as a player, said of his former team mate.  To win three Stanley Cups and two Conn Smythe (trophies) in a row is pretty good.  Crosby was the Penguins' second-highest scorer in the playoffs with 27 points and the 29-year-old saved his best performance for Game Five of the Final with the series tied 2-2 and Nashville riding the momentum of consecutive victories.  With the destiny of the Stanley Cup in the balance, a determined Crosby delivered a dominating performance right from the opening shift, when he rang a shot off the post while being pulled down to the ice by a Predators defenseman. Crosby went on to record three assists on the team's first five goals in a 6-0 romp to become Pittsburgh's all-time leading scorer in Stanley Cup Finals.

Mandatory Credit: Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY Sports He made a statement in that game,  Lemieux, a Hall of Famer who is the eighth-leading scorer in NHL history, said after winning his third title as an owner.  He could feel that we were getting close to winning the Cup and that was the most important game of the season and he played like it. He was unbelievable.  In addition to Crosby's NHL accomplishments over the last year, he also led Canada to a World Cup of Hockey gold medal and was named MVP in that tournament. His career, which has earned him numerous individual awards, also includes two Olympic gold medals, most notably the 2010 triumph in which he scored the winning goal in overtime. But Crosby remains too humble to enter the debate of where his latest accomplishments put him in the conversation of all-time greats.  I don't think (it means) a whole lot. To share this with this group of guys, that was our goal at the start of the year,  said Crosby, who is the third player to win the Conn Smythe Trophy in consecutive years.  We knew (repeating as champions) hadn't been done in a long time and to be able to accomplish it is a great feeling.

With the Fed widely expected to raise interest rates at its two-day meeting that ends on Wednesday, investors will be focussing on whether the central bank thinks the U.S. economy is robust enough to withstand further rate hikes through 2017 and how it plans to whittle down its massive balance sheet.       A 25 basis point rate hike is assumed to be a done deal for the June FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee); with interest rate markets ascribing over 90 percent probability,  Mizuho Bank said in a note.      This means a 25 basis point hike is baked into market (prices), and so failure to yank the trigger will result in a dovish knee-jerk reaction; but this is the outside risk.      MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , however, was down 0.8 percent as the region's technology heavyweights were knocked lower by a slide in U.S. tech shares.     Singapore shares rose as much as 0.5 percent to a four-week high, driven by financials, before paring some of the gains.     In other markets, Indonesia was up 0.5 percent with consumer stocks driving the gains. Investors are awaiting Bank Indonesia's policy rate decision expected later this week.      (We) expect Bank Indonesia to keep its policy rate steady this week. While Q1 GDP growth came in slightly disappointing, there are enough data to suggest stronger growth momentum in H2,  DBS Group said in a note.     Vietnam shares rose 0.5 percent, led by FLC Faros Construction, which jumped as much as 6.9 percent to post its biggest intra-day percentage gain in more than three months.

Spreadbetters expected European shares to follow suit, forecasting lower openings for Britain's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's CAC. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.8 percent, with the tech index sliding 1.5 percent. Technology stocks sold off sharply on Wall Street on Friday on concerns about Apple's new iPhones and a cautious Goldman Sachs report about the stocks, prompting heavy profit taking after an extended rally. Asia's tech giants followed suit on Monday, with South Korea's Samsung Electronics losing 1.8 percent, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co down 1.6 percent and Japan's Sharp Corp shedding 2.7 percent. Japan's Nikkei was down 0.6 percent and South Korea's KOSPI slid 1.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.3 percent while Shanghai fell 0.5 percent. Electronics shipments have helped lead an export revival for many of Asia's trade-reliant economies.  The drop on Nasdaq appears to be taking a toll today. But the tech sector was strong and perhaps ready for profit taking, with the Fed meeting also approaching,  said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.  One day of losses on Wall Street does not change the broader picture but it has managed to dampen sentiment.  The Fed will begin a two-day meeting ending on Wednesday at which it is widely expected to hike interest rates. The focus is on whether the Fed thinks the U.S. economy is robust enough to withstand further rate increases through 2017 and how it plans to whittle down its massive balance sheet. A rate hike accompanied by a message suggesting that the Fed may raise rates more than expected in 2017 would support the dollar but be negative for equity markets.  Political events like the UK election and Comey's testimony are over and the focus this week shifts to monetary policy,  said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  The equity markets and the dollar have mostly priced in the Fed signalling three rate hikes in 2017. That explains why U.S. equities have held up. But if the Fed hints at more than three hikes, that could trigger a sell-off in equities that many are bracing for.  Equities navigated through last week's potential landmine events relatively unscathed. Congressional testimony by former FBI Director James Comey caused few market ructions, and the fallout of Britain's surprise parliamentary election result, at which the ruling party lost the majority, was mostly contained to the pound. Sterling was a shade higher at $1.2755 on Monday after sliding 1.7 percent on Friday, when it plumbed a near two-month low of $1.2636. The pound appeared to be taking a breather as British Prime Minister Theresa May scrambled to reunite her Conservative Party, attempting to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish party that would enable her to stay in power. Talks on Britain's exit from the European Union are due to start next Monday. The dollar was steady at 110.300 yen. The euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.1206 following three straight days of losses against the greenback. The dollar index against a basket of currencies was little changed at 97.200 following its rise on Friday to a 9-day high of 97.500. The U.S. currency received support as Treasury yields, at seven-month lows early last week at the height of investor jitters towards the UK elections and Comey's testimony, continued their bounce ahead of the Fed's anticipated rate hike. In commodities, crude oil prices extended gains after rising on Friday when a pipeline leak in major producer Nigeria overshadowed supply worries weighing on the market. U.S. crude and Brent were both 0.6 percent higher at $46.10 and $48.45 a barrel, respectively.

The Chinese-made Y-8-200F transport plane crashed into the sea last Wednesday when it was carrying 122 soldiers, family members and crew on a weekly flight from several coastal towns to Myanmar's largest city, Yangon. The number of bodies retrieved so far rose to 62 on Monday as the hunt for the plane stretched into a sixth day, the military said on its official Facebook page. Nine children were among those found. While the cause of the incident has yet to be confirmed, Myanmar's Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing said on Sunday there was  a very big cloud  near the plane crash site, according to his official Facebook page. He did not elaborate.  The crashed plane was expected to be found soon as it crashed in the country's territory and some evidences were collected,  he said. Myanmar authorities had rejected offers of help from several countries including China, the state-run newspaper Global New Light of Myanmar said on Sunday. Some bodies pulled from the waters off Myanmar's southern coast were cremated last week as relatives and friends mourned the identified victims in the coastal town of Dawei. Aircraft accidents, involving both civilian and military planes, are not uncommon in the Southeast Asian country. A military helicopter crashed last June, killing three military personnel. Five were killed in February last year when an air force aircraft crashed in the capital, Naypyitaw, media reports said.

With droughts, it's different. If the rains don't come, it can take months for the effects to be felt by poor rural families. Hunger kicks in only after crops fail, food stocks are exhausted and livestock start dying - but by then, help often comes too late to head off the worst.   The humanitarian world is still struggling to find a timely way to tackle  slow-onset  crises like droughts.  But a UK-based coalition of 42 relief groups from five continents, aiming to make aid delivery more effective, thinks it might have an answer. The Start Network, funded by the British, Dutch and Irish governments, is putting together a new financing facility to enable a faster and more coordinated response to droughts, and plans to test its model in Pakistan and Zimbabwe. In May, the network convened local and international agencies in Harare to discuss how it might work in the southern African nation still smarting from a devastating 2015-2016 drought, driven by the El Nino climate pattern, which left some 4 million people in need of food aid.  A 2016 U.N.-led appeal for more than $350 million to respond to the drought was less than 50 percent covered by donors.   We realized humanitarian responses were not kicking in fast,  said Emily Montier, manager of the drought project for the Start Network.  There was a long period of procrastination with some decisions having to be made far away, resulting in delays.  The  drought financing facility  aims to combine contingency funds, insurance and new modeling technology to shift humanitarian response from reaction to anticipation, she added.   This will save more lives, livelihoods and assets, and significantly reduce costs,  she said. Montier said many aid groups responding to drought had tried to access the Start Network's existing fund for swift relief in small-scale crises, but it backs 45-day projects which is too short for drawn-out situations like droughts.   Droughts were coming to that mechanism purely because there was nothing else out there,  Montier told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Local Needs Other efforts to provide cash in time to stop droughts turning into hunger crises are gathering steam, including the African Risk Capacity, which provides payouts to African governments that take out cover, and index-based insurance for farmers, now growing in popularity from Kenya to India. The Start Network facility aims to be more flexible while still operating on a national level, releasing its own funds for aid organizations to respond to smaller crises and tapping insurance payouts for large emergencies. How it functions will differ according to the country. In Zimbabwe, a lot is already happening to help communities weather drought but that needs to be stepped up when conditions worsen, whereas in Pakistan, chronic dryness in some areas has created humanitarian needs that are simply going unmet, said Montier. Shahida Arif, Asia regional learning adviser for the Start Network, said water shortages in Pakistani provinces like Sindh cause long-term nutritional problems and food insecurity.  With little help at hand, poor families are forced to sell off their cattle and other meager assets to survive.   The government agencies do not have any plan so far to respond to drought,  said Arif.  That could change after Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) announced in February it would join the Start partnership to test the new facility in places like Sindh where tens of thousands of people were suffering the effects of drought.     With work near completion on web-based scientific models to calculate drought risks and potential funding options, the Start Network is talking to donor governments about funding the next stage of implementing the facility in Pakistan and Zimbabwe. Josh Ling of Mercy Corps in Pakistan said the project had  huge potential  to improve the lives of drought-hit communities, as it is designed to allow agencies to act rapidly and on a far bigger scale than individual insurance policies. In Zimbabwe, some of the agencies involved - which include CARE International, Christian Aid and ActionAid - suggested the facility could be expanded to cover drought impacts on livestock as well as crops, and should also be used for floods. If successful, the model may be applied to other natural hazards, Montier said.  There is a real need to gather more evidence around these approaches and how they work in practice,  she added.

The Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) polled chief investment officers and reserve managers at 31 public sector institutions with combined assets under management of $4.21 trillion. With low or even negative returns from fixed income, and volatility in equity markets, there is growing appetite for illiquid assets that deliver steady, predictable returns. Some 24 percent of respondents plan to increase their real estate holdings in the next 12 months, and 37 percent want to boost infrastructure, the survey showed. Private equity also remains in favor, with 23 percent wanting to raise allocations.  Meanwhile 26 percent plan to cut their developed market government bond allocation, while higher yielding corporate credit and emerging market bonds are growing in popularity.  Some 15.4 percent of the survey respondents cited low returns as one of their biggest concerns, just behind geopolitical risk, cited by 16.2 percent of respondents. Worries over a new crisis in the European Union and Brexit, and concerns about Donald Trump's presidency and a backlash against trade liberalization also featured prominently. The survey noted a growing interest in the green economy, with 38 percent planning to buy more green bonds, and 35 percent wanting to boost their exposure to renewables.  The most enthusiastic investors in these assets are central banks and pension funds from North America and Europe,  OMFIF said, adding this was one way for investors to achieve adequate returns while meeting low carbon requirements. The survey was published as part of OMFIF's annual report and ranking, which covers 750 public investors such as central banks, sovereign funds and public pension funds.  Total assets under management rose to $33.5 trillion at end-2016, up 1.4 percent from 2015, helped by the improving global economy. Pressures facing commodity exporters also abated after oil prices rose off January 2016 lows.  Asset growth was driven by pension funds, up $435 billion, and sovereign funds, up $143 billion. Central bank assets declined by $103 billion. The People's Bank of China remained the world's biggest asset holder, despite a year-on-year decline of 9 percent, or $307 billion, to $3.097 trillion. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority was dislodged from the top 10, falling to 11th place after using $76.3 billion in foreign reserves in 2016, leaving it with $539 billion.  It was replaced in the top 10 by the Federal Employees Retirement System of the United States, which has almost $558 million. The Swiss National Bank, ranked seventh, managed a $76 billion rise in assets, caused by intervention to hold down the Swiss franc and strong equity returns. Conversely, the Revenue Regulation Fund of Algeria suffered the largest fall of any sovereign fund, drawing down $42.4 billion, or 85 percent of assets, to fill large holes in the national budget.  OMFIF said the fall in the price of oil and gas, which make up around 95 percent of the country's export receipts, had resulted in a 90 percent fall in assets since end-2014.     Total official gold holdings rose by 377 tonnes to an estimated 31,500 tonnes at end-2016, the highest level since 1999, OMFIF said.  The central banks of Russia, China and Kazakhstan led the buying, whilst Turkey, Venezuela and Azerbaijan saw the biggest declines. Germany remains the second largest holder of gold after the United States. Editing by Toby Chopra","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-cenbank-assets-idUSKBN1930CU"},

Meanwhile 26 percent plan to cut their developed market government bond allocation, while higher yielding corporate credit and emerging market bonds are growing in popularity.  Some 15.4 percent of the survey respondents cited low returns as one of their biggest concerns, just behind geopolitical risk, cited by 16.2 percent of respondents. Worries over a new crisis in the European Union and Brexit, and concerns about Donald Trump's presidency and a backlash against trade liberalization also featured prominently. The survey noted a growing interest in the green economy, with 38 percent planning to buy more green bonds, and 35 percent wanting to boost their exposure to renewables.  The most enthusiastic investors in these assets are central banks and pension funds from North America and Europe,  OMFIF said, adding this was one way for investors to achieve adequate returns while meeting low carbon requirements. The survey was published as part of OMFIF's annual report and ranking, which covers 750 public investors such as central banks, sovereign funds and public pension funds.  Total assets under management rose to $33.5 trillion at end-2016, up 1.4 percent from 2015, helped by the improving global economy. Pressures facing commodity exporters also abated after oil prices rose off January 2016 lows.  Asset growth was driven by pension funds, up $435 billion, and sovereign funds, up $143 billion. Central bank assets declined by $103 billion. The People's Bank of China remained the world's biggest asset holder, despite a year-on-year decline of 9 percent, or $307 billion, to $3.097 trillion. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority was dislodged from the top 10, falling to 11th place after using $76.3 billion in foreign reserves in 2016, leaving it with $539 billion.  It was replaced in the top 10 by the Federal Employees Retirement System of the United States, which has almost $558 million. The Swiss National Bank, ranked seventh, managed a $76 billion rise in assets, caused by intervention to hold down the Swiss franc and strong equity returns. Conversely, the Revenue Regulation Fund of Algeria suffered the largest fall of any sovereign fund, drawing down $42.4 billion, or 85 percent of assets, to fill large holes in the national budget.  OMFIF said the fall in the price of oil and gas, which make up around 95 percent of the country's export receipts, had resulted in a 90 percent fall in assets since end-2014.     Total official gold holdings rose by 377 tonnes to an estimated 31,500 tonnes at end-2016, the highest level since 1999, OMFIF said.  The central banks of Russia, China and Kazakhstan led the buying, whilst Turkey, Venezuela and Azerbaijan saw the biggest declines. Germany remains the second largest holder of gold after the United States. Editing by Toby Chopra","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-cenbank-assets-idUSL8N1J5521"},

With droughts, it's different. If the rains don't come, it can take months for the effects to be felt by poor rural families. Hunger kicks in only after crops fail, food stocks are exhausted and livestock start dying - but by then, help often comes too late to head off the worst.   The humanitarian world is still struggling to find a timely way to tackle  slow-onset  crises like droughts.  But a UK-based coalition of 42 relief groups from five continents, aiming to make aid delivery more effective, thinks it might have an answer. The Start Network, funded by the British, Dutch and Irish governments, is putting together a new financing facility to enable a faster and more coordinated response to droughts, and plans to test its model in Pakistan and Zimbabwe. In May, the network convened local and international agencies in Harare to discuss how it might work in the southern African nation still smarting from a devastating 2015-2016 drought, driven by the El Nino climate pattern, which left some 4 million people in need of food aid.  A 2016 U.N.-led appeal for more than $350 million to respond to the drought was less than 50 percent covered by donors.   We realized humanitarian responses were not kicking in fast,  said Emily Montier, manager of the drought project for the Start Network.  There was a long period of procrastination with some decisions having to be made far away, resulting in delays.  The  drought financing facility  aims to combine contingency funds, insurance and new modeling technology to shift humanitarian response from reaction to anticipation, she added.   This will save more lives, livelihoods and assets, and significantly reduce costs,  she said. Montier said many aid groups responding to drought had tried to access the Start Network's existing fund for swift relief in small-scale crises, but it backs 45-day projects which is too short for drawn-out situations like droughts.   Droughts were coming to that mechanism purely because there was nothing else out there,  Montier told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Local Needs Other efforts to provide cash in time to stop droughts turning into hunger crises are gathering steam, including the African Risk Capacity, which provides payouts to African governments that take out cover, and index-based insurance for farmers, now growing in popularity from Kenya to India. The Start Network facility aims to be more flexible while still operating on a national level, releasing its own funds for aid organizations to respond to smaller crises and tapping insurance payouts for large emergencies. How it functions will differ according to the country. In Zimbabwe, a lot is already happening to help communities weather drought but that needs to be stepped up when conditions worsen, whereas in Pakistan, chronic dryness in some areas has created humanitarian needs that are simply going unmet, said Montier. Shahida Arif, Asia regional learning adviser for the Start Network, said water shortages in Pakistani provinces like Sindh cause long-term nutritional problems and food insecurity.  With little help at hand, poor families are forced to sell off their cattle and other meager assets to survive.   The government agencies do not have any plan so far to respond to drought,  said Arif.  That could change after Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) announced in February it would join the Start partnership to test the new facility in places like Sindh where tens of thousands of people were suffering the effects of drought.     With work near completion on web-based scientific models to calculate drought risks and potential funding options, the Start Network is talking to donor governments about funding the next stage of implementing the facility in Pakistan and Zimbabwe. Josh Ling of Mercy Corps in Pakistan said the project had  huge potential  to improve the lives of drought-hit communities, as it is designed to allow agencies to act rapidly and on a far bigger scale than individual insurance policies. In Zimbabwe, some of the agencies involved - which include CARE International, Christian Aid and ActionAid - suggested the facility could be expanded to cover drought impacts on livestock as well as crops, and should also be used for floods. If successful, the model may be applied to other natural hazards, Montier said.  There is a real need to gather more evidence around these approaches and how they work in practice,  she added.

The U.S. Commerce Department's regulations  hit list  recommendations follow more than three months of study and consultation with industry on ways to streamline regulations and ease burdens on manufacturing firms.  A Trump administration official with knowledge of the recommendations to be sent to the White House said the Environmental Protection Agency's complex permitting rules will be a key focus, echoing comments to Reuters by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month. The 171 public comments submitted by companies and industry groups offer a strong hint to priorities for Commerce's streamlining efforts, with numerous industry groups and firms complaining that EPA air quality permit rules for new facilities are often redundant. The report will analyze the submissions and  will identify a lot of problems and lay out ways to take responsible actions,  said the official, who declined to be identified by name. The process has looked at many regulations finalized under Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama. A common demand from industry was that the Trump administration should reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards, with several groups arguing this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for new facilities, raising costs. 3M Co (MMM.N) said other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act contained  overlapping rules, redundant requirements, conflicts between rules and undue complexity.  The National Association of Manufacturers said the EPA's review requirements for new sources of emissions such as factories can add $100,000 in costs for modeling air quality to a new facility and delay factory expansions by 18 months. It added that EPA should find ways to ease burdens for smaller projects and smaller firms. Also drawing complaints from construction groups and iron foundries is an incoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule reducing by 80 percent the amount of crystalline silica dust that can be inhaled. The dust, common on construction sites, can cause lung cancer, according to OSHA, but industry groups say reducing it to those levels will be prohibitively expensive.  To meet these much lower levels, new engineering controls and other measures will become necessary within the roofing industry,  said the National Roofing Contractors Association. Trump has already taken steps to roll back some not fully completed Obama-era environmental regulations such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants and a clean water rule greatly restricting runoff into small streams. But the Commerce list may target some rules already on the books.     We are at the outset of what we think will be a very intense deregulatory agenda from the Trump team,  said Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group.  We are concerned that they are looking to gut regulations that benefit workers and benefit consumers.  Another OSHA rule that drew industry complaints is one that further reduces worker exposure to beryllium, another potential carcinogen, that became effective on May 20 after a decade-long rulemaking effort. Manufacturing groups including auto parts makers have also targeted labor rules that make it easier for unions to organize workers, expand the number of employees eligible for overtime and govern the reporting of workplace injuries. The range of industry complaints is vast. Mining giant Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N) argued that planned EPA financial responsibility requirements for hard rock mining operations costing billions of dollars were based on inadequate study and  will have disastrous consequences for the mining industry.  Guitar maker Taylor Guitars said that permits needed from the Fish and Wildlife Service for mother-of-pearl used to decorate instruments was unnecessarily raising its costs.  This declaration requirement does not seem to serve any conservation or other purpose. The shell is not a species that is protected under law,  the company said.

Einhorn,Mitch Golden,Nathaniel August,Steve Algert,Thomas Hill,US,HEDGEFUNDS,GREENLIGHTMASTERS,Wealth Management,Hedge Funds,Funds,Major News,Graphics,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Corporate Events,Investment Management and Fund Operators (TRBC),United States","sector":"Subjects","content":" BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York's Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can't get from sitting in an office.   This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,  the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.  His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.Â     Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm' Â    Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research's HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index's 3.3 percent return over the same period.  It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden's clients.  Golden is known for the time he takes â sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.  He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.   Mitch hustles hard to know who's out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn't ready to invest immediately,  said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters' portfolio for a decade.  To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.   We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,  Golden said.  It is a very subtle balance.   Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis.  For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.   The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a  Kabuki dance  in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.  Mitch Golden, portfolio manager for hedge fund Greenlight Masters, speaks during an interview at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. Photo taken May 8, 2017.Brendan McDermidSometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.  Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam's biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.  Playground Chats  On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central ParkÂ talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.  Slideshow (2 Images)Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.  In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhornâs Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.  He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill's $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August's $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden's top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.  Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates' early dramatic gains.   That can be very costly,  he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.  Greenlight Masters is Einhorn's brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.  Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.  After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a  D-meet  with Einhorn at Greenlight's midtown Manhattan offices.   It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,  he said.

China's blue-chip CSI300 index fared better than small caps, slipping just 0.1 percent to 3,573.39 points by the lunch break. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent, to 3,144.30 points. In Hong Kong, both the Hang Seng index and the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost more than 1 percent, to 25,712.55 points and 10,480.33 points, respectively. Both China and Hong Kong-listed tech shares dropped sharply, following a sell-off on Friday in technology stocks on Wall Street that was triggered by concerns about Apple's new iPhones and a cautious Goldman Sachs report about the sector. China's tech-heavy growth board ChiNext lost nearly 1 percent, while the CSI TMT Index fell 1.1 percent, both underperforming the broader market. Selling was more intensive in Hong Kong, where stocks are more vulnerable to Wall Street fluctuations. An index tracking IT shares tumbled 2.6 percent, led by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Elsewhere, investors dumped cyclical stocks amid rising concern that China's economy would suffer from an expected credit tightening in the second half. UBS strategist Gao Ting said that although Chinese investors  are likely mentally prepared for short-term liquidity pressure due to financial regulations, we don't believe they pay enough attention to future economic trends.  Gao also said he expected that general credit may tighten, hitting property and other investment activity, and that factory gate prices  may decline rapidly.  Echoing the view, Haitong Securities analyst Jiang Chao said that  credit tightening presents the biggest risk in the second half,  as impacts from Beijing's deleveraging campaign will be transmitted to the real economy. Also souring sentiment in China, major state-controlled newspapers on Monday urged the stock market regulator not to  balk or backtrack  on reforms, denting hopes that IPOs could be suspended if the market remains weak.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has slowed approvals for initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent weeks, a period which has seen major stock indexes retreat. The media's calls come at a time that international investors are watching Beijing's commitment to free-market reforms more closely than ever. Global index provider MSCI will decide on June 20 whether to add Chinese shares to its key equity benchmarks used by asset managers, which could trigger a flood of foreign buying. China's on-again, off-again pattern of IPO approvals has been typical for years when authorities see the need to shore up markets, and their penchant for interventions has been cited as one of the key concerns holding back global investors. Such support measures are often welcomed at home, but in a rare chorus of caution, China's three major state-controlled securities newspapers all published editorials on Monday urging the regulator to  hang on  in the face of public criticism that a flood of new supply is depressing share prices.    Over the past few weeks, the CSRC has approved an average of 2.1 billion yuan ($309 million) of IPOs each week, down from a weekly average of over 5 billion yuan earlier in the year. That has led to speculation that IPOs would be suspended altogether if the market falls much farther.       If IPOs are suspended, it is far from certain whether the market can be rescued, but the harm to market-oriented reforms and the real economy is predictable,  the China Securities Journal said in an editorial on Monday, calling on regulators to be  adamant  toward reforms. Echoing that view, the Shanghai Securities News said IPOs are not the determinant factor of stock market trends, and regulators should not  balk, or even backtrack  on reforms.  The newspaper noted that the CSRC had suspended IPOs nine times in history, but each time the move failed to reverse the bearish trend and heightened investor uncertainty. Another official newspaper, the Securities Times, said regulators should not bow to pressure from critics.  Regulators should  dare to touch the cheese of interested groups, and be consistent, and serious in policies,  the editorial said.  Generally speaking, China's securities market regulation is not too harsh, but too lenient.  The editorials highlight the dilemma faced by CSRC Chairman Liu Shiyu, who needs to balance reforms and market stability.  Liu, who took over as head of the CSRC in the aftermath of the 2015 market crash, has been criticized by some academics and investors for causing renewed market sluggishness, by flooding the market with IPOs and cracking down on stock speculation. However, the Financial News, a journal run by the People's Bank of China, carried a different tone on the IPO issue in a commentary which also ran on Monday. Fewer IPO approvals won't necessarily affect the stock market's performance but show a change in the regulator's stance, which will improve investor sentiment and stabilize the stock market, the commentary said. After a solid start to the year, China's benchmark CSI300 index .CSI300 started skidding in April on worries that the economy was losing steam and in response to a regulatory clampdown on riskier types of lending which has prompted some companies to hoard cash. In recent weeks, authorities have stepped in with a slew of measures to stabilise the country's financial markets ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle later this year. The central bank has been stepping up injections of funds into the financial system to ease fears of a potential cash crunch like that which sent lending rates soaring in June 2013. It has also engineered a sharp rise in the yuan currency against the dollar to ward off speculators betting on further declines.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has slowed approvals for initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent weeks, a period which has seen major stock indexes retreat. The media's calls come at a time that international investors are watching Beijing's commitment to free-market reforms more closely than ever. Global index provider MSCI will decide on June 20 whether to add Chinese shares to its key equity benchmarks used by asset managers, which could trigger a flood of foreign buying. China's on-again, off-again pattern of IPO approvals has been typical for years when authorities see the need to shore up markets, and their penchant for interventions has been cited as one of the key concerns holding back global investors. Such support measures are often welcomed at home, but in a rare chorus of caution, China's three major state-controlled securities newspapers all published editorials on Monday urging the regulator to  hang on  in the face of public criticism that a flood of new supply is depressing share prices.    Over the past few weeks, the CSRC has approved an average of 2.1 billion yuan ($309 million) of IPOs each week, down from a weekly average of over 5 billion yuan earlier in the year. That has led to speculation that IPOs would be suspended altogether if the market falls much farther.       If IPOs are suspended, it is far from certain whether the market can be rescued, but the harm to market-oriented reforms and the real economy is predictable,  the China Securities Journal said in an editorial on Monday, calling on regulators to be  adamant  toward reforms. Echoing that view, the Shanghai Securities News said IPOs are not the determinant factor of stock market trends, and regulators should not  balk, or even backtrack  on reforms.  The newspaper noted that the CSRC had suspended IPOs nine times in history, but each time the move failed to reverse the bearish trend and heightened investor uncertainty. Another official newspaper, the Securities Times, said regulators should not bow to pressure from critics.  Regulators should  dare to touch the cheese of interested groups, and be consistent, and serious in policies,  the editorial said.  Generally speaking, China's securities market regulation is not too harsh, but too lenient.  The editorials highlight the dilemma faced by CSRC Chairman Liu Shiyu, who needs to balance reforms and market stability.  Liu, who took over as head of the CSRC in the aftermath of the 2015 market crash, has been criticized by some academics and investors for causing renewed market sluggishness, by flooding the market with IPOs and cracking down on stock speculation. However, the Financial News, a journal run by the People's Bank of China, carried a different tone on the IPO issue in a commentary which also ran on Monday. Fewer IPO approvals won't necessarily affect the stock market's performance but show a change in the regulator's stance, which will improve investor sentiment and stabilize the stock market, the commentary said. After a solid start to the year, China's benchmark CSI300 index .CSI300 started skidding in April on worries that the economy was losing steam and in response to a regulatory clampdown on riskier types of lending which has prompted some companies to hoard cash. In recent weeks, authorities have stepped in with a slew of measures to stabilise the country's financial markets ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle later this year. The central bank has been stepping up injections of funds into the financial system to ease fears of a potential cash crunch like that which sent lending rates soaring in June 2013. It has also engineered a sharp rise in the yuan currency against the dollar to ward off speculators betting on further declines.

Rewinding the clock to the days when he was untouchable on the crushed brick dust, the 31-year-old turned 2015 champion Wawrinka into a human punch bag, winning in just over two hours. This title, a record 10th at a single grand slam in the professional era, was arguably the most impressive of his 15 majors, though, as it arrived three injury-plagued years after the last one when he beat Novak Djokovic here in 2014. He also did it without dropping a set and conceding only 35 games in seven matches. Only Bjorn Borg, who conceded 32 on his way to the 1978 title, has been a more ruthless champion. Third seed Wawrinka, having beaten world number one Andy Murray with a majestic display of firepower in a grueling semi-final, arrived full of hope as, at 32, he tried to become the oldest French Open winner since Andres Gimeno in 1972. But the barrel-chested 'Stanimal' was powerless as Nadal turned the final into an exhibition of his claycourt supremacy -- taking his French Open record to an eye-watering 79-2. As a weary Wawrinka sliced a volley into the net on match point Nadal collapsed on his back on the baseline. Emotional Nadal Related CoverageWawrinka adds Annacone to coaching team for grasscourt seasonFrench Open king Nadal hails Uncle Toni after tenth French Open titleFactbox: French Open champion Rafael Nadal I'm a little emotional,  Nadal said before his tearful uncle Toni, his career-long coach who will take a back seat at the end of the year, handed him LaÂ Coupe des Mousquetaires.  The nerves and adrenaline I feel on this court is impossible to compare.  Wawrinka said he had not found his best level but paid tribute to the man he beat to win the first of his three grand slam titles in Australia in 2014.  For sure he's playing the best he's ever played. That's for sure. Not only here,  Wawrinka said.  It's a tough loss. But I played against the biggest clay-court player ever.  Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 11, 2017   Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates with the trophy after winning the final against Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka   Reuters / Gonzalo FuentesStraw hats and fans were de rigueur for an expectant Court Philippe Chatrier as the final began with temperatures hovering around the 30 degrees Celcius mark -- optimum conditions for Nadal's monstrous topspin game. Wawrinka, who spent nearly five hours more on court than Nadal to reach the final, looked confused and heavy-legged although he did have a glimmer in the third game when Nadal, still settling down, saved a break point. First Blood  Nadal failed to convert any of the four break points he had in the following game, but drew first blood the next time an opportunity arose to take a 4-2 lead. Slideshow (8 Images)Then he switched on the afterburners, taking Wawrinka out of the equation, and minutes later the Swiss wafted a forehand long to hand Nadal a second break of serve and the opening set. Wawrinka was flat, striking not a single winner off his glorious single-handed backhand in the first set, and with less than an hour on the clock his task already looked forlorn. Nadal got a time violation at the start of the second, but Wawrinka could not slow the Spaniard's charge as he bounded into a 3-0 lead in the second having won seven games in a row. With the crowd attempting to lift Wawrinka he stopped the rot to hold, firing himself up with a roar of  C'mon . Nadal was relentless though, pinning Wawrinka back behind the baseline. Even when he was stretched the response was emphatic, one astonishing forehand, whipped from close to the front row of seats to land in a blur of yellow in the corner, drawing gasps from the crowd and applause from Wawrinka. Social media lit up at that point with women's semi-finalist Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland tweeting  OMG!  Wawrinka, who had been on an 11-match winning streak on clay, was being hunted down mercilessly and his frustration boiled over as the Spaniard closed in on a two-set lead, the Swiss wrecking his racket frame after a missed forehand. A brief lull as the court staff watered down the red dust failed to extinguish Nadal's fire and, despite Wawrinka's best efforts to extend the contest, the final set was little more than a coronation for Paris's favorite Spaniard.

Fitch Ratings Indonesia has also affirmed Japfa's National Long-Term Rating at 'AA-(idn)' with a Stable Outlook. A complete list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. Japfa plans a tap of its USD150 million 5.5% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2022, which have also been affirmed at 'BB-'. The company intends to use the proceeds mainly to repay its existing working capital loans, and for capex and other corporate purposes. Japfa's annualised leverage, measured by net debt to EBITDA, increased to 2.3x at end1Q17 from 0.9x at end-2016 due to weaker profitability. This brings it close to the 2.5x level at which Fitch would consider a negative rating action, but we believe it should moderate with improved profitability from 2Q17. Factors important to our Stable Outlook include sustained government intervention to maintain a demand-supply balance for chicken in Indonesia and Japfa's ability to pass-through costs to customers in its animal feed segment. 'AA' National Ratings denote expectations of very low default risk relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country. The default risk inherently differs only slightly from that of the country's highest-rated issuers or obligations. KEY RATING DRIVERS Profitability to Improve from 2Q17: Japfa's EBITDA margin declined by more than our expectations to 6.6% in 1Q17, from 13.1% in 2016 and 8.4% in 1Q16. Japfa incurred an operating loss for its commercial farming segment (40% of external revenue, 30% of gross) due to an oversupply of broiler chickens that resulted in weaker prices, while margins in the animal feed segment (37% of external revenue, 46% of gross) were squeezed by higher raw-material costs. We believe margins will improve from 2Q17 based on government directives to poultry companies to reduce the domestic chicken supply and Japfa's ability to pass-through higher costs in the animal feed segment. However, we expect margins to remain below the 2016 level. Government Directives to Manage Supply: The Indonesian government in late March 2017 directed the poultry industry to reduce the supply of day-old chicks. Following a government directive in October 2015, the industry culled around 3 million birds (parent stock), which was the main driver of improved profitability for Japfa and other poultry companies in 2016. We think that the latest government directive, if properly implemented, should result in a better industry demand-supply balance and improved margins for the breeding and commercial farming segments from 2Q17. Domestic Sourcing Raises Costs: The government has also introduced restrictions on the import of corn, a key raw material for animal feed, to encourage domestic sourcing of corn. Japfa, which used to import around 30% of its needs, is now required to seek government approval for imports. This has reduced its raw-material sourcing flexibility and increased costs due to higher local corn prices given increased demand. The company plans to invest in additional corn drying and storage facilities to prepare for increased domestic procurement, as corn harvesting in Indonesia normally happens only in the first and third quarters of the year. Cost Pass-Through Ability: Japfa is able to mitigate risk from rising raw-material costs through a strong ability to pass through cost increases to customers in the key animal-feed segment. This is due to its high market share and its ability to retain corn inventory and adjust output. PT Charoen Pokphand Indonesia Tbk (CPIN) and Japfa together control about 50% of Indonesia's poultry feed market, and react similarly to increases in raw material costs by seeking to raise prices. Japfa's corn dryers also allow it to store dried corn for up to four months, providing some flexibility in production. Higher Capex Expected in 2017: Japfa is planning to increase its spending to over IDR1.5 trillion in 2017 from around IDR800 billion in 2016. The higher capex is aimed at increasing corn drying and storage capacity for the animal feed segment, and expanding its market share in the breeding and commercial farming segments where the company sees an opportunity due its cost efficiencies. However, Japfa has flexibility to delay its capex plans based on market conditions and cash flows, especially for the breeding and commercial farming segments. Moderate Leverage: We expect Japfa's leverage to remain at around 2.0x on average over 2017-19, after factoring in higher capex in 2017, moderation in EBITDA margin from 2017 from the 2016 level and the tap issue. We also estimate Japfa's free cash flows to improve from 2018, after being negative in 2017, and fixed-charge cover to average more than 4x over 2017-19. DERIVATION SUMMARY Japfa's IDR can be compared with that of Fufeng Group Limited (Fufeng, BB+/Stable), which is largest producer of monosodium glutamate globally. Fufeng enjoys advantages such as economies of scale, integrated facilities and proximity to raw materials that are difficult to replicate. These advantages justify Fufeng's higher rating than Japfa's. Japfa's National Rating can be compared with that of PT Sumber Alfaria Trijaya Tbk (Alfamart, AA-(idn)/Stable) which benefits from its solid position as Indonesia's largest mini market operator by number of stores. It accounts for about 30% of modern retail revenue in the country. Alfamart is bigger in terms of revenues and EBITDA, but these advantages are offset by Japfa's higher margins and a better projected leverage profile. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Animal-feed sales volume to rise by 3% annually from 2017 - Average annual sales volume growth of 3%-5% for day-old chicks and live poultry from 2017 - EBITDA margin of around 8% in 2017 and 9% from 2018 - Capex of around IDR1.5 trillion in 2017 and around IDR900 billion annually thereafter RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - Leverage (net debt/EBITDA) below 1.5x on a sustained basis (2016: 0.9x) - No significant weakening of industry fundamentals and Japfa's market position Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Leverage above 2.5x on a sustained basis - Significant reduction in size of the animal-feed segment, which would be demonstrated by its share of total revenue falling below 30% (2016: 36%) LIQUIDITY Japfa had IDR7.2 trillion of debt and IDR3.3 trillion of cash at end-March 2017. Out of total debt, IDR5.5 trillion was long-term debt comprising of unsecured US dollar- and rupiah-denominated bonds. The company used its cash balance to redeem IDR2.6trillion of US dollar bonds in 2Q17. The remaining bond maturities are relatively spread out, with IDR850 billion maturing in 2019 and the remaining in 2021-22. We believe that Japfa should not face any significant issues in addressing its debt maturities based on our expectation of improving free cash flows and its access to diverse funding sources.

Sterling last traded at $1.2756, edging up 0.1 percent on the day, after sliding 1.7 percent on Friday, its biggest one-day drop in around eight months. The pound had tumbled by as much as 2.5 percent in the previous session to its lowest since mid-April after no single party won a clear claim to power in the UK election on Thursday - a result flagged by some analysts as the worst possible election outcome due to uncertainty. May is now trying to unite a disillusioned party around her to not only support her in the Brexit talks but also to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish party that will enable her to stay in power.  There is still heightened uncertainty surrounding issues, including how the (British government's) stance toward Brexit talks might change,  said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX strategist for Barclays in Tokyo.  The lack of moves (in sterling) is more because the market is waiting for fresh information, rather than a sign that it is settling down,  he added. Negotiations on Britain's exit from the European Union are due to start next Monday. While sterling has retreated as investors with long positions moved back towards neutral, there is no reason to expect further weakness simply because of the election result, said Andrew Milligan, Edinburgh-based head of global strategy for Standard Life Investments.  On valuation grounds, sterling is about fair value versus the other major currencies, so to see a much cheaper currency would require considerable new news on either the state of the UK economy or on the state of Brexit negotiations.  Milligan added that it is  far too soon  to say how the election results may affect the Brexit talks. The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1208, staying below a seven-month high of $1.1285 set in early June. The euro showed little reaction, after projections following the first round of French parliamentary elections on Sunday showed that President Emmanuel Macron's fledgling party was set to secure a huge majority. The outcome of initial results was in line with expectations. The dollar held steady at 110.29 yen, having retreated from Friday's one-week high of 110.815 yen. Analysts said the dollar could come under pressure against the yen, if falls in U.S. technology shares deepen after the sell-off seen on Friday, when the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 1.8 percent.  If it spills over into broader (U.S.) stock indices, that could trigger risk-off moves and put downward pressure on the dollar against the yen,  said Hirofumi Suzuki, economist for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. A key focus for markets this week is the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting that ends on Wednesday. With the Fed widely expected to raise interest rates, investors' focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of further tightening in the months to come and next year, and any further details on its plans for trimming its balance sheet.

Franco, 25, was knocked out in the eighth round with a hard right from Caro. He was rushed to hospital and underwent emergency surgery to stop two brain bleeds. He was placed in a medically induced coma.  At this point the doctors have told us the next 48 hours will be critical in regards to him making a complete recovery,  manager Ray Chaparro said in a statement.  We ask for prayers from the boxing community at this time.  Chaparro said doctors had to open Franco's skull in order to relieve the pressure and repair two small veins that were bleeding. Franco (16-2-3, 11 knockouts) absorbed several hard shots from Haro (14-1-1, eight KOs) through the fight and staggered in the sixth round. Before the fight ended, he was knocked down in the eighth but beat the count. The next shot landed near Franco's temple, and he immediately fell to the canvas. Moments later, Franco appeared alert while getting medical attention, but as the result of the fight was being announced, he lay down on the mat and was removed from the ring on a stretcher. Franco was handed his first career defeat in a third-round knockout by Christopher Martin on March 23. He rebounded with a first-round knockout win over Francisco Agustin Suarez on May 12 before taking on Haro.

The second-biggest party in the country's parliament on Saturday picked Halla-aho as its new leader in a move set to take the moderately nationalist party into a more radical right-wing populism. Halla-aho, who sees Finland better off outside the European Union, was fined by Finland's Supreme Court in 2012 for comments on a blog that linked Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft. A member of the European Parliament, Halla-aho has proposed sanctions against organizations that rescue refugees and immigrants from the Mediterranean, saying it encourages movement from Africa to Europe. Prime Minister Juha Sipila from the Center Party on Saturday said there was a risk the coalition could break up, and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo from pro-EU National Coalition Party (NCP) has also cast doubt on the government's future. Sipila is due to meet with Orpo and Halla-aho at 0700 GMT, and parties may hold their own meetings after that.  As snap elections are very rare in the Nordic country, a break-up of the coalition would likely mean that Sipila would try to form a new coalition. Some politicians and analysts said a break-up looked likely.  Liberal democracy and a western conception of man must be defended now... National Coalition Party can not continue in the same government with the Finns Party,  said Jan Vapaavuori, Helsinki mayor and an influential figure in the NCP, in a blog. In case of a break-up, one possible way forward for Sipila is to replace the Finns party with two small opposition parties, the Swedish People's Party and Christian Democrats. That would leave the new coalition with a very narrow parliament majority of 101 seats out of 200. Finland has been run by coalition governments with strong majorities for decades. For Sipila, at stake is a major healthcare and local government reforms central to his plan to balance public finances. The coalition, half-way through its four-year tenure, has outlined the reform but has yet to agree on details.  The government's decision-making had weakened already before this situation... The current fiscal plans will be watered down in any case,  said Jan Von Gerich, analyst at Nordea.  With the Swedish People's Party and the Christian Democrats, they could keep some of their current plans on track.

The private reading at Orlando's Pulse nightclub at 2:02 a.m. is the first in a series of events at which victims' names will be memorialized with performances, prayers and candlelight vigils scheduled across the country on  Orlando United Day.  On the first anniversary of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, local officials have asked Americans to join in acts of  love and kindness  to honor victims of the three-hour rampage at the now-shuttered gay club on June 12, 2016, including survivors still reeling from emotional and physical wounds.  Following the Pulse tragedy, we showed the world that Orlando would not be defined by the act of a hate-filled killer,  Mayor Buddy Dyer wrote in a blog post,  but instead defined by our response of love, compassion and unity.  The gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, opened fire shortly after the last call for drinks on the club's popular Latin night. He gunned down patrons on the dance floor and sprayed bullets at others cowering in bathroom stalls. Holding hostages during his standoff with police, Mateen claimed allegiance to a leader of the Islamic State militant group before dying in an exchange of gunfire with authorities. His widow, Noor Salman, was arrested in January on federal charges of aiding and abetting Mateen's attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organization, and lying to authorities investigating the massacre. She was not present for the attack and has pleaded not guilty. Along with the events in Orlando, vigils and rallies were planned across the United States in a show of solidarity with victims of the attack, which authorities called a hateful act against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. On social media, supporters sought to call attention to their legacy with a campaign using the tag #HonorThemWithAction. The Center, an LGBT advocacy group in Orlando, asked supporters to post photos of their events so survivors and the relatives of victims can see they have not been forgotten.  A big part of the healing process is to see, 'I am not alone in this,'  said Terry DeCarlo, its executive director.

Cypress Semi's founder and former CEO T.J. Rodgers has been running a proxy contest against the company, seeking to replace Bingham and lead independent director Eric Benhamou. Rodgers has nominated veteran tech industry board directors Daniel McCranie and Camillo Martino.  While it saddens me to leave the board at such a time, I believe that the nature of this proxy contest has become a distraction to the company,  said Bingham. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc recommended on Tuesday that Cypress Semiconductor shareholders vote for both board nominees put forward by Rodgers. The recommendation urging shareholders to withhold their support only for Benhamou came as a blow to Bingham, who ISS had earlier supported. Benhamou has also stepped down as lead independent director, but will remain on the board, the company said. Cypress' board of directors, which has accepted Bingham's resignation, also appointed current independent director W. Steve Albrecht as its new chairman.
