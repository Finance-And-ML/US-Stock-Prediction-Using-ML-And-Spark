Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, expecting to repurchase them at lower prices and collect the difference as profit.Bearish investors say they are scaling back on these bets not because their view of the market has fundamentally changed, but because it is difficult to stick to a money-losing strategy when it seems stocks can only go up.They believe the market moves are at odds with an economy that remains lukewarm as it enters its ninth year of growth, stock valuations that are historically high and a delay of business-friendly policies in Washington like tax cuts and infrastructure spending.\u201cThere seems to be an overall view that people are invincible, that things will always go up, that there are no risks and no matter what goes on, no matter what foolishness is in play, people don\u2019t care,\u201d said Marc Cohodes, whose hedge fund focused on shorting stocks closed in 2008.Mr. Cohodes is now a chicken farmer based in California who is looking to get into goat herding in Canada. He shorts a handful of individual stocks personally, but isn\u2019t focused on the broader market.The practice of shorting companies is also going by the wayside as stocks continue to notch new records. Short-biased hedge funds had $4.3 billion in assets at the end of March, down from $7.1 billion at the end of 2013, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.The difficulty for stock-market bears stems from a Goldilocks-like market environment, where the economy is growing fast enough to support corporate earnings, but slow enough for the Federal Reserve to keep rates relatively low. Years of low rates and easy-money policies have boosted stocks, defying forecasts for a steep, prolonged downturn.\u201cThe shorts have been frustrated now for quite a while,\u201d said Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, which has $260 billion in assets under management. The scenarios that might lead to a payout for market bears\u2014an economic recession or a sharp rise in interest rates\u2014don\u2019t seem imminent, either, Mr. Minerd added.In one sign of capitulation among the bears, stock pullbacks have been getting shorter. This year, there have been two times when the S&P 500 has closed down 1% or more. After these two selloffs, it has taken stocks an average of 14.5 days to recoup losses. That is well below the 25.5 days it took on average to bounce back from stretches of 1%-plus selloffs in 2016 and the 80 days it took to rebound in 2015, according to an analysis by WSJ Market Data Group.The share of individual investors who are either bullish or bearish has also fallen in recent months, according to a weekly survey by the American Association of Individual Investors, while the share of those who are neutral has risen. As of the end of June, 43% of investors said they were neutral\u2014the most since last August.\u201cThe danger is that you\u2019re too early getting out,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management, which has $246 billion under management.The issue for investors, Mr. Ramos said, is that there remain few compelling alternatives to stocks.Bond yields have remained stubbornly low this year, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ending Thursday at 2.266%, down from 2.446% at the end of 2016.Central banks around the world in recent weeks have signaled they will move toward normalizing monetary policy, nudging bond yields higher. But few investors believe inflation will pick up so much that the Fed will be pressured into lifting rates faster than it has forecast\u2014a scenario that could lead to sharp market losses.At the same time, many who are invested in stocks are wary of signs that the bull market\u2019s days are numbered.Valuations have risen to levels many investors say are stretched, with the S&P 500 trading this week at 17.82 times the next 12 months of expected earnings, according to FactSet, above its 10-year average of 14.08 times forward earnings.Still, some who believe excesses are growing in the financial system say it is hard to convey those concerns to average investors. While signs of a housing bubble in the mid-2000s were abundant, indications that borrowing by companies will lead to a wave of defaults are more nuanced, according to Albert Edwards, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Mr. Edwards has been bearish for most of the bull market and believes a corporate-debt binge will ultimately lead to a deeper bear market than in the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s much harder this time to see the corporate-debt excesses,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a headline catcher. You have to be a bit geeky to pull apart the data and analyze it.\u201dDespite persistent concerns that investment-grade corporate bonds and junk debt are pricey, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of credit investors found that none of the respondents were significantly underweight either sector.In the week ended July 12, investors piled more than $3 billion into global equity funds, marking the seventh straight week of inflows for such funds, according to EPFR data.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of worry out there, but the market just keeps going up,\u201d Mr. Ramos said. \u201cWhen everyone agrees that it\u2019s time for this bull market to keep going, that\u2019s exactly the right time for the market rally to stop.\u201d\u2014Peter Levin contributed to this article.Write to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-21 05:30:00"}, {"keywords": "north korea, north korea travel ban, tourism, travel ban, u.s.,U.S. government,Otto Warmbier,political,general news,politics,international relations", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-ban-tourist-visits-to-north-korea-travel-agencies-say-1500627560", "news_title": "U.S. to Ban Tourist Visits to North Korea, Tour Operators Say ", "content": "SEOUL\u2014Two of the biggest travel companies that bring Western tourists to North Korea say the U.S. government will ban its citizens from traveling to the isolated country starting next month.The travel ban would come just weeks after U.S. college student       Otto Warmbier,        who was detained while on a tour in Pyongyang last year, died after he returned home in June with a severe brain injury.The two tour operators, China-based Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours, said Friday the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which handles U.S. diplomatic affairs in North Korea, had contacted them separately by phone to inform them of the U.S. decision.Officers at both companies said the Swedish Embassy told them the U.S. would make the announcement on Thursday next week, with the ban to take effect 30 days later, in late August. Violating the ban would lead to the U.S. government invalidating the traveler\u2019s passport, Young Pioneer said it was told.It is unclear whether the travel ban would also apply to humanitarian and educational work in North Korea.The U.S. Embassy in Seoul declined to comment. Calls and emails to the Swedish embassies in Pyongyang and Seoul weren\u2019t immediately answered.Young Pioneer stopped bringing U.S. tourists to North Korea last month following the death of Mr. Warmbier, who went to North Korea in late 2015 on a tour organized by the company.At least three Americans are being held in North Korea, though none was a tourist. Two are tied to a Christian university in Pyongyang.U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       told lawmakers last month that the U.S. was considering a ban on travel to North Korea but hadn\u2019t reached a decision.A bipartisan bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in May would ban tourism to North Korea and require any U.S. citizen going there for humanitarian and educational work to seek a license from the Treasury Department.About 5,000 Western tourists visit North Korea each year, with roughly one-fifth of them U.S. citizens, according to Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, which has been bringing visitors to North Korea since 1993.Tourists visiting North Korea aren\u2019t typically allowed to travel independently and generally join group tours, where they are closely chaperoned by representatives of official state entities.Tourism companies catering to the demands of tourists with less-conventional tastes have sprung up in recent years in the U.S., Europe, China and Australia. Most tours to North Korea last between three days and two weeks and are focused on Pyongyang, though some have included activities such as train travel, skiing and surfing.Mr. Cockerell said Friday that the travel ban would be \u201ca big blow to us,\u201d and it would likely reduce the willingness of other Western nationals to travel to North Korea.U.K.-incorporated Koryo Tours accounts for about 40% of the overall volume of Western tourists to North Korea, he estimates. Mr. Cockerell criticized the U.S. decision.\u201cAll interactions between North Koreans and Americans, who are very much demonized in the country, will grind to a halt, and the North Koreans will only be left with their own media to portray Americans as they like,\u201d he said.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-21 05:54:00"}, {"keywords": "aetna,aig, aig ceo,brian duperreault, catholic,chubb,cigna, faith,hank greenberg, insurance, insurance ceo, jesuit,American International Group,AIG,St. Joseph's University,Brian Duperreault,insurance,financial services", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-fort-knox-clerk-to-insurance-kingpin-the-rise-of-aigs-new-ceo-1500629400", "news_title": "From Fort Knox Clerk to Insurance Kingpin: The Rise of AIG\u2019s New CEO ", "content": "It would be hard to find anyone in insurance with a longer resume than             American International Group Inc.\u2019s        AIG -0.52%       new chief executive       Brian Duperreault.Mr. Duperreault started as an actuarial trainee at AIG in 1973, straight out of a postcollege stint in the U.S. Army. He rose through the company\u2019s ranks to become a senior executive, before leaving in 1994. Over the past 23 years, he has turned one niche offshore insurer into a large and diversified company, become CEO of a big industry brokerage and co-founded his own insurance firm.In returning to AIG, his plan is straightforward: Grow AIG.He thinks the company has shrunk enough after unloading a series of businesses to help repay a nearly $185 billion U.S. government bailout, and then selling more assets to finance share buybacks. Mr. Duperreault wants to expand in part through acquisitions as well as AIG\u2019s life and personal lines insurance businesses, particularly internationally.\u201cI [was] looking at my alma mater having issues,\u201d the 70-year-old said in his first extensive interview since taking the AIG job in May. \u201cMy head was saying, \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 because I had a great job. But my heart was telling me otherwise.\u201dOver the past few weeks, Mr. Duperreault has brought in executives from outside the company and plans to increase use of data science and predictive analytics, particularly as a way to expand sales to midsize businesses.Many of AIG\u2019s 56,400 employees are now meeting Mr. Duperreault for the first time through town halls in New York, Boston, Chicago, London and Dublin, so far. Among things they are learning: Their new boss has deep faith. A Roman Catholic who was educated by nuns in Trenton, N.J., he later attended the Jesuit-run St. Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia, Pa.\u201cFaith and family are the two things I wanted them to understand about me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important element of running a company is doing the right thing, and faith gives one the courage to do that.\u201dMr. Duperreault said he speaks publicly of his religious side \u201cwhen I am being asked about who I am.\u201d He has publicly thanked God for his successes, and keeps a Bible in his office for \u201cwhen I feel that I have to read it.\u201dMr. Duperreault didn\u2019t initially aim for an insurance career. He went to St. Joe\u2019s to study chemistry, but \u201cI just wasn\u2019t any good at lab work.\u201d He majored in math, then after college he enlisted in the Army during the Vietnam War and spent three years doing clerical work at Fort Knox, Ky.Upon discharge, job choices were limited with a stalled U.S. economy. Actuaries were in demand.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about actuarial science,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I know is, I needed a job.\u201dHe was hired at AIG, then a midsize property-casualty insurer, in the early stages of its transformation into one of the world\u2019s largest financial-services firms by its CEO, Maurice R. \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg.Mr. Duperreault\u2019s first assignment was to create divorce insurance that would guarantee income should a marriage fail. While that product wasn\u2019t launched, he eventually became a key lieutenant of the legendarily hard-charging Mr. Greenberg.Mr. Duperreault said he left AIG in 1994 to determine if he had \u201cthe wherewithal to stand alone and succeed\u201d without Mr. Greenberg.In an interview, Mr. Greenberg said he is pleased to see Mr. Duperreault back at AIG, calling him \u201ca good choice.\u201d Mr. Greenberg left AIG in 2005 and now runs insurance and investment firm Starr Cos.Mr. Duperreault replaced       Peter Hancock,        who lost his hold on the CEO job earlier this year after delaying profit-improvement deadlines. Mr. Hancock had been narrowing AIG\u2019s focus through divestitures.\u201cI think Brian is wise in getting rid of that liquidation strategy,\u201d said Mr. Greenberg, referring to Mr. Hancock\u2019s divestitures. Turning around AIG \u201cwill take time, and you have to have a strategy to differentiate AIG from other companies. He\u2019s had a lot of training, been in the industry a long time. But time will tell.\u201dMr. Duperreault\u2019s first job outside of AIG was as CEO of             ACE Ltd.      , which back then was a liability-insurance specialist. The job returned him to his birthplace: Bermuda, where he was born to American parents. Over the next decade, he diversified and expanded ACE through acquisitions. In 2004, he stepped down as CEO and became nonexecutive chairman.In 2008, he became CEO of then-struggling brokerage and consulting firm             Marsh & McLennan Co      s. He cut costs, strengthened management and acquired smaller firms to bolster growth. He left in 2012.The following year, while on a dinner cruise in Hamilton, Bermuda, he mentioned still having \u201cgas in the tank\u201d to insurance executive David Brown. Mr. Brown knew that hedge fund Two Sigma Investments, a leader in quantitative analysis, was looking to get into insurance, and he put Mr. Duperreault in contact with them.That led to Mr. Duperreault co-founding Hamilton Insurance Group in 2013 with Two Sigma\u2019s principals. As part of Mr. Duperreault\u2019s new job, a Two Sigma affiliate aims to work with AIG on an insurance platform.AIG today is far different than the one Mr. Duperreault left in 1994. Gone to repay its bailout are Asian life-insurance operations, aircraft leasing and other crown jewels. Also gone are some former rivals such as             Aetna Inc.       and             Cigna Corp.      , which divested property-casualty units. New competition has emerged, including             Chubb Ltd.       That insurer is the former ACE and is run by Hank Greenberg\u2019s son Evan, who succeeded Mr. Duperreault at ACE.\u201cYou need to have great rivalries to make you better,\u201d Mr. Duperreault said. \u201cSo it\u2019s actually a wonderful thing, in a way, that they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re so good because it\u2019s going to make us better.\u201dWrite to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-21 05:30:00"}, {"keywords": " affordable care act, bill, capitol hill, donald trump,health bill, health-care, medicaid, mitch mcconnell, obamacare, republicans, rob portman, seema verma, senate,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,Seema Verma,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-floats-proposal-to-ease-medicaid-cuts-1500594788", "news_title": "GOP Floats Proposal to Ease Medicaid Cuts", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Senate Republicans, scrambling to win support for their health-care bill, pushed a measure Thursday that they said could ease the impact of the bill\u2019s Medicaid cuts on low-income people.Advocating for the new direction is a little-known health official who is now at the center of the health-care fight: Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the two federal medical programs.Ms. Verma has recently become ubiquitous on Capitol Hill, meeting with wavering senators one-on-one, speaking to groups of Republicans and citing her experience as an Indiana state official to argue the GOP proposals can work.The Medicaid plan that is being advanced by some Republicans and Ms. Verma would use funds from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s taxes to cut out-of-pocket costs for people who are forced to leave Medicaid due to cutbacks in the Republican bill.It wasn\u2019t clear Thursday whether Ms. Verma\u2019s pitch would attract any of the GOP senators who said they were opposed to an earlier version of the bill, let alone enough to let the bill squeak through. But at least one senator who has voiced concerns about the bill\u2019s Medicaid cuts said Ms. Verma has taken a careful approach by providing data without overselling her proposal.\u201cShe\u2019s not in the business of lobbying, but she\u2019s in the business of getting us good information,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) said.Sen.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.) said, \u201cShe\u2019s obviously a knowledgeable person who\u2019s implemented innovative programs...That gives a great deal of street credibility.\u201dSen.       Susan Collins       of Maine, one of the Republicans who is opposed to the GOP bill, said she wasn\u2019t convinced by the pitch because the amount going to consumers would fall far short of the bill\u2019s $756 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid funding over a decade. Under the plan, up to $200 billion from the taxes would go to support affected low-income people.\u201cIf you\u2019re still going to take more than $700 billion out of the Medicaid program, you still have significant problems,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Administration officials, including Mr. Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price,        have visited Capitol Hill in recent days. Republican senators have frequently cited Ms. Verma as providing detailed arguments for the GOP bill.Still, Medicaid cuts are only one issue cited by Republicans concerned about the bill. Some worry about losing consumer protections; others fear premiums won\u2019t be reduced enough.Under the latest version of the Republican health bill, the number of uninsured would increase by 22 million in 2026, compared with the current law, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office released Thursday. Federal deficits would shrink by $420 billion over the coming decade, the CBO estimated.With President       Donald Trump       signaling Wednesday that the administration will play a more aggressive role in wrangling 50 senators to support the bill, it appears Ms. Verma, a 46-year-old daughter of Indian-American immigrants, will play a large role in the coming days.Ms. Verma cut her teeth professionally as a consultant to states, including Indiana, that introduced conservative changes to their Medicaid programs through a complex waiver process.On Monday, Ms. Verma met with Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.) and Mr. Portman. She met Wednesday morning with Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W.Va.), and that evening with about 20 senators gathered in the Capitol.At White House and Senate meetings Wednesday, Ms. Verma discussed the Medicaid provision at length. She has also been showing every senator numbers to illustrate how funds and waivers could affect their state, according to a person close to Ms. Verma. The goal is convincing them that the program could be put on a stable footing without hurting individuals, this person said.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who presides over the chamber\u2019s 52 Republicans, can lose only two GOP votes, with Mr. Pence casting a tiebreaking vote if necessary. His task has been complicated by Wednesday\u2019s announcement that Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) has been diagnosed with brain cancer; it isn\u2019t clear when he might return to Washington.The health debate has drawn Ms. Verma into an unfamiliar limelight, and White House officials said they are counting on her persuasiveness. They said they struggled in early phases of the House debate because Ms. Verma hadn\u2019t yet been confirmed, and they credit her with winning over House members at later stages.But many remain skeptical of her Medicaid proposal. Democrats and some Republicans said a one-time infusion of money, which aides and lawmakers said would likely be between $160 billion and $200 billion, wouldn\u2019t make up for far larger cuts to Medicaid over a longer period.\u201cThat\u2019s one of those tiny Band-Aids that you use for a child\u2019s cut,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.). \u201cI would hope that won\u2019t win over any votes just to postpone the pain for a couple years or a couple months.\u201dSenate leaders say they expect to vote next week on a motion allowing them to begin debate on a health bill. But if Ms. Verma\u2019s proposal looks like it is picking up votes, GOP leaders could delay the vote to gather more support.One of Ms. Verma\u2019s few public appearances not related to health care came at a White House event in May celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.She talked about growing up in the U.S. at a time when people confused Indians with Native Americans, asking her what tribe she was from.She remembered her mother ruining silk saris by putting them in a U.S. washing machine. And she joked about her father\u2019s criticism of her 95% score on a test and\u2014years later\u2014her son\u2019s score of 89% on a math test that her daughter dubbed an \u201cAsian fail.\u201dThe U.S. is different now, she said. People now ask her which part of India her family is from, and they associate India with yoga and meditation, \u201cwhich I can say I haven\u2019t done much of\u201d lately.\u2014Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-20 19:53:00"}, {"keywords": "election ,fbi,hacking,intelligence committee,manafort,money laundering,russia,special counsel,trump,Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,The Senate,the Treasury Department,Paul Manafort,Jared Kushner,Donald Trump,Robert Mueller,political,general news,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/special-counsel-investigating-possible-money-laundering-by-paul-manafort-1500587532", "news_title": "Special Counsel Investigating Possible Money Laundering by Paul Manafort ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       is investigating possible money laundering by       Paul Manafort,       Donald Trump\u2019s      \u00a0former campaign manager, as part of his criminal investigation into what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, according to a person familiar with the matter.The inquiry into the issue by Mr. Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and his team began several weeks ago, this person said.\u00a0A spokesman for Mr. Manafort,       Jason Maloni,        declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Mueller.Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation is focusing on Russian meddling as well as whether any members of the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion and described investigations into the issue a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Russia has denied meddling.The Senate and House intelligence committees also are probing possible money laundering by Mr. Manafort, according to people with knowledge of those investigations.The Senate committee also has received reports from the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which tracks illicit money flows, to learn if any of Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses may have financial ties to Russian interests, these people said. Mr. Trump has said he has no such ties.Mr. Manafort, a Republican political consultant, spent years working for a pro-Russia party in Ukraine.

Messrs. Schneiderman and Vance are Democrats.Mr. Manafort has spent and borrowed tens of millions of dollars in connection with properties in the U.S. over the past decade, including a Brooklyn, N.Y., townhouse and California properties being developed by his son-in-law, the Journal has reported.Through his spokesman, Mr. Manafort has said his \u201cpersonal investments in real estate are all ordinary business transactions.\u201dIn April, before Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel, the Justice Department requested Mr. Manafort\u2019s banking records as part of the Russia probe that is now being led by Mr. Mueller, the Journal reported.And earlier this month, the Journal reported that the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office had subpoenaed records relating to up to $16 million in loans that a bank run by       Steve Calk,        a former campaign economic adviser to Mr. Trump, made to Mr. Manafort.Mr. Manafort and two other top Trump campaign aides\u2014Donald Trump Jr. and the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser,       Jared Kushner      \u2014are expected to speak with Senate committees next week as part of their inquiries.\u2014Shane Harris and Aruna Viswanatha contributed to this article.Write to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 17:52:00"}, {"keywords": " communications director,the mooch, trump administration, white house press office,Anthony Scaramucci,Donald Trump,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,audiovisual production,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,media,entertainment", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/financier-anthony-scaramucci-to-be-named-white-house-communications-director-1500607948", "news_title": "Financier Anthony Scaramucci Likely to Be Named White House Communications Director", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Financier       Anthony Scaramucci,        a top donor to President       Donald Trump       during the campaign, is expected to be named White House communications director on Friday, two White House officials said.Mr. Scaramucci, 53 years old, is the founder of hedge-fund investing firm SkyBridge Capital and a hedge-fund conference known as SALT. Known as \u201cThe Mooch,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci previously hosted a financial TV show on             Fox Business Network                   and has been a frequent guest advocating for Mr. Trump on cable news shows.Mr. Scaramucci didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Separately,       Marc Kasowitz,        Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney who is representing him in Special Counsel       Robert Mueller\u2019s       probe of the links of the president\u2019s associates to Russia, is expected to take on a lesser role on Mr. Trump\u2019s outside legal team, according to a person familiar with the shift.Mr. Kasowitz\u2019s spokesman, Mark Corallo, resigned from his post this week after less than two months on the job, according to a person familiar with his decision, after privately expressing frustration over the administration\u2019s handling of episodes such as the revelation of a meeting Donald Trump Jr. arranged in June 2016 between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer.Mr. Corallo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Scaramucci, who worked at             Goldman Sachs                   and graduated from Harvard Law School, would join a communications office that has been a target of criticism from Republicans in Washington and Mr. Trump himself.The White House has been seeking a communications director since       Mike Dubke      resigned from the role at the end of May, \u200bas the president aimed to reset his administration amid expanding probes into his associates\u2019 ties to Russia. Mr. Scaramucci had been a top candidate for the role of director for the Office of Public Liaison before it was given to       George Sifakis.Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s new job was first reported by Axios.com.The president has complained privately that the press team has been at times too slow or ineffective in defending him, most notably following his firing of former FBI director       James Comey.       But some White House officials counter that the West Wing has a problem with decision making, not public relations. Several people approached by White House officials have turned down offers to join the team, people familiar with the conversations said.Since Mr. Dubke resigned, press secretary       Sean Spicer       has been filling in for the role of communications director, while deputy press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       has taken over at the podium for most White House briefings, which have been off-camera since late last month.Mr. Scaramucci was active during the 2016 presidential race. After having originally supported Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker for the Republican presidential nomination, and then former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, he threw his support behind Mr. Trump and became one of his most vocal supporters.Mr. Scaramucci is serving as chief strategist at the U.S. Export Import Bank. His appointment to that role followed months of uncertainty about Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s prospects of joining the White House, after a promised role in the White House was handed to someone else.The move to shift Mr. Scaramucci to the communications team comes as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are crafting a strategy that aims to contain Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation and ensure it doesn\u2019t veer into Mr. Trump\u2019s private business dealings.\u201cThe special counsel\u2019s investigatory activities are limited by his mandate. And looking at a real-estate deal from 10 years ago would exceed that mandate,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, referencing a Bloomberg story that said Mr. Mueller is looking into Trump business deals dating back years.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers also would be looking at potential conflicts of interest in the Mueller legal team, Mr. Sekulow said. \u201cConflict of interest issues, if they arise, will be addressed in due course through the normal legal channels if we get to that stage. Any lawyer would look at potential conflicts,\u201d he said.The recourse for Trump\u2019s legal team would be to first approach Mr. Mueller and then the deputy attorney general overseeing the investigation,       Rod Rosenstein,        Mr. Sekulow said. \u200bMr. Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment.Write to Michael C.

In its campaign, Big Tobacco has unusual supporters: some public-health advocates.Many scientists agree that moist, smokeless tobacco, including chewing and dipping tobacco, is significantly less harmful than cigarettes. But rather than encouraging the country\u2019s 37 million smokers to switch to less risky products, U.S. health officials have so far stuck with an abstinence-only message in communications with the public.Online fact sheets published by the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute list multiple health risks associated with smokeless tobacco\u2014including cancers of the mouth, esophagus, and pancreas\u2014but give no indication it is less harmful than cigarettes. \u201cThere is no safe form of tobacco,\u201d the cancer institute says on its website.\u201cThe \u2018not safe\u2019 message is not enough,\u201d said Lynn Kozlowski, a public health professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo. \u201cThe risk of tragedy from keeping people in the dark is much greater than the risk of tragedy from informing people.\u201dMr. Kozlowski is one of several academics and public-health experts advocating for U.S. health agencies to provide the public with information on the relative risks of tobacco products.The Truth Initiative, a U.S. antismoking group, has embraced the so-called \u201charm reduction\u201d approach, encouraging smokers who are unable to quit to switch to products such as Swedish-style tobacco pouches called snus or \u201cproperly regulated\u201d e-cigarettes.The debate is coming to a head as the Food and Drug Administration considers whether to approve new marketing claims for smokeless tobacco and other products.In April,             Reynolds American Inc.       submitted applications to market six styles of Camel Snus tobacco pouches as being less harmful than cigarettes.             Philip Morris International Inc.       also has an application pending for a new device that heats tobacco instead of burning it. The FDA is expected to decide next year whether Philip Morris can say on labels and in marketing materials that switching from cigarettes to its IQOS device significantly cuts exposure to harmful chemicals and the risk of tobacco-related diseases.\u201cNewer and more novel forms of delivering nicotine\u2026could be incredibly helpful to curtail cigarette smoking if [smokers] completely switched,\u201d said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. He declined to discuss any pending health-claim applications, but noted smokeless tobacco poses lower health risks. \u201cWe have to have an open mind.\u201d\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not nicotine that causes disease and death,\u201d he said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be thinking about various forms of nicotine delivery?\u201dThe FDA will make its decision after recommendations are made by agency scientists and an independent advisory board.Smokeless tobacco in the U.S. has been associated in multiple studies with oral cancer, heart disease and other illnesses. But what kills 480,000 people in the U.S. each year is the cigarette smoke that carries harmful compounds into the lungs. Federal officials caution that publicizing the relative risks of smokeless tobacco could lead to unintended consequences, such as greater uptake among youth.\u201cThe best way to fully protect yourself from these risks is to completely quit the use of any tobacco products,\u201d said Brian King, a deputy director in the CDC\u2019s Office on Smoking and Health.A federal law passed in 2009 made it illegal for tobacco companies to make health claims unless given permission by the FDA. In December, the agency partially rejected an application by             Swedish Match North America Inc.       to market its General brand tobacco pouches as less harmful than cigarettes. The FDA invited Swedish Match to revise its proposed health claims.In Sweden, the smoking rate has plummeted to 7%\u2014the lowest in the European Union\u2014as many men switched to snus. Men in Sweden now have a lower tobacco-related death rate than in any other EU country.Reynolds and             Altria Group Inc.,       which make the Grizzly and Copenhagen brands, respectively, command 80% of the $8.7 billion smokeless-tobacco market in the U.S., which has been growing even as cigarette consumption has declined.At recent scientific conferences, Altria has presented an analysis of two federal surveys showing that users of moist, smokeless tobacco were at least 90% less likely to die over the course of the surveys than cigarette smokers. The U.S. data included nearly 387,000 survey respondents. Altria now is preparing this analysis for submission to an academic journal.\u201cWe think it is important to contribute to scientific understanding of tobacco harm reduction,\u201d an Altria spokesman said.In interviews, federal health officials said more research needs to be done on the potential population-level consequences of broadcasting the fact that some tobacco products are safer than cigarettes.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at a point yet where we can give specific recommendations for harm reduction,\u201d said Mark Parascandola, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly getting closer.\u201dWrite to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-21 05:30:00"}]
