In May of that year, the Treasury Department said the company signed eight documents relating to oil and gas projects in Russia that were also signed by       Igor Sechin,        chief executive of the state oil giant PAO Rosneft. The Treasury said Thursday those deals violated U.S. sanctions against Mr. Sechin, a former Russian intelligence officer and ally to President       Vladimir Putin.Mr. Tillerson, who had close business ties to Russia and received an \u201cOrder of Friendship\u201d award from Moscow, left Exxon last year to become U.S. secretary of state.The $2 million fine, the Treasury said, was the maximum amount it could levy against the company.A spokesman for Exxon called the fine \u201coutrageous\u201d and said it would fight the Treasury\u2019s findings, saying they are a 180-degree turn from previous guidance handed down by the Obama administration when the sanctions were enacted. The Treasury\u2019s sanctions unit started its probe of the alleged sanctions violation several years ago. Exxon said it was first notified in 2015 by the sanctions unit, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, that it had violated sanctions regarding its interactions with Mr. Sechin. In a filing in a Texas court Thursday, the company said it had challenged the notification about a month later.Exxon doesn\u2019t have any direct deals with Mr. Sechin but does have business dealings with Rosneft, where Mr. Sechin signed company documents in his capacity as CEO, Exxon said. According to the company, under President       Barack Obama,        the White House and the Treasury in 2014 said U.S. companies were allowed to participate in business dealings with Mr. Sechin if they were professional, not personal.On Thursday afternoon, the Irving, Texas, company filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, seeking to toss the fine. In a court filing, Exxon said the sanctions unit \u201cseeks to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order that is inconsistent with the explicit and unambiguous guidance from the White House and the Treasury issued before the relevant conduct and still publicly available today.\u201dThe Justice Department declined to comment about Exxon\u2019s legal challenge.The U.S. Treasury said in an enforcement notice against Exxon that the company showed \u201creckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements\u201d when failing to consider the warning signs associated with dealing in the blocked services of someone under U.S. sanctions. The Treasury unit said one of the \u201caggravating factors\u201d it considered was that Exxon is a globally sophisticated company that routinely deals with sanctions compliance concerns.\u201cNo materials issued by the White House or the Department of the Treasury asserted an exception or carve-out for the professional conduct of designated or blocked persons, nor did any materials suggest that U.S. persons could continue to conduct or engage in business with such individuals,\u201d the Thursday notice said.When Mr. Tillerson took his position in President       Donald Trump\u2019s       cabinet this year, he promised to recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year. He has stood by the current sanctions regime. In Ukraine earlier this month, Mr. Tillerson said the U.S. sanctions on Russia\u2014imposed along with sanctions from the European Union\u2014would remain \u201cuntil Moscow reverses the actions that triggered these particular sanctions.\u201dMr. Tillerson, as Mr. Trump\u2019s top diplomat, has been leading administration efforts to improve relations with Russia.\u201cThis is a big black eye for Tillerson,\u201d said Anders \u00c5slund, a senior fellow and Russia expert at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank and Russia critic.Though the State Department referred most questions about this specific matter to Exxon, spokeswoman       Heather Nauert       said Thursday that Mr. Tillerson is committed to the objectives of the Ukraine-related sanctions. She said the State Department wasn\u2019t involved with the decision to fine Exxon. She said Mr. Tillerson is \u201cliving up to his ethical commitments,\u201d including his recusal from Exxon-related matters.Rosneft spokesman Michael Leontiev said signing an agreement with Mr. Sechin not as an individual, but as a representative of Rosneft management, can\u2019t be the foundation for a sanctions violation. \u201cI am sure that while Exxon was preparing the decision about documents signing it consulted with both OFAC and lawyers specialized on sanctions very carefully,\u201d he said.The penalty comes as committees in the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as a Justice Department special counsel, investigate what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to interfere in the presidential election, and whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Russia has denied meddling and Mr. Trump has denied any collusion.\u201cExxon Mobil caused significant harm to the Ukraine-related sanctions program objectives by engaging the services\u201d of a sanctioned entity, the Treasury said.Exxon applied to the Treasury Department for a partial waiver from Russia sanctions in 2015. The application was never acted upon at that time but was again circulating among government departments earlier this year. The Trump administration said in April that it wouldn\u2019t grant the waiver, two days after the application was reported by The Wall Street Journal.Exxon and other big energy companies also recently joined Mr. Trump in voicing concerns about congressional efforts to toughen sanctions on Russia, arguing that it could shut down oil and gas projects around the world that involve Russian partners. Mr. Tillerson opposed ramped-up sanctions being considered in Congress, saying the White House needs flexibility on the matter.Lobbyists for Exxon told lawmakers in recent weeks that several provisions in the sanctions legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill are worrisome, including measures to prohibit partnerships with Russian individuals.\u2014Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Lynn Cook at lynn.cook@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. and Exxon Spar Over Russia Sanctions.'", "news_title": "U.S. and Exxon Spar Over Russia Sanctions Violation "}, {"keywords": "election ,fbi,hacking,intelligence committee,manafort,money laundering,russia,special counsel,trump,Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,The Senate,the Treasury Department,Paul Manafort,Jared Kushner,Donald Trump,Robert Mueller,political,general news,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections", "news_time": "2017-07-20 17:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/special-counsel-investigating-possible-money-laundering-by-paul-manafort-1500587532", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       is investigating possible money laundering by       Paul Manafort,       Donald Trump\u2019s      \u00a0former campaign manager, as part of his criminal investigation into what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, according to a person familiar with the matter.The inquiry into the issue by Mr. Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and his team began several weeks ago, this person said.\u00a0A spokesman for Mr. Manafort,       Jason Maloni,        declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Mueller.Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation is focusing on Russian meddling as well as whether any members of the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion and described investigations into the issue a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Russia has denied meddling.The Senate and House intelligence committees also are probing possible money laundering by Mr. Manafort, according to people with knowledge of those investigations.The Senate committee also has received reports from the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which tracks illicit money flows, to learn if any of Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses may have financial ties to Russian interests, these people said. Mr. Trump has said he has no such ties.Mr. Manafort, a Republican political consultant, spent years working for a pro-Russia party in Ukraine.

AMZN 0.18%       In its fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft notched gains in its Azure cloud-computing business and Office 365, the online version of its widely used productivity software.The Redmond, Wash., company said Thursday that its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, rose 11% to $7.4 billion. In the Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes the Office franchise, revenue climbed 21% to $8.4 billion.Microsoft doesn\u2019t disclose revenue figures for its Azure and Office 365 businesses, but it said Azure revenue jumped 97% and Office 365 revenue rose 43%.\u201cAzure was the primary source of our outperformance in the quarter,\u201d Microsoft finance chief       Amy Hood       said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s higher than I was expecting.\u201dOverall, Microsoft posted $6.51 billion in fourth-quarter net income, or 83 cents a share, compared with a profit of $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding the impact of revenue deferrals and other items, adjusted earnings climbed to 98 cents from 69 cents a year earlier. Per-share earnings in the most recent quarter included a 23-cent tax benefit related to Microsoft winding down its mobile-phone business.Revenue rose 13% to $23.32 billion and was $24.7 billion when adjusted to reflect Windows 10 revenue deferrals.Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected Microsoft to report adjusted per-share earnings of 71 cents, a figure that didn\u2019t include the 23-cent tax benefit, on $24.29 billion in adjusted revenue.Shares rose 3.1% to $76.50 in after-hours trading after results beat expectations. The software giant\u2019s shares closed at a record on Thursday, after setting its previous high a day earlier.Microsoft\u2019s growth in the so-called hyperscale public cloud market was faster in the quarter than investors anticipated. The cloud unit is still smaller than Amazon in the market but appears to be pulling away from its nearest rival, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst       Brad Reback.\u201cThey are the undisputed No. 2 in the hyperscale public cloud market, and it will be extraordinarily difficult for anyone to catch them,\u201d Mr. Reback said.Two years ago, Microsoft forecast its commercial-cloud run-rate\u2014the last month of sales of its Azure and Office 365 products, multiplied by 12\u2014would top $20 billion in the 2018 fiscal year that began July 1. At the end of the fourth quarter, the run-rate stood at $18.9 billion.\u201cObviously, we\u2019re feeling pretty confident about hitting\u201d the target, Ms. Hood said.The strides Microsoft has made in the cloud come as its legacy Windows operating-system business shrinks. Revenue in its More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows as well as the mobile-phone and gaming businesses, slid 2% to $8.8 billion. Last week, International Data Corp. reported world-wide PC shipments fell 3.3% in the second quarter, while             Gartner Inc.       estimated the drop at 4.3%.Revenue for Microsoft\u2019s Surface line of computers also fell 2%. Three months ago, that business was hit hard, registering a 26% revenue decline, which the company attributed to older Surface computers in the market, as well as increased price competition.Since then, Microsoft has introduced a new Surface laptop for the education market and an update to its Surface Pro tablet-laptop hybrid device, though those products made their debut with just a few weeks left in the quarter.LinkedIn Corp., the professional social network Microsoft acquired last December for $27 billion, added $1.07 billion in revenue and posted a $361 million operating loss. Microsoft is working to connect its business products to LinkedIn, giving sales representatives using its Dynamics software, for example, tools to easily mine the professional social network to prospect for leads.Like its cloud rivals Amazon and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Microsoft is spending lavishly to build giant and expensive data centers around the world to deliver its cloud services. In the quarter, Microsoft spent $3.3 billion on capital expenses, with much of that money going toward its data center expansion. A year ago, Microsoft had $3.1 billion in capital expenses.In the current quarter, Microsoft expects revenue in its Intelligent Cloud business of between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion, up from $6.38 billion a year earlier. Revenue in its Productivity and Business Processes segment should land between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion, including about $1.1 billion from LinkedIn. A year earlier, that segment posted $6.66 billion. Microsoft said the More Personal Computing segment\u2019s revenue will be between $8.6 billion and $8.9 billion, compared with $9.29 billion a year ago.Write to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Microsoft Forges Ahead In Cloud.'", "news_title": "Microsoft Profit Jumps, Fueled by Cloud Computing"}, {"keywords": "tech bubble,tech stocks,wall street journal streetwise,Amazon.com,AMZN,Alphabet,GOOG,Facebook,FB,Microsoft,MSFT,Zillow Group,Z,Tesla,TSLA,Tim Edwards,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,routine market,financial news,retail,wholesale,etailing,internet search engines,e-commerce,online service providers,technology", "news_time": "2017-07-20 14:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-is-no-bubble-but-the-stock-market-might-be-1500572064", "content": "U.S. technology stocks have finally passed their 17-year-old bubble-era high, and the speed of this year\u2019s rally has many\u2014including me\u2014concerned. The S&P 500\u2019s information-technology sector is up 23%. Of the 10 stocks adding the most market value, eight are tech stocks, when             Amazon.com        AMZN 0.18%       is included. Those who missed out surely regret it.But take a step back, and a lot of the gains look more like catch-up than bubble. There might be an everything bubble, but neither tech stocks nor mega-capitalization companies stand out as particularly frothy when looking at performance.In the past froth was obvious. In the dot-com bubble of 2000 the tech sector produced clearly unsustainable returns\u2014annualized at 53% including dividends for five years\u2014that were miles ahead of everything else. In the \u201cpeak oil\u201d bubble of 2008 the energy sector had similarly unrealistic five-year annualized gains of 31%.There\u2019s been nothing like this in recent years. It\u2019s true that tech stocks have been wonderful for investors this year, particularly the big names of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple,             Facebook                   and             Microsoft.       But they were mostly just catching up with underperformance in the aftermath of the election, when Silicon Valley was obviously out of favor with the new president, and hopes of tax cuts boosted companies that actually pay U.S. tax.Look instead at one-year or five-year performance and the tech sector is in line with the financial sector. Or go all the way back to the stock market low of March 2009: Since then financials and tech stock prices have both risen a bit more than 390%, as bank failure risk was priced out; including dividends, real estate, financials and consumer discretionary stocks are all ahead of tech over the period.It\u2019s true that some tech stocks are in other sectors, distorting the measure. Amazon is classed as retail, and its stellar performance generated about a fifth of the consumer discretionary sector\u2019s gains since the 2009 low\u2014and half this year\u2019s gains. But the financial sector rally has been about traditional banking and insurance\u2014not fintech, while real estate is as offline as a stock can be.Another way to judge excessive enthusiasm for disruptive companies should be to look at the losers. Old-style retail stocks, owners of U.S. malls and more recently stocks such as Zillow facing rumors of competition from Amazon have all been hammered.Have they been driven down too far? Taking the gap between the best and worst performing sectors offers a measure of how powerful investment fashions are, and it is wider than usual at the moment. Yet, it doesn\u2019t back up the disruption theory.Over the past year the best sector has outperformed the worst by more than 50 percentage points, the second-widest gap since the recovery from the crisis in 2009. In the 2000 bubble the gap reached 124 points, and in 2008 energy was 66 percentage points ahead of the worst sector (real estate, where the property-price crash was already under way).Yet, if this wide gap between the best and worst sectors is a reason to worry, it isn\u2019t a reason to worry about tech, since financials edged it as the best-performing over the past year, just. The worst performers were telecom, disrupted by an old-fashioned price war, and energy, disrupted by OPEC and shale.Perhaps enthusiasm for disruption doesn\u2019t show up between sectors, though. Amazon is disrupting retail, and new technologies are being deployed in many other sectors too. If investors were betting on the disrupters and against the disrupted, we should expect to see a big gap between the best and worst performers within sectors. We don\u2019t.Tim Edwards at S&P Dow Jones Indices calculates a measure known as dispersion showing how much variation there is in stock performance. Only in the industrial and financial sectors is it higher than the long-run average, and even within consumer discretionary the effect of Amazon isn\u2019t visible, with dispersion slightly below average.I think investors give Amazon and Tesla way too much credit as disrupters, but being overpriced isn\u2019t the same thing as being in a bubble. There could be an everything bubble lifting the entire market, but stock performance doesn\u2019t suggest over-enthusiastic investors have inflated a tech bubble or even a broader bubble of disrupters.

Investors dumped shares of big appliance sellers that have been benefiting from Sears\u2019s retreat. Lowe\u2019s Cos. tumbled;             Home Depot Inc.

BBY -3.93%       fell 4% apiece.Amazon\u2019s rapid growth has displaced traditional stores and left even powerful brands unable to ignore it.             Nike Inc.,       one of the biggest holdouts, recently decided to start selling directly to Amazon.For Sears, selling Kenmore outside its own stores or websites could give it a boost in sales, which have declined every year since 2007. \u201cThis will give the Kenmore brand access to a new set of customers who aren\u2019t necessarily shopping at Sears,\u201d said Dev Mukherjee, a former president of Sears home appliances, who now works at a private-equity firm.But also it gives shoppers one less reason to visit a Sears department store. \u201cWe believe most Amazon sales will simply cannibalize Sears stores,\u201d said Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba, since other major retailers don\u2019t currently sell Kenmore.Sears\u2019s long-battered shares jumped 11% to $9.60, while Amazon, based in Seattle, closed at an all-time high of $1,028.70. Amazon\u2019s market value is closing in on $500 billion, Sears\u2019s hovers near $1 billion.Kenmore is Amazon\u2019s first retail offering in major appliances. Previously, most major appliances available on Amazon were via third-party sellers on its marketplace.\u201cAmazon is a continual improvement machine, and Kenmore is a brand with extraordinary heritage and awareness,\u201d something that could transform it into a major winner in an online category currently lacking a dominant player, said Ken Seiff, a venture capitalist at Beanstalk Ventures and a former retail executive. \u201cThere\u2019s no positive outcome\u201d for brick-and-mortar competitors.While major appliances are a fraction of Home Depot and Best Buy\u2019s sales, Amazon is now increasingly targeting their bread-and-butter business of services, says Forrester Research analyst Brendan Witcher. \u201cFor years we believed the defensible margins were those in services, because it\u2019s not easy to do online,\u201d he said. But as Amazon\u2019s artificial intelligence assistant Alexa is installed in more devices\u2014including Kenmore\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s changing.A Home Depot spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with our competitive positioning from both a brand and service perspective.\u201d Best Buy declined to comment.Amazon, which started selling books online more than two decades ago, is now gaining ground in a number of categories, from office supplies to home goods. After a serious push into apparel a decade ago, it is now one of the biggest clothing retailers, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey, second only to             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.More than half of product searches now start at Amazon, according to personalization platform company BloomReach, versus 28% on search engines and even fewer at other retail sites. The company\u2019s Prime subscription program, which according to UBS has an estimated 63 million North American members, also offers companies broad access to customers.Amazon has bigger ambitions than selling Kenmore products. The company plans to expand its reach in both furniture and appliances, according to people familiar with the matter. It is also building at least four massive warehouses focused on handling bulky items, the people said.Under the Kenmore deal, Amazon will own the inventory but Sears will ship orders from its warehouses, a Sears spokesman said. Innovel Solutions, a unit of Sears, will deliver the goods to customers\u2019 homes and provide installation services, he said. The companies didn\u2019t disclose the terms of the deal.\u201cWe\u2019re constantly working to expand our selection,\u201d said Matt Furlong, general manager of home improvement and appliances at Amazon.The Kenmore name first appeared in 1913 on a sewing machine. The first Kenmore washing machine was introduced in 1927 and business boomed after World War II. And for years, the only place Americans could buy a Kenmore stove or washing machine was at their local Sears or Kmart.But there are fewer of those sprawling stores these days\u2014nearly 1,000 have closed since 2009\u2014and people aren\u2019t buying as much from them.The brand is now produced by Whirlpool Corp.,             Electrolux                   AB and other manufacturers.Sears\u2019s share of major-appliance sales in the U.S. fell to 22% in the 12 months ended March, down from 30% four years earlier, according to TraQline, a market research firm. In addition to Kenmore, Sears sells other brands. The Kenmore brand\u2019s share of the market fell to 10.3% from 16.7% during that same period.Sears CEO       Eddie Lampert,        a hedge-fund manager who took control of Kmart out of bankruptcy and merged it with Sears in 2005, had been looking at strategic options for the company\u2019s top brands for more than a year, as the parent company\u2019s losses have mounted.Earlier this year, he agreed to sell the Craftsman tool brand to             Stanley Black & Decker Inc.       for $900 million, helping to pay down debt and pension costs. Sears is still exploring options for its DieHard brand, Sears Auto Centers and its Home Services unit.\u201cThe launch of Kenmore on             Amazon.com        AMZN 0.18%       will NOT significantly boost Sears\u2019s liquidity,\u201d wrote Bill Dreher, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group in a note to clients. \u201cWe suspect this is a move to beautify the Kenmore brand for divestiture and help alleviate some pressure, temporarily, of Sears as a going concern.\u201dMr. Lampert, who owns more than half of Sears\u2019s shares and is a large creditor, wrote in a blog post Thursday that the Amazon deal \u201cis a testament to our commitment to unlocking value from our various assets.\u201dThe CEO has also been cutting spending and selling real estate to help the company fund its operations. He has also been financing the company, including a $200 million short-term credit line that Sears announced Monday.Although that line was marketed to others, only entities affiliated with Mr. Lampert participated in the financing, according to one investor. The Sears spokesman said the company is in ongoing discussions with various parties with respect to the loan facility.\u2014Andrew Scurria and Imani Morse contributed to this article.Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Sears Links With Amazon, Jolting Appliance Industry.'", "news_title": "Sears to Sell Kenmore Brand on Amazon"}, {"keywords": "arizona,cancer,congress,congressional republicans,john mccain,mccain,republicans,senate,senate republicans,trump,McCain,John McCain,political,general news,health,medical conditions,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions", "news_time": "2017-07-20 11:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mccain-health-news-stuns-capital-heres-why-1500564466", "content": "At one point in his remarkable run through the New Hampshire Republican primary in 2000, Sen. John       McCain       went into full maverick mode to describe his quest to upset his party\u2019s prohibitive favorite in the race.\u201c      George Bush       is out there raising money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out there raising hell.\u201dRaising hell is what       John McCain       has always been willing to do, without much regard for party or precedent. Indeed, it often appears he can\u2019t help himself. It\u2019s a style that occasionally infuriates Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014but that ultimately has endeared him to many people in both parties, who admire his life story and the courage that has been laced through its many chapters.That admiration explains why the capital went into a kind of shock Wednesday night when the news broke that Mr. McCain has been diagnosed with a brain tumor.At one Washington dinner, perhaps a dozen cellphones pinged more or less simultaneously with the news, which temporarily brought the proceedings to a halt. Sen.       Lindsey Graham,        his closest friend in the Senate, articulated the view of many when he said that cancer has now picked the toughest opponent possible. And as if to underscore the point, Mr. McCain tweeted Thursday his intention to return to the Senate quickly.In a capital full of diverse characters, John McCain stands out. He is singular. Part of it is his remarkable story as a Vietnam War veteran: A young and somewhat reckless Navy pilot shot down over North Vietnam, grievously injured and then imprisoned under the most horrific conditions for more than five years, during which he declined opportunities to be released before his comrades. Candidate       Donald Trump       said during the 2016 campaign that Mr. McCain wasn\u2019t a war hero, but few agreed.There has followed a political career that took him first to the House and then to the Senate and ultimately to the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.But it was that iconic 2000 presidential campaign that cemented the Arizonan\u2019s reputation as a unique political figure.To anyone who wasn\u2019t there, it\u2019s almost impossible to describe what it was like. He banked his whole campaign on winning the New Hampshire primary, and set out to do so by canvassing the state, day after day, on a bus filled with aides and reporters and straight talk. In fact, it became known as the \u201cStraight Talk Express,\u201d and his dozens of town-hall meetings were a cross between religious revivals and voter-therapy sessions.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.He slaughtered his party\u2019s sacred cows and picked up support from disgruntled voters along the way. He said the GOP\u2019s big-money donors not only owned Mr. Bush, but were destroying democracy in the process. He said an emerging federal budget surplus should be used not for tax cuts, but to pay down debt and bank money for Social Security. He attacked the religious right, directly and repeatedly. He was light on policy details, but details didn\u2019t seem to be the point.He became a kind of Pied Piper in New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t just reporters who followed him around. Voters did, too; some of them trailing him in their cars from one town hall to another just to be part of it.In the end, he did win New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t enough, because he went on to lose to Mr. Bush in South Carolina and ultimately in the race for the nomination. He finally won the elusive nomination eight years later, but it felt as if he\u2019d never quite recaptured that 2000 lightning.He returned to the Senate after the 2008 loss to Barack Obama, and seemed deflated at first. But then he roared back, and now leads the powerful Armed Services Committee and occupies a prominent place in every debate and controversy. Among other things, as a victim of torture himself, he has emerged as a powerful voice against harsh interrogation techniques.Sen. McCain has occasionally struck colleagues as tired and disoriented in recent days, probably early signs of the cancer diagnosis to come. But when he appeared last month at a Wall Street Journal conference for an onstage interview, he was sharp as ever.And as outspoken as ever. He talked of his disappointment that President Donald Trump didn\u2019t raise human rights concerns on his recent trip to the Middle East: \u201cIf we abandon our advocacy for human rights, we\u2019re no different than any other nation that rises and falls throughout history,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t change human beings,\u201d Sen. McCain added. \u201cThey want freedom. They want human rights, and they look to us as the role model and our inspiration.\u201dWrite to Gerald F.

Amtrak\u2019s Acela Express travels between New York and Washington in slightly less than three hours.He didn\u2019t immediately say which government agency or official had given approval, or elaborate on issues such as timing or cost, but later added he aimed to build similar systems in suburban Los Angeles and Texas. Infrastructure projects of large sizes often take years\u2014if not decades\u2014to receive government approvals.\u201cStill a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote.A representative for Mr. Musk\u2019s tunnel venture, The Boring Company, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for clarification.The Transportation Department referred questions about the hyperloop to the White House, which confirmed conversations with Mr. Musk and other Boring Company executives. But the White House didn\u2019t say whether it had given any kind of approval for the hyperloop.A White House spokesman said in a statement: \u201cWe have had promising conversations to date, are committed to transformative infrastructure projects, and believe our greatest solutions have often come from the ingenuity and drive of the private sector.\u201dA spokesman for New York\u2019s mayor tweeted the announcement was \u201cnews to City Hall.\u201dMr. Musk\u2019s tweets raised more questions than they answered.Depending on the route, such a project could require approvals from five or six state governments, said Lynne Kiesling, associate director of Purdue University\u2019s Research Center in Economics. Ms. Kiesling\u2019s research includes the effect of regulatory institutions on technological change.\u201cStringing together five or six such approvals would be a long, costly and fractious process,\u201d she said.Mr. Musk has long talked about the creation of a so-called hyperloop, a system for high-speed transportation in a near-vacuum state that takes place in miles-long tubes. Since Mr. Musk floated the idea in 2013, others have tried to commercialize the concept. Hyperloop One has raised $180 million but has faced delays in rolling out a prototype.Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets convey his wide-ranging interests. He is chief executive of electric-car maker             Tesla Inc.,       which last year merged with energy company SolarCity, another business he backed. He also heads rocket-maker Space Exploration Technologies Corp.In April, Mr. Musk announced plans for a new company called Neuralink Corp., where he also is CEO, aiming to merge computers with brains so humans could one day engage in \u201cconsensual telepathy.\u201dIn his series of tweets Thursday, Mr. Musk said the hyperloop system, a network linking New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, would be accessible from city centers, with up to a dozen access points in each city.Mr. Musk responded to few of the questions posed to him on Twitter. \u201cSupport would be much appreciated!\u201d he said in one tweet.He began teasing the idea of a tunnel project on Twitter in December, with a post saying, \u201cTraffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear, however, if the musing was more than just a man bored with Los Angeles traffic.In January he tweeted: \u201cExciting progress on the tunnel front.\u201d \u201cPlan to start digging in a month or so,\u201d he said.He has been testing his tunneling techniques at SpaceX in Hawthorne, Calif.Just days ago, at a gathering of U.S. governors, Mr. Musk answered a question about whether he feels pressure from people\u2019s expectations about his projects, particularly in light of the Tesla\u2019s stock price, which has soared more than 50% this year.\u201cI find it quite tough when there are very high expectations,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cI try to actually tamp down those expectations.\u201d\u2014Eliot Brown contributed to this article.Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "news_title": "Elon Musk Teases a New York-to-D.C.
