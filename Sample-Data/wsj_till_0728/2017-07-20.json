[{"news_time": "2017-07-20 23:43:00", "news_title": "Regulators Drop Pursuit of Banker, CEO Pay Restrictions", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Several regulators have dropped pursuit of a long-running plan to restrict bonuses on Wall Street, as part of a wider effort to stop working on unfinished rules put in place after the financial crisis.Government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and several banking regulators, were directed under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to develop compensation rules intended to curb excessive risk taking. Former President       Barack Obama,        during his last year in office, personally urged regulators to finish the rules before his term ended.The six agencies delivered a new proposal in April 2016, but that was too late to push through a final version of the rule before President Donald Trump took office in January.New regulatory agendas unveiled Thursday by the SEC and others show leaders excluded any mention of the restrictions, including longer deferment periods for bonuses and the amount of time payouts are subject to potential clawbacks. The proposal had targeted executives at some of the nation\u2019s largest financial firms, including investment managers and mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but the stiffest rules were reserved for big banks.The shift, disclosed in a semiannual list of pending regulations federal agencies provide to the White House\u2019s budget office, discloses how regulators in the Trump administration have started pulling back from postfinancial crisis rules. New SEC Chairman       Jay Clayton       has outlined a more business-friendly agenda, including promoting more ways for companies to raise capital in public markets.\u201cWe\u2019ve moved beyond commissioners and staff who were deeply involved in trying to fix things after the crisis,\u201d said Tyler Gellasch, a former Democratic Senate aide who is now executive director of Healthy Markets Association, a group of mutual-fund managers and pension funds. \u201cThe priorities are more commensurate with where the economy and financial system is today.\u201dRules requiring compromise among multiple regulators have proved to be heavy lifts. Agencies first proposed the incentive-compensation regulation in 2011, but questions about which employees should be covered and how to apply the restrictions to firms with different business models bogged down further progress.It isn\u2019t clear what consequences agencies would face if they abandon the proposal. Republican lawmakers, who control both houses of Congress and opposed Dodd-Frank, won\u2019t force action. Some advocacy groups that backed Dodd-Frank have sued the SEC to finish rules, including one that required oil and gas companies to report payments they make to governments for mining rights.\u201cIts pretty outrageous that independent financial regulatory agencies appear to be thumbing their nose at Congress and statutory mandates,\u201d said Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the liberal Center for American Progress.The agencies\u2019 leaders also could defend their inaction by citing other regulatory priorities and noting they could revive measures not included on the agendas outlined Thursday.\u201cThe agenda gives you a sense of where the agency is going to focus its resources, but it is not dispositive about what it ultimately will or will not do,\u201d said James Burns, a former senior SEC official who is now a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.The SEC\u2019s updated agenda was crafted in the spring, when an acting executive,       Michael Piwowar,        ran the commission. Mr. Piwowar, who is back to serving as an SEC commissioner, said earlier this year that he wouldn\u2019t prioritize Dodd-Frank rules. Mr. Clayton took office in May, so the agenda could further change in the fall when he issues an update.Government efforts to restrict traders\u2019 and bankers\u2019 bonuses prompted a lobbying counteroffensive by Wall Street. Financial regulators in turn have struggled for years to craft the joint rule, which Democrats in Congress intended to restrain risk taking at big banks and brokerage firms.The proposal was excluded from the SEC\u2019s agenda as well as lists disclosed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. However, the Federal Reserve maintained the proposal on its agenda.An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the extent to which the commission has stopped working on the congressionally mandated rules. The Federal Reserve declined to comment.The restrictions would have required the biggest financial firms to defer payment of at least half of executives\u2019 bonuses for four years, a year longer than what is common industry practice.The plan also would require a minimum of seven years for the biggest firms to claw back bonuses if it turns out an executive\u2019s decisions hurt the institution or if a firm has to restate financial results.Wall Street bonuses have come down significantly since the financial crisis, when record payouts against the backdrop of a worsening economy and bailed out banks heaped public and political scorn on the financial sector.The average Wall Street bonus rose 1% in 2016 to $138,210, according to a March estimate from New York state Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli.That is 28% lower than the peak hit in 2006.The newly released SEC agenda also dropped mention of a rule that would require public companies to disclose a standardized metric comparing executive pay with stock performance.It also omits any mention of other unfinished Dodd-Frank rules that govern trading of swaps, a type of contract that allows investors to bet on asset prices without owning the underlying stock or bond. The global swaps market is dominated by large banks such as             Goldman Sachs Group                   Inc. and             Citigroup                   Inc.The SEC\u2019s oversight of swaps is limited to products such as credit-default swaps\u2014insurance-like contracts that pay out when a country or company defaults on debt\u2014which constitute a small percentage of the total market. The broader swaps market is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has largely implemented its trading rules. The SEC has advanced portions of its rules over the years but hasn\u2019t finished the whole package.The list also dropped two measures that began under former SEC Chairman       Mary Jo White,        who was appointed by Mr. Obama. One rule would make it easier for shareholders to vote on board candidates nominated by investors, as opposed to the slate backed by the company. Another would have required companies to disclose more about the racial and gender diversity of corporate boards. Ms. White urged businesses to do more to recruit women and minorities to their boards, saying the \u201clow level of board diversity in the United States is unacceptable.\u201d\u2014Rachel Witkowski contributed to this article.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Regulators Retrench on Pay Rules.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-drop-pursuit-of-banker-ceo-pay-restrictions-1500590543", "keywords": ["agenda,ceo pay,dodd-frank,donald trump,executive pay,finreg,sec,sec chairman jay clayton,wall street,Securities and Exchange Commission,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Citigroup,C,Jay Clayton,regulation,government policy,management,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 22:33:00", "news_title": "Ole Miss Football Coach Resigns Amid Probe Into Phone Calls ", "content": "Hugh Freeze,        who led a revival in Ole Miss football but whose program faced a barrage of accusations from the NCAA, resigned Thursday in a surprise move tied to an investigation into his phone records.The school \u201cdiscovered a pattern of conduct that is not consistent with our expectations,\u201d University of Mississippi athletic director Ross Bjork said at a press conference Thursday evening.Several media outlets reported Thursday that they had asked Freeze in recent days about a call to an escort service from his university-issued phone. Freeze had denied making the call, those reports said.Bjork said the call was brought to the school\u2019s attention last week and, because it lasted for less than a minute, was attributed to a misdial. But a deeper investigation by the school revealed a \u201cconcerning pattern,\u201d Bjork said. He later added that if Freeze hadn\u2019t resigned, he would have been fired.\u201cWe simply cannot accept the conduct in his personal life that we have discovered,\u201d Ole Miss Chancellor       Jeffrey Vitter       said.Bjork said Freeze admitted to the behavior. \u201cHe has taken the responsibility and is accountable for his actions,\u201d Bjork said.Freeze didn\u2019t release a statement and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Freeze\u2019s tenure in Oxford, Miss., was troubled in recent years by questions of impropriety that included accusations by the NCAA of academic and recruiting violations. The school had already issued a self-imposed bowl ban for this season.Another ugly turn came in a lawsuit this month filed by the school\u2019s previous coach,       Houston Nutt,        alleging that Ole Miss tried to create the perception that the issue with the NCAA was his fault. Nutt\u2019s attorney first notified Ole Miss about the phone calls that led to Freeze\u2019s resignation, according to multiple media reports.\u201cFacing adversity is something that we\u2019re familiar with,\u201d Freeze said a week ago. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of been around us for a while now, and I sure will be glad for the day to when I can stand here and it\u2019s not.\u201dStill, there was a reason Rebel fans were willing to hold their noses for so long: His teams did what mattered most in SEC country.

Now Uncle Sam is going to get paid.Steven Cohen       is one of many managers preparing to write huge checks in early 2018 due to a crisis-era decision to close a tax loophole that long benefited some of Wall Street\u2019s wealthiest investors.The billionaire founder of SAC Capital Advisors LP amassed deferred offshore income of more than $1 billion likely subject to the taxation, said people familiar with the matter. Other hedge-fund managers facing personal tax bills of over $100 million include       David Einhorn       of Greenlight Capital Inc. and       Daniel Loeb       of Third Point LLC, said people familiar with the matter.Total payments from all managers could amount to $25 billion, according to\u00a0a 2008\u00a0estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation. Some tax specialists say the bill could be even higher: $100 billion or more.The 2008 tax change affects federal, state and local taxes. This will likely mean a surge of tax revenue for Connecticut, historically the center of the hedge-fund industry. The state isn\u2019t yet sure how much it will reap, a spokesman for the governor\u2019s budget office said.\u201cAny projection would be too speculative to be reliable,\u201d the spokesman said.Hedge-fund\u00a0managers\u00a0are considering several steps to raise cash or soften the tax blow. Some\u00a0will trim stakes in their funds to raise cash, said       Brett Barth       of hedge-fund investor BBR Partners LLC.Hedge funds often invest\u00a0through\u00a0vehicles\u00a0based inside and outside the U.S. They make money from their cut, typically 20% or more of trading profits.For decades, the Internal Revenue Service allowed managers of offshore funds to defer receipt of this compensation and both avoid an immediate tax bill and grow the savings tax-free. The IRS generally permits businesses to allow executives to defer compensation because such deferrals lower the firms\u2019 compensation costs, forcing them to pay higher taxes on profits. That offsets income taxes not immediately paid by employees.But this practice cost the Treasury income in the case of offshore hedge funds that don\u2019t pay any offsetting U.S. taxes.Managers\u00a0in some cases let those deferred trading fees compound\u00a0tax-free\u00a0for 10 years or longer.\u00a0Some also deferred management fees, even as\u00a0they amassed large fortunes from gains earned by their U.S.-based funds.\u201cThey kept rolling and rolling the money,\u201d said       Richard Zarin,        a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP.The             New York Times                   in 2007 highlighted this loophole, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to close it the following year as a way of raising revenue and stabilizing the financial sector during the 2008 financial crisis. The change, part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of October 2008, was made in section 457A of the IRS code.The legislation gave managers a decade to pay taxes on money accumulated before the law changed. That deadline is now nine months away.The deferred fees\u00a0will be taxed at ordinary tax rates that can be close to 50% depending on where the managers live and work,\u00a0according to tax experts.\u201cThese are smart, aggressive people who don\u2019t want to pay more than they have to, and writing a huge check can be quite demoralizing,\" said\u00a0      Jonathan Brenner,        a tax partner\u00a0at Caplin & Drysdale, a law firm that specializes in tax law. \u201cMost recognize they\u2019ve had a good run and now have to pay the piper, though not after first asking six different ways if there\u2019s some silver bullet\u201d to eliminate or reduce the taxes.Mr. Cohen, who ran SAC Capital before it pleaded guilty to criminal insider-trading charges in 2013, is nearing a launch of a new firm to manage as much as $20 billion, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Mr. Cohen settled a related civil case without admitting or denying wrongdoing.He has set that $20 billion target, which would exceed the $16 billion managed at peak by SAC, partly because he wants to generate income to help pay the large tax bill, a person close to him said.Other\u00a0fund managers\u00a0are shifting headquarters to Florida to mitigate the tax impact, said a local official. Florida doesn\u2019t have a state income tax\u00a0on personal income.\u201cEven four or five years ago they saw this coming, they knew they\u2019d bring money back in and needed to be in a state with lower taxes,\u201d said       Kelly Smallridge,        president of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County.Those moves are no guarantee of a smaller tax\u00a0bite\u00a0because states\u00a0generally examine where and when deferred compensation was earned, experts say.\u201cPeople have been banging on our doors since the provision was enacted looking for a solution and we still have clients coming in, but one hasn\u2019t been found,\u201d\u00a0said Mr. Brenner. \u201cEvery tax lawyer who touches hedge funds has had these kinds of calls\u2026.There\u2019s\u00a0frustration among some clients that a solution has not been found.\u201dSome charities\u00a0say\u00a0managers anticipating a tax bite\u00a0are discussing donations\u2014to receive an immediate tax deduction\u2014rather than handing money to\u00a0the government.Other\u00a0managers are turning to charitable lead annuity trusts, said       Henry Bregstein,        an attorney at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP. These trusts give a donor an upfront deduction of 100% as well as the opportunity to transfer to heirs,\u00a0free of gift and estate tax,\u00a0the trust\u2019s remaining value at the term\u2019s end after making annual, fixed distributions to charities.Eileen Heisman,        chief executive officer of National Philanthropic Trust, said her organization is speaking to roughly 50 fund managers about establishing donor-advised funds by the end of the year, three times the usual pace. She attributes the increase to the looming tax bills. Such funds make grants to charities on behalf of donors after they contribute assets, enabling immediate tax deductions. Assets can be invested and grow tax-free even before the charities are chosen.Sometimes this money can be invested in the manager\u2019s own funds, with restrictions, Ms. Heisman said. There\u2019s no way of knowing how much money will be paid in taxes or how much will be shifted to charitable groups, she said. \u201cBut we think it will be very large.\u201dWrite to Gregory Zuckerman at gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com and Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Big Tax Bills Loom For Fund Managers.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/loophole-closed-hedge-fund-managers-prepare-huge-tax-checks-1500543002", "keywords": ["Greenlight Capital,SAC Capital Advisors,Third Point,David Einhorn,Steven Cohen,Brett Barth,Eileen Heisman,Jonathan Brenner,Richard Zarin,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,investment banking,alternative investments,credit,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 22:04:00", "news_title": "Corrections & Amplifications", "content": "Dalian Wanda Group on July 10 announced a deal to sell 76 of its 102 hotels to             Sunac China Holdings Ltd.

SHLD -0.57%       said Thursday it will start selling its Kenmore appliances on Amazon, loosening its grip on one of its historic product lines and becoming the latest big American brand to capitulate to the online-retail giant.News of Amazon\u2019s move into appliances, one of the categories it hasn\u2019t deeply penetrated, rippled through the industry. Investors dumped shares of big appliance sellers that have been benefiting from Sears\u2019s retreat. Lowe\u2019s Cos. tumbled;             Home Depot Inc.        HD -0.19%       and             Best Buy Co.        BBY 0.45%       fell 4% apiece.Amazon\u2019s rapid growth has displaced traditional stores and left even powerful brands unable to ignore it.             Nike Inc.,       one of the biggest holdouts, recently decided to start selling directly to Amazon.For Sears, selling Kenmore outside its own stores or websites could give it a boost in sales, which have declined every year since 2007. \u201cThis will give the Kenmore brand access to a new set of customers who aren\u2019t necessarily shopping at Sears,\u201d said Dev Mukherjee, a former president of Sears home appliances, who now works at a private-equity firm.But also it gives shoppers one less reason to visit a Sears department store. \u201cWe believe most Amazon sales will simply cannibalize Sears stores,\u201d said Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba, since other major retailers don\u2019t currently sell Kenmore.Sears\u2019s long-battered shares jumped 11% to $9.60, while Amazon, based in Seattle, closed at an all-time high of $1,028.70. Amazon\u2019s market value is closing in on $500 billion, Sears\u2019s hovers near $1 billion.Kenmore is Amazon\u2019s first retail offering in major appliances. Previously, most major appliances available on Amazon were via third-party sellers on its marketplace.\u201cAmazon is a continual improvement machine, and Kenmore is a brand with extraordinary heritage and awareness,\u201d something that could transform it into a major winner in an online category currently lacking a dominant player, said Ken Seiff, a venture capitalist at Beanstalk Ventures and a former retail executive. \u201cThere\u2019s no positive outcome\u201d for brick-and-mortar competitors.While major appliances are a fraction of Home Depot and Best Buy\u2019s sales, Amazon is now increasingly targeting their bread-and-butter business of services, says Forrester Research analyst Brendan Witcher. \u201cFor years we believed the defensible margins were those in services, because it\u2019s not easy to do online,\u201d he said. But as Amazon\u2019s artificial intelligence assistant Alexa is installed in more devices\u2014including Kenmore\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s changing.A Home Depot spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with our competitive positioning from both a brand and service perspective.\u201d Best Buy declined to comment.Amazon, which started selling books online more than two decades ago, is now gaining ground in a number of categories, from office supplies to home goods. After a serious push into apparel a decade ago, it is now one of the biggest clothing retailers, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey, second only to             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.More than half of product searches now start at Amazon, according to personalization platform company BloomReach, versus 28% on search engines and even fewer at other retail sites. The company\u2019s Prime subscription program, which according to UBS has an estimated 63 million North American members, also offers companies broad access to customers.Amazon has bigger ambitions than selling Kenmore products. The company plans to expand its reach in both furniture and appliances, according to people familiar with the matter. It is also building at least four massive warehouses focused on handling bulky items, the people said.Under the Kenmore deal, Amazon will own the inventory but Sears will ship orders from its warehouses, a Sears spokesman said. Innovel Solutions, a unit of Sears, will deliver the goods to customers\u2019 homes and provide installation services, he said. The companies didn\u2019t disclose the terms of the deal.\u201cWe\u2019re constantly working to expand our selection,\u201d said Matt Furlong, general manager of home improvement and appliances at Amazon.The Kenmore name first appeared in 1913 on a sewing machine. The first Kenmore washing machine was introduced in 1927 and business boomed after World War II. And for years, the only place Americans could buy a Kenmore stove or washing machine was at their local Sears or Kmart.But there are fewer of those sprawling stores these days\u2014nearly 1,000 have closed since 2009\u2014and people aren\u2019t buying as much from them.The brand is now produced by Whirlpool Corp.,             Electrolux                   AB and other manufacturers.Sears\u2019s share of major-appliance sales in the U.S. fell to 22% in the 12 months ended March, down from 30% four years earlier, according to TraQline, a market research firm. In addition to Kenmore, Sears sells other brands. The Kenmore brand\u2019s share of the market fell to 10.3% from 16.7% during that same period.Sears CEO       Eddie Lampert,        a hedge-fund manager who took control of Kmart out of bankruptcy and merged it with Sears in 2005, had been looking at strategic options for the company\u2019s top brands for more than a year, as the parent company\u2019s losses have mounted.Earlier this year, he agreed to sell the Craftsman tool brand to             Stanley Black & Decker Inc.       for $900 million, helping to pay down debt and pension costs. Sears is still exploring options for its DieHard brand, Sears Auto Centers and its Home Services unit.\u201cThe launch of Kenmore on             Amazon.com        AMZN 1.24%       will NOT significantly boost Sears\u2019s liquidity,\u201d wrote Bill Dreher, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group in a note to clients. \u201cWe suspect this is a move to beautify the Kenmore brand for divestiture and help alleviate some pressure, temporarily, of Sears as a going concern.\u201dMr. Lampert, who owns more than half of Sears\u2019s shares and is a large creditor, wrote in a blog post Thursday that the Amazon deal \u201cis a testament to our commitment to unlocking value from our various assets.\u201dThe CEO has also been cutting spending and selling real estate to help the company fund its operations. He has also been financing the company, including a $200 million short-term credit line that Sears announced Monday.Although that line was marketed to others, only entities affiliated with Mr. Lampert participated in the financing, according to one investor.

Grassley Says He Will Press Witnesses to Appear at Senate Hearing", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee said he would issue subpoenas if witnesses refuse to appear at a Senate hearing next week that will largely focus on a June 2016 meeting between the president\u2019s son, top       Trump       campaign advisers and a group of Russian advocates.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said that he will compel witnesses to appear at a hearing scheduled for July 26 on the topic of foreign lobbying. Mr. Grassley has summoned Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for several months in 2016, and Donald Trump Jr. to next week\u2019s hearing, along with sanctions activist and businessman Bill Browder and opposition researcher Glenn Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who now runs a political intelligence firm in Washington called Fusion GPS.\u201cI indicated to them that there will be a subpoena if they don\u2019t come,\u201d Mr. Grassley told reporters Thursday. He said that he hoped the witnesses would cooperate voluntarily but that he and ranking Democrat Sen.       Dianne Feinstein       (D., Calif.) are willing to jointly issue subpoenas.The committee is one of several congressional panels investigating a consensus from the U.S. intelligence community that Russia interfered in last year\u2019s presidential election and allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow\u2019s efforts. The president has said he\u2019s skeptical about the finding regarding Russia, and that he and his aides didn\u2019t engage in any election interference with it. Russia has denied it meddled in the election.The hearing was organized after the discovery of emails showing the younger Mr. Trump had met with a Russian lawyer and a Russian American lobbyist. The lawyer,       Natalia Veselnitskaya       \u201cmight have information helpful to the campaign\u201d concerning Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, Democratic nominee       Hillary Clinton,        according to an email to Mr. Trump arranging the meeting. The gathering was also attended by Mr. Manafort and       Jared Kushner,        the president\u2019s son-in-law, who was a top election adviser.Ms. Veselnitskaya has said she used the meeting to advocate against the Magnitsky Act. The act is a 2012 U.S. law that punishes Russian officials accused of human-rights violations, and is named for Mr. Browder\u2019s lawyer, who died in a Russian jail in 2009.Mr. Browder told The Wall Street Journal last week that he is eager to testify, but Messrs. Manafort, Simpson and Trump haven't indicated if they will appear.Congressional subpoenas are mandatory summons to appear before Congress, but the legislature has had difficulty enforcing them in the past.

Dana Rohrabacher       (R., Calif.), left his job as a staff director on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the committee revealed this week. A person familiar with the matter said Mr. Behrends was fired over concerns about his Russia contacts.Mr. Behrends, who hasn\u2019t been accused of any wrongdoing, declined to comment.Mr. Behrends is a former Marine who has worked in politics on and off for decades. He worked for Mr. Rohrabacher as a Capitol Hill staffer in the 1990s before embarking on a career as a lobbyist. During his time in the private sector, he was the chief lobbyist for Blackwater, the military contractor that is now part of Constellis Holdings.In an interview, Mr. Rohrabacher confirmed there was a staffing dispute with the committee chairman but promised to reinstate Mr. Behrends or move him onto his congressional office staff.\u201cPaul Behrends has done a terrific job for me, and he\u2019ll continue working for me no matter what because he\u2019s been magnificent,\u201d Mr. Rohrabacher said. He called Mr. Behrends a patriot and said he has complete confidence in Mr. Behrends\u2019 integrity and loyalty.He said the removal of Mr. Behrends was the result of a policy disagreement with the committee\u2019s chairman, Rep.       Ed Royce       (R., Calif.). He declined to discuss more details about the dismissal, citing confidentiality.\u201cThe chairman obviously has a different point of view than what I have concerning Russia,\u201d said Mr. Rohrabacher, adding that the situation with Mr. Behrends stemmed from differences over \u201cwhat policy we believe is best for the United States concerning Russia.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Royce said Mr. Behrends no longer works at the foreign affairs committee.Mr. Behrends and Mr. Rohrabacher have each faced questions about their ties to Russia in recent weeks. The scrutiny comes amid investigations into Russia\u2019s alleged attempts to influence the 2016 election. Russia has denied the allegations.Politico reported this week that Mr. Behrends has a working relationship with Russian lawyer       Natalia Veselnitskaya       and Russian-American lobbyist       Rinat Akhmetshin.       Ms. Veselnitskaya and Mr. Akhmetshin met with       Donald Trump Jr.       and two other members of President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle in 2016, purportedly to give the Trump campaign damaging information about       Hillary Clinton.       Donald Trump Jr. later said nothing came of the meeting, and President Trump has denied anyone in his campaign colluded with Russia.Mr. Rohrabacher acknowledged to CNN that he met with Mr. Akhmetshin in April in Germany to discuss Russian sanctions and money-laundering issues.Mr. Behrends and Mr. Rohrabacher also traveled to Moscow in April 2016, where they received material from the Russian government as part of its advocacy effort against a sanctions package that was then moving through Congress, according to the Daily Beast.Mr. Rohrabacher is known on Capitol Hill for being a pro-Russia voice in Congress. He has long argued that the Cold War animosity between the two countries should give way to better relations. He is also known for his unorthodox policy stances within the GOP, such as advocacy for decriminalizing marijuana.Mr. Rohrabacher serves as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats, which has jurisdiction in the House of Representatives over many issues related to U.S. policy on Russia.Members of Congress typically have sole discretion on hiring office staff. Those staffers are paid out of an annual budget allotted to each member of Congress. Committee staffers are paid from a separate budget controlled by the chairman of the committee.Mr. Royce has discretion over the staff being paid by the committee, which includes Mr. Behrends.

But at least one senator who has voiced concerns about the bill\u2019s Medicaid cuts said Ms. Verma has taken a careful approach by providing data without overselling her proposal.\u201cShe\u2019s not in the business of lobbying, but she\u2019s in the business of getting us good information,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) said.Sen.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.) said, \u201cShe\u2019s obviously a knowledgeable person who\u2019s implemented innovative programs...That gives a great deal of street credibility.\u201dSen.       Susan Collins       of Maine, one of the Republicans who is opposed to the GOP bill, said she wasn\u2019t convinced by the pitch because the amount going to consumers would fall far short of the bill\u2019s $756 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid funding over a decade. Under the plan, up to $200 billion from the taxes would go to support affected low-income people.\u201cIf you\u2019re still going to take more than $700 billion out of the Medicaid program, you still have significant problems,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Administration officials, including Mr. Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price,        have visited Capitol Hill in recent days. Republican senators have frequently cited Ms. Verma as providing detailed arguments for the GOP bill.Still, Medicaid cuts are only one issue cited by Republicans concerned about the bill. Some worry about losing consumer protections; others fear premiums won\u2019t be reduced enough.Under the latest version of the Republican health bill, the number of uninsured would increase by 22 million in 2026, compared with the current law, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office released Thursday. Federal deficits would shrink by $420 billion over the coming decade, the CBO estimated.With President       Donald Trump       signaling Wednesday that the administration will play a more aggressive role in wrangling 50 senators to support the bill, it appears Ms. Verma, a 46-year-old daughter of Indian-American immigrants, will play a large role in the coming days.Ms. Verma cut her teeth professionally as a consultant to states, including Indiana, that introduced conservative changes to their Medicaid programs through a complex waiver process.On Monday, Ms. Verma met with Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.) and Mr. Portman. She met Wednesday morning with Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W.Va.), and that evening with about 20 senators gathered in the Capitol.At White House and Senate meetings Wednesday, Ms. Verma discussed the Medicaid provision at length. She has also been showing every senator numbers to illustrate how funds and waivers could affect their state, according to a person close to Ms. Verma. The goal is convincing them that the program could be put on a stable footing without hurting individuals, this person said.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who presides over the chamber\u2019s 52 Republicans, can lose only two GOP votes, with Mr. Pence casting a tiebreaking vote if necessary. His task has been complicated by Wednesday\u2019s announcement that Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) has been diagnosed with brain cancer; it isn\u2019t clear when he might return to Washington.The health debate has drawn Ms. Verma into an unfamiliar limelight, and White House officials said they are counting on her persuasiveness. They said they struggled in early phases of the House debate because Ms. Verma hadn\u2019t yet been confirmed, and they credit her with winning over House members at later stages.But many remain skeptical of her Medicaid proposal. Democrats and some Republicans said a one-time infusion of money, which aides and lawmakers said would likely be between $160 billion and $200 billion, wouldn\u2019t make up for far larger cuts to Medicaid over a longer period.\u201cThat\u2019s one of those tiny Band-Aids that you use for a child\u2019s cut,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.). \u201cI would hope that won\u2019t win over any votes just to postpone the pain for a couple years or a couple months.\u201dSenate leaders say they expect to vote next week on a motion allowing them to begin debate on a health bill. But if Ms. Verma\u2019s proposal looks like it is picking up votes, GOP leaders could delay the vote to gather more support.One of Ms. Verma\u2019s few public appearances not related to health care came at a White House event in May celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.She talked about growing up in the U.S. at a time when people confused Indians with Native Americans, asking her what tribe she was from.She remembered her mother ruining silk saris by putting them in a U.S. washing machine. And she joked about her father\u2019s criticism of her 95% score on a test and\u2014years later\u2014her son\u2019s score of 89% on a math test that her daughter dubbed an \u201cAsian fail.\u201dThe U.S. is different now, she said. People now ask her which part of India her family is from, and they associate India with yoga and meditation, \u201cwhich I can say I haven\u2019t done much of\u201d lately.\u2014Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-floats-proposal-to-ease-medicaid-cuts-1500594788", "keywords": [" affordable care act, bill, capitol hill, donald trump,health bill, health-care, medicaid, mitch mcconnell, obamacare, republicans, rob portman, seema verma, senate,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,Seema Verma,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:40:00", "news_title": "NYPD Officer Rejects Deal in James Blake Case to Avoid Disciplinary Trial", "content": "After months of negotiation, the New York Police Department officer who tackled a retired professional tennis star rejected a deal\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0that would have allowed him to avoid a department trial.Officer       James Frascatore       is now slated for a department disciplinary trial on Sept. 19 for tackling tennis star       James Blake,        37 years old, as he waited for a car outside of Manhattan\u2019s Grand Hyatt hotel near Grand Central Terminal in September 2015.\u201cAt a trial, we expect him to be cleared,\u201d said       Stephen Worth,        Officer Frascatore\u2019s lawyer. \u201cHe acted appropriately and followed his training.\u201dPolice said at the time that Office Frascatore, in plain clothes, misidentified Mr. Blake as the suspect in a credit-cart investigation. Two witnesses also pointed out Mr. Blake as the suspect, police said.The rejection comes after people involved with the negotiations said a deal between the two parties was imminent.Mr. Worth confirmed Thursday\u00a0he was planning a deal with the city independent police oversight agency prosecuting the case.The agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, investigated and\u00a0accused the officer of using excessive force\u00a0one month after the incident in September. The CCRB investigates civilian complaints against the NYPD and sometimes serves as the prosecution in department disciplinary trials at NYPD headquarters.Mr. Worth said the potential deal with the CCRB would have resulted in Officer Frascatore, who is currently on modified duty, losing vacation time and avoiding a trial.But at a hearing at NYPD headquarters\u00a0on Thursday, Officer Frascatore didn\u2019t accept the deal because the city hasn\u2019t provided written proof that Mr. Blake won\u2019t seek future litigation against the officer, Mr. Worth said.The city announced in June it would create a fellowship with the CCRB, as a part of a settlement with Mr. Blake.\u00a0The city didn\u2019t admit fault in that settlement. The agreement also included $175,000 to cover legal fees and expenses for Mr. Blake.A spokeswoman for the New York City law department said\u00a0Thursday\u00a0that as a part of that settlement, Mr. Blake \u201cagreed to release both the City and the police officer from litigation.\u201dKevin Marino,        a lawyer for Mr. Blake, said his client had nothing \u201cwhatsoever to do with the CCRB\u2019s charges.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what the plea agreement provides and has nothing to do with whether it was accepted or objected,\u201d Mr. Marino said.Mr. Blake, who is biracial, spoke publicly about the need for better relations between police and communities in the weeks after the incident in 2015. He also previously called for Officer Frascatore to be fired.While termination is a possibility in the trial, a senior law-enforcement official previously said it was unlikely Officer Frascatore would be fired.CCRB Executive Director       Jonathan Darche       said the CCRB would present evidence at the trial and \u201cis confident it will meet its burden.\u201d\u2014Corinne Ramey contributed to this article.Write to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nypd-officer-rejects-deal-in-james-blake-case-to-avoid-disciplinary-trial-1500594050", "keywords": ["civilian complaint review board,james blake,james frascatore,kevin marino,lawsuit,litigation,new york police department,nypd,police,settlement,stephen worth,tennis player,NYPD,Civilian Complaint Review Board,James Blake,James Frascatore,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,settlements,out-of-court agreements,political,general news,national,public security,crime,law enforcement,sports,tennis,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:35:00", "news_title": "EU Weighs Taking Action Against Poland ", "content": "BRUSSELS\u2014The European Union is threatening to deploy its most severe punishment on a member state for the first time, highlighting what it sees as Poland\u2019s grave departure from the bloc\u2019s core tenets.With Polish President       Andrzej Duda       poised to sign legislation into law that expands government control on the judiciary, Brussels may ask EU governments to formally warn Poland to reverse course, under provisions of Article 7 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty that aim to protect the rule of law and other democratic values. If Warsaw persists, EU governments could even impose sanctions on Poland up to suspending its voting rights.\u201cIt should come as no surprise to anyone that given the latest developments, we are coming very close to triggering Article 7,\u201d said       Frans Timmermans,        first vice president of the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm.The provision for such action first entered EU treaties as the bloc considered expanding eastward after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, with an eye to safeguarding its democratic principles. It was meant to fill a gap that results from the wide scope Brussels allows national governments over designing their democratic order.If the commission triggers Article 7, EU governments would have to muster the necessary four-fifths majority of states and the European Parliament\u2019s consent to warn Warsaw. Sanctions would be harder to introduce, requiring unanimity among the 27 members other than Poland. That is likely impossible given Hungary\u2019s support for Warsaw and its disagreement with Brussels over what a European democracy should look like.In a sign of the challenges to taking drastic action against a member of the bloc, the European Parliament last year rejected a push to impose Article 7 measures against Hungary. Budapest has largely evaded the EU\u2019s wrath, with Prime Minister       Viktor Orban       consolidating his power on an anti-EU platform despite losing some infringement procedures for breaking the bloc\u2019s laws.Poland\u2019s bills propelled the commission to start a dialogue with Warsaw in January 2016 to prevent a breach of EU rules and treaties. Failing to make headway, EU officials issued two recommendations in July and December of last year, advising Poland on how to align its changes with the bloc\u2019s criteria.Warsaw dismissed the EU\u2019s overtures as political interference.\u201cThese laws considerably increase the systemic threat in Poland to the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Timmermans said Wednesday. \u201cThey would abolish any remaining judiciary independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government.\u201dThe EU\u2019s executive body will adopt a third set of recommendations for Poland next week, he said. He added that the commission could also launch procedures that may result in legal enforcement and fines.\u201cThe European Union is not just about money and procedures. It is first and foremost about values and high standards,\u201d European Council President       Donald Tusk       said Thursday.

Mr. Trump needs the AG at this point more than the reverse.Mr. Trump is like no other President, and he proved it on Wednesday by telling the             New York Times                   that he would never have tapped Mr. Sessions for AG if he had known he would recuse himself from the investigation into Russia\u2019s 2016 campaign meddling. \u201cHe should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,\u201d Mr. Trump said, but Mr. Sessions didn\u2019t know at the time he would be presented with such a choice. He did so after news came out that he had met with the Russian ambassador during the campaign, and Mr. Sessions didn\u2019t want any political doubt hanging over the investigation.Mr. Trump is understandably upset about the special counsel probe into Russia, but Deputy AG       Rod Rosenstein       didn\u2019t appoint counsel       Robert Mueller       until months after Mr. Sessions recused himself. The political trigger for the special counsel appointment was Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of FBI Director       James Comey       followed by his tweet implying that he had tapes of his meetings with Mr. Comey.Mr. Sessions might have resigned after this presidential outburst, but we\u2019re glad he didn\u2019t.

The same goes on national security with Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis,        or on economic policy with adviser       Gary Cohn.       Working for a President who can be as willful and rash as Mr. Trump can\u2019t be easy, and some advisers may find it impossible over time.

We\u2019re referring to the Attorney General\u2019s decision this week to revive an asset forfeiture program whose overreach proved too much even for the       Obama       Administration.Civil asset forfeiture allows law enforcement officers to seize property such as homes and cars and cash thought to be paid for or generated by criminal activity. In 2015 then Attorney General       Eric Holder       restricted the practice. But before an audience of law-enforcement officials on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions revived it as a \u201ckey tool\u201d to \u201chit organized crime in the wallet.\u201d That\u2019s the theory. But it has many problems.The first is that taking property from citizens who have been convicted of no crime is constitutionally dubious. Mr. Sessions is also reviving a program that allows local law enforcement to seize these assets in conjunction with the feds. This lets them evade the laws in 14 states that bar asset forfeiture absent a criminal conviction. The feds and local cops share the spoils, an obvious incentive for abuse.Mr. Sessions says he\u2019s added new safeguards to prevent abuse. But       Robert Johnson,        an Institute for Justice lawyer who specializes in property rights, points out that these mostly come down to \u201ca pledge to be more careful.\u201d For example, Justice says it will now require a \u201cform that state and local law enforcement must fill out,\u201d which will then be reviewed by the department\u2019s lawyers. This is due process?It\u2019s not even clear this program helps actual law enforcement. In March the Justice Department Inspector General released a report on cash seizures and forfeiture. It focused in particular on the Drug Enforcement Agency, which accounted for 80% of Justice\u2019s cash seizures from 2007 to 2016.The IG found a fundamental problem. Because Justice has no \u201cseizure-specific metrics\u201d to evaluate how these seizures and forfeitures relate to criminal investigations, no one knows. In a sample of 100 cash seizures, the DEA could verify only 44 that \u201cadvanced or were related to criminal investigations.\u201dIn the past decade forfeitures under Justice\u2019s Asset Forfeiture Program have reached $28 billion. We all know what it\u2019s like to be ticketed by a police officer who is doing so as part of a quota designed to raise revenue. But what happens when you give the cop the right to take the car too? This dangerous practice cries out for a slap from the Supreme Court or an override by Congress that for once seems to have bipartisan agreement.Appeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-other-sessions-issue-1500593132", "keywords": ["political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,criminal enterprises,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:20:00", "news_title": "Microsoft Profit Jumps, Fueled by Cloud Computing", "content": "Microsoft Corp.

In the Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes the Office franchise, revenue climbed 21% to $8.4 billion.Microsoft doesn\u2019t disclose revenue figures for its Azure and Office 365 businesses, but it said Azure revenue jumped 97% and Office 365 revenue rose 43%.\u201cAzure was the primary source of our outperformance in the quarter,\u201d Microsoft finance chief       Amy Hood       said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s higher than I was expecting.\u201dOverall, Microsoft posted $6.51 billion in fourth-quarter net income, or 83 cents a share, compared with a profit of $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding the impact of revenue deferrals and other items, adjusted earnings climbed to 98 cents from 69 cents a year earlier. Per-share earnings in the most recent quarter included a 23-cent tax benefit related to Microsoft winding down its mobile-phone business.Revenue rose 13% to $23.32 billion and was $24.7 billion when adjusted to reflect Windows 10 revenue deferrals.Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected Microsoft to report adjusted per-share earnings of 71 cents, a figure that didn\u2019t include the 23-cent tax benefit, on $24.29 billion in adjusted revenue.Shares rose 3.1% to $76.50 in after-hours trading after results beat expectations.

At the end of the fourth quarter, the run-rate stood at $18.9 billion.\u201cObviously, we\u2019re feeling pretty confident about hitting\u201d the target, Ms. Hood said.The strides Microsoft has made in the cloud come as its legacy Windows operating-system business shrinks. Revenue in its More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows as well as the mobile-phone and gaming businesses, slid 2% to $8.8 billion. Last week, International Data Corp. reported world-wide PC shipments fell 3.3% in the second quarter, while             Gartner Inc.       estimated the drop at 4.3%.Revenue for Microsoft\u2019s Surface line of computers also fell 2%. Three months ago, that business was hit hard, registering a 26% revenue decline, which the company attributed to older Surface computers in the market, as well as increased price competition.Since then, Microsoft has introduced a new Surface laptop for the education market and an update to its Surface Pro tablet-laptop hybrid device, though those products made their debut with just a few weeks left in the quarter.LinkedIn Corp., the professional social network Microsoft acquired last December for $27 billion, added $1.07 billion in revenue and posted a $361 million operating loss. Microsoft is working to connect its business products to LinkedIn, giving sales representatives using its Dynamics software, for example, tools to easily mine the professional social network to prospect for leads.Like its cloud rivals Amazon and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Microsoft is spending lavishly to build giant and expensive data centers around the world to deliver its cloud services. In the quarter, Microsoft spent $3.3 billion on capital expenses, with much of that money going toward its data center expansion. A year ago, Microsoft had $3.1 billion in capital expenses.In the current quarter, Microsoft expects revenue in its Intelligent Cloud business of between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion, up from $6.38 billion a year earlier. Revenue in its Productivity and Business Processes segment should land between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion, including about $1.1 billion from LinkedIn. A year earlier, that segment posted $6.66 billion. Microsoft said the More Personal Computing segment\u2019s revenue will be between $8.6 billion and $8.9 billion, compared with $9.29 billion a year ago.Write to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Microsoft Forges Ahead In Cloud.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cloud-computing-helps-power-microsoft-earnings-1500583095", "keywords": ["cloud computing,microsoft earnings, on-demand computing , tech earnings, web-based software,Amazon.com,AMZN,Microsoft,MSFT,Alphabet,GOOG,financial performance,earnings,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,retail,wholesale,etailing,internet search engines,computing,e-commerce,online service providers,productivity software,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:20:00", "news_title": "China Portrays U.S. Trade Talks in Glowing Light", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Chinese negotiators on Thursday characterized high-level U.S.-China talks that appeared to end without progress as \u201cpositive,\u201d saying the two sides were cooperating to narrow Washington\u2019s $347 billion trade deficit with Beijing.The negotiators said Beijing would work on U.S. priorities including expanding services trade with the U.S., reducing excess capacity in its steel industry and boosting agricultural imports, according to a lengthy statement released by the Chinese Embassy in Washington. It wasn\u2019t clear whether these were new pledges or restatements of past positions.The embassy said the Wednesday talks were marked by a \u201ccandid and friendly spirit\u201d and produced \u201cpositive outcomes,\u201d including a fresh set of talks to stretch over the coming year.U.S. officials didn\u2019t immediately comment on the Chinese statement. A day earlier they issued only a terse statement. On Wednesday, Chinese officials in Beijing painted a rosier picture of Wednesday\u2019s talks, with one describing them as \u201cinnovative, practical and constructive.\u201dThe differing responses appear to reflect the political objectives of the two nations, said Eswar Prasad, a China scholar at Cornell University.Beijing wants to show it can keep U.S.-China relations on an even keel before a Communist Party conference this fall where the senior leadership will be chosen, Mr. Prasad said. \u201cThe statement is meant for the audience back home,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very keen to convey the impression that everything is smooth on the U.S-China economic front.\u201dThe U.S. administration has a different purpose: showing that it can make progress in reducing the trade deficit, which President       Donald Trump       has blamed for what he says is American economic decline. So, from his perspective, tension and uncertainty in the relationship can be used to try to change the status quo.\u201cAny tension in the relationship is something the U.S. could live with and something the Chinese want to avoid,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.It is unclear which side has the upper hand in future talks. The most contentious issues involves the trade deficit and Chinese steel overcapacity.U.S. officials were dissatisfied with the Chinese unwillingness to make specific commitments to reduce the deficit, said trade experts briefed on the talks.Still, some Western trade economists say Beijing is justified in resisting quantitative targets. That is because trade measures may affect exports and imports in particular sectors, they say, but aren\u2019t generally enough to alter the overall deficit.China\u2019s embassy said the two sides agreed that reducing the deficit was a \u201cpriority\u201d for both nations and they would \u201cstep up cooperation, manage differences and conduct constructive cooperation.\u201d But it didn\u2019t offer anything concrete.When it comes to excess capacity in the steel industry, the Chinese said the two sides agreed to \u201cactive and effective measures to jointly address this global issue,\u201d but it didn\u2019t provide specifics.That may not satisfy the Trump administration, which is debating whether to levy tariffs on imports of steel from China and elsewhere in a bid to force Beijing to meet specific benchmarks for cutting production overcapacity, which is weighing on global steel prices.On agriculture, the Chinese said the two sides discussed several steps including China lifting its two-year-old avian influenza-related ban on U.S. poultry meat. The American chicken industry has pushed China to tailor such bans regionally\u2014as opposed to universal bans\u2014and have set up visits for Chinese officials to tour U.S. plants.Officials from the two countries also discussed China\u2019s economic restrictions on some U.S. grain products and exports of Chinese dairy products to the U.S., according to the Chinese statement.Myron Brilliant,        executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the Chinese pledges fell short.\u201cWhile it\u2019s important that China and the U.S. put issues on table, we want to see more tangible progress made in a range of structural, regulatory and other concerns that have been longstanding irritants in U.S.\u2013China relationship,\u201d he said.Write to Bob Davis at bob.davis@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'China Touts Progress in U.S. Talks.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-portrays-u-s-trade-talks-in-glowing-light-1500592831", "keywords": ["china trade, china trade deficit, trump xi, u..s. china relations, u.s. china trade,economic performance,indicators,trade figures,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:17:00", "news_title": "Saudi Arabia Overhauls Security Apparatus  ", "content": "BEIRUT\u2014Saudi Arabia on Thursday announced far-reaching changes to its security apparatus, establishing a new entity in charge of national security and stripping power from the ministry of interior.The new body, called the State Security Directorate, will report directly to the Saudi monarch and take over key responsibilities from the ministry of interior, including domestic intelligence, special-operation forces and other counterterrorism functions.The announcement, made in a series of royal decrees, came weeks after a major leadership reshuffle in the kingdom that resulted in the removal of former Crown Prince and Minister of Interior Mohammed bin Nayef from his posts.He was replaced as crown prince by Mohammed bin Salman, the monarch\u2019s powerful 31-year-old son, who is spearheading an overhaul of the kingdom\u2019s economy and government bureaucracy under a program known as Vision 2030.Saudi Arabia is one of America\u2019s most important security allies in the Middle East, and U.S. officials had long viewed Mohammed bin Nayef, known as Saudi Arabia\u2019s counterterrorism czar, as one of Washington\u2019s most trusted partners in the kingdom.In a show of continuity with his tenure, one of Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s closest aides, Gen. Abdulaziz al Huwairini, was selected to lead the new security body. He retains his role as head of the domestic intelligence agency, the Mabahith.A Saudi official said the change would elevate the work of Saudi Arabia\u2019s counterterror forces. Gen. al Huwairini is well known to U.S. officials and will report directly to the king, the official said.\u201cThe rationale here is a matter of efficiency,\u201d the official said. \u201dThis will be an improvement to our counterterror capabilities.\u201dThe changes help reduce the bureaucratic load on the ministry of interior, which handles issues ranging from traffic control and marriage-related administrative tasks, on top of its previous counterterrorism duties.\u201cA lot of the important divisions of the ministry of interior now answer directly to the Directorate of State Security\u2014anything that touches directly on counterterrorism and state security,\u201d said Mohammed Alyahya, a Saudi political analyst and a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council. \u201cHuwairini was one of the most important people under Mohammed bin Nayef\u2014and he is now the head of this new body established under       Mohammed bin Salman.       It was a seamless transition.\u201dMohammed bin Nayef was in charge of Saudi Arabia\u2019s successful campaign against al Qaeda in the mid-2000s and more recently took on the challenge of confronting Islamic State, whose loyalists have carried out small-scale attacks in the kingdom.The new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is also minister of defense, has increasingly assumed a more prominent role on security matters since his father became king in early 2015. He is leading Saudi Arabia\u2019s military involvement in Yemen and is seeking to establish a loose coalition of Muslim-majority countries dedicated to countering terrorism.\u2014Felicia Schwartz in Washington, D.C., contributed to this article.Write to Margherita Stancati at margherita.stancati@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-overhauls-security-apparatus-1500592641", "keywords": ["mohammad bin nayef,mohammed bin salman,saudi arabia crown prince ,saudi arabia security,sauid arabia terrorism"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:17:00", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s Nafta Stakes", "content": "President       Trump       campaigned on tearing up Nafta, but maybe he\u2019s learning on the job. The White House this week rolled out its objectives for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement that could allow him to claim victory without doing too much protectionist damage.The President has blamed Nafta for U.S. manufacturers moving jobs to Mexico. In April Mr. Trump came close to terminating the deal before cooler heads in the Administration persuaded him that withdrawing would be a disaster for U.S. businesses, especially farmers.Nafta has helped American businesses stay competitive and prevented a larger exodus of jobs overseas by integrating cross-border supply chains. Consider       Cummins,        which makes the engine for Chrysler\u2019s RAM truck outside Columbus, Ind. Cummins exports its engines to a Chrysler plant in Mexico, where the trucks are assembled and sent back to the states. Prior to Nafta, Mexico imposed tariffs as high as 20% on automotive imports as well as local content requirements of 80% that shut out U.S. suppliers like Cummins.American inputs make up 40% of Mexican products exported to the U.S. Since 2007 U.S. exports of auto parts to Mexico have more than doubled. Nafta has enabled U.S. auto makers to compete with the Japanese, and many cars assembled in Mexico with American parts are shipped to Asia and Europe. Another example of cross-border integration: Canadian manufacturers use U.S. scrap metal, coal and iron to produce steel slab and coil for American vehicles, airplanes and public works.Some of Nafta\u2019s biggest winners are American farmers. Nafta cut Mexico\u2019s high agricultural tariffs\u2014ranging from 15% on soybeans and processed vegetables to 215% on corn\u2014to zero on most products. U.S. exports of feedstock to Mexico have soared. Soybean sales to Mexico have quintupled since Nafta was finalized in 1993. Farm and ranch exports to Mexico and Canada have more than quadrupled.It\u2019s true that Canada\u2019s supply-managed dairy system remains walled off from competition, and pricing policies discriminate against such U.S. products as a milk-protein used to make cheese. Canada also maintains high tariffs on U.S. poultry, eggs and wine. Mr. Trump should seek to ease these trade barriers in return for giving up some U.S. farm subsidies.A major focus of U.S. Trade Representative       Robert Lighthizer\u2019s       agenda will be e-commerce, financial services, telecommunications and intellectual property. This recognizes that trade in services is growing fast and an area in which the U.S. has a significant comparative advantage. For instance, the Administration says it aims to \u201csecure commitments not to impose customs duties on digital products\u201d and to prevent restrictions on sending and storing data.The Administration will also try to \u201cstrengthen the rules of origin,\u201d which require a certain share of products to be sourced in North America\u2014e.g., 62.5% for autos\u2014to qualify for preferential trade treatment. One risk of raising the thresholds is that manufacturers may decide it makes more sense to move abroad and pay an import tariff.Canada and Mexico adopted many of the Administration\u2019s objectives in the stillborn Trans-Pacific Partnership, so the biggest sticking points will likely be trade remedies. Mr. Lighthizer has called for eliminating Nafta\u2019s \u201cglobal safeguard exclusion\u201d to allow the U.S. to take action if a surge of imports imperils its domestic industries. He also wants to let the U.S. \u201cimpose measures based on third country dumping.\u201d So the U.S. could, say, levy duties on Mexican products with Chinese steel, though such actions would likely be challenged and invite retaliatory tariffs.Nafta allows investors to arbitrate disputes with foreign governments. The Administration is targeting this system as some on the right claim that it undermines U.S. sovereignty. Unions also hate arbitration because it reduces the risk of investing in Canada and Mexico. But the system has protected American investors from arbitrary policies, and the U.S. government has never lost a case.The White House wants to conclude negotiations by the end of this year, though they could drag on if it tries to back Canada and Mexico into protectionist corners. While the President may think he has the whip hand, the U.S. can\u2019t afford to jilt its neighbors. Mexico is currently renegotiating its 2000 trade accord with the European Union to boost its trade in services and agriculture. It is also seeking to reduce its dependence on U.S. agriculture. During 2017\u2019s first four months, Mexican imports of U.S. soybean meal fell 15%. Canada has just concluded a deal with Europe.If Mr. Trump wants a political victory, he\u2019ll push to further open Mexican and Canadian markets rather than impose trade barriers that hurt American businesses and consumers.Appeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-nafta-stakes-1500592674", "keywords": ["North American Free Trade Agreement,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:17:00", "news_title": "A Bad GOP Dream", "content": "President Trump sometimes campaigned on deporting every illegal immigrant in the U.S., but in office he has been measured and charitable to those he calls the \u201cincredible kids\u201d who were brought to the U.S. as children. So it\u2019s regrettable that Republican state politicians are trying to bully Mr. Trump into deporting tens of thousands of young adults with no criminal record.Last month 10 state attorneys general wrote to Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       asking that the Secretary of Homeland Security end an Obama Administration program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. DACA currently allows about 750,000 individuals brought to America as kids to stay in the U.S. for two years subject to renewal without the threat of deportation. These are the so-called Dreamers.The letter asks that the government \u201crescind the June 15, 2012 DACA memorandum and order that the Executive Branch will not renew or issue any new DACA or Expanded DACA permits in the future,\u201d and it threatens to sue if the Administration declines to act. The ringleader seems to be       Ken Paxton       of Texas and the AG list includes       Patrick Morrisey       of West Virginia and       Derek Schmidt       of Kansas.Earlier this year Homeland Security rolled back the Obama Administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, which usurped Congress\u2019s law-writing power and applied prosecutorial discretion to an entire class of individuals. The courts blocked that Obama order.DACA has similar constitutional deficiencies, but the way to address them is through Congress, not by Republicans suing a GOP President who didn\u2019t write the law. There is also the legal question of what to do now that the government has invited individuals to identify themselves. Is it fair to coax them out of the shadows and then deport them to countries where they have no family and little memory?Remember: Dreamers were brought here as minors and are not criminals, and those who commit an offense forfeit their legal status under DACA. A January       Cato       Institute analysis by       Ike Brannon       says that Dreamers as employees tend to \u201cbe younger, better educated, and more highly paid than the typical immigrant.\u201dThe average Dreamer is 22 and holds a job, and many pay tuition for higher education. More than 15% are seeking an advanced degree. Texas and other states rightly claimed that under DAPA the feds commandeered state resources because they had to provide driver\u2019s licenses. But the states may be net beneficiaries under DACA due to tuition payments.Cato\u2019s Mr. Brannon adds that deporting the Dreamers would cost $60 billion and even more to the U.S. economy, as the legal reprieve allows many to enter the labor force. The cost of granting DACA status is de minimis; applicants pay processing fees and are ineligible for food stamps or Medicaid. The federal government routinely claims to lack the funding and personnel to remove convicted criminals from the U.S., yet the state AGs would dedicate scarce enforcement resources to going door-to-door in a University of Texas dorm.The better solution is for Congress to rewrite national immigration law to recognize reality, including that it isn\u2019t a political winner to deport people brought to the country as five-year-olds. A majority in both parties would favor legalizing Dreamers as part of a border enforcement bill. The state AGs have higher priorities than chasing down law-abiding young people contributing to American society, and a lawsuit would be political grandstanding rather than sensible law enforcement.Appeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-bad-gop-dream-1500506638", "keywords": ["political,general news,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:12:00", "news_title": "Blackstone Made Bid to Buy Hotel Investor RLJ Lodging Trust ", "content": "Blackstone Group        BX -0.17%       LP recently made a roughly $3 billion bid to acquire             RLJ Lodging Trust,        RLJ -1.36%       a move that if successful would end RLJ\u2019s agreement to acquire rival hotel investor             FelCor Lodging Trust Inc.

Coverage of autism used to see a lot of this: There were headlines like \u201cThe Kids With the Faraway Eyes\u201d (Rolling Stone), \u201cThe Trance Children\u201d (Time) or \u201cThe Strangers in Our Midst\u201d (McCall\u2019s). The goal of such an approach is obvious: to get general readers to feel and to care. But fascination-driven narrative can become exploitative, reducing real people with challenging conditions to convenient specimens, put on display for the public\u2019s voyeuristic curiosity.Jennifer Latson       avoids these pitfalls in \u201cThe Boy Who Loved Too Much: A True Story of Pathological Friendliness,\u201d even though her title does play the fascination card pretty hard. The book is an account of Williams syndrome, a genetic condition that affects cardiovascular function, visual perception, dexterity, growth, lifespan and learning ability. But another symptom is always evident as well\u2014a craving for amicable human contact, what Ms. Latson calls an \u201cinsatiable drive to connect.\u201d So powerful is this compulsion that, in the daily lives of people with Williams, it bursts through continuously, in ways both endearing and disruptive. People with Williams regularly declare their affection to people who just happen to be passing within eyesight or earshot, whether true acquaintances or random strangers. They like to get physical, too. The mailman, the ticket taker at the ballgame, the fellow passenger on a plane\u2014around a Williams person, all become targets for unannounced, unrequested and unnerving hugs.That is an exotic behavior, and Williams\u2014which only affects 1 in 10,000 people and is therefore considered \u201crare\u201d\u2014hardly gets any attention in the media. Ms. Latson asks us to care by suggesting that \u201cthe findings from this rare disorder have far-reaching repercussions for the rest of us,\u201d and in fact she makes this case convincingly: The key breakthrough was the unambiguous discovery of specific gene deletions in people with the condition\u2014including, curiously, the gene that governs production of the substance that helps skin bounce back to its starting shape after being pinched or stretched. Its role in Williams is unclear, but the specificity gives researchers a genetic address to work from. Related genes, she reports, have led to new insights about high blood pressure.By Jennifer Latson  Simon & Schuster, 290 pages, $26The narrative that takes up most of the book\u2019s pages is a sensitively drawn portrait of the boy referred to in the title, who is given the pseudonym Eli and whose daily reality Ms. Latson appears to have made an extraordinary effort to get to know. The author\u2019s acquaintance with Eli is longitudinal, covering the three years beginning just after he had turned 12. She clearly spent significant amounts of time with Eli and his family, which also included his single-parent mother, Gayle (also a pseudonym), and sometimes his grandmother. Long stretches of dialogue\u2014during lengthy car rides, at family gatherings, in counseling sessions\u2014indicate that Ms. Latson had a tape recorder running, or else was a phenomenal notetaker, because the conversation rings true. It also works to let this family tell its own story.That story, painfully, is one of constantly threatening heartbreak, as Ms. Latson chronicles Eli\u2019s aspirations of instant intimacy with all those he meets, and witnesses their repeated failure of his efforts to connect. Too quick with a compliment, too ready with a smile of his extra-wide mouth (which, along with an upturned nose, small chin and puffiness around the eyes, is part of the classic set of facial features that go with Williams), he is all too often met with snickers, shrugs or the backside of a shoulder. As Ms. Latson lays it out, his dreams of friendship seemed doomed from the start, because of a certain ironic truth of human nature: Most of us set limits to the intensity of affection we can tolerate coming from others. If asked to clarify for someone else where we draw that line, most of us would probably be hard-pressed to place it exactly. For Eli, who crossed it all the time, it was virtually invisible.Thankfully, Eli seems oblivious to the snubs. Not so his mother, who opened up to Ms. Latson about the many ways in which raising a boy like Eli caused an unwanted revolution in her life. Hurting over every rejection she sees Eli encounter, fearful that a cruel world will treat him shoddily, Gayle makes herself his full-time friend and protector. She gives herself over to this role fully, but not without some sorrow over the limits the responsibility places on her own life. Only late in the story, when she learns that the other children in his mainstream classes have been looking out for him all along\u2014because they\u2019d had their entire school lives to get used to his ways\u2014does Gayle catch a glimpse of a future where, perhaps, Eli will be able to get along without her.This raises the question of society\u2019s acceptance of difference, a discussion that gains much from Ms. Latson\u2019s efforts to explore the importance of social contexts in shaping the experience of people with Williams. She reports, for example, that those with the syndrome who live in Japan face a great deal more public hostility than who reside in the U.S.: To the Japanese, the gregarious behaviors that come with Williams are more in conflict with long ingrained social norms of reserve, personal space and privacy. This suggests Eli\u2019s chances for success or failure in life might still depend meaningfully on how he is met by those of us who know little of Williams syndrome. It\u2019s an open question whether we will respond as positively as his classmates did, but Ms. Latson\u2019s book makes a persuasive case that we should try.Mr. Donvan is the co-author, with       Caren Zucker,        of \u201cIn a Different Key: The Story of Autism.\u201dAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-hugs-than-most-can-bear-1500592322", "keywords": ["book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:11:00", "news_title": "Capital One Profit, Revenue Rise", "content": "Capital One Financial Corp.        COF -1.58%       said its second-quarter earnings and revenue rose, helped by a ramp-up in credit-card balances industrywide and the rise in interest rates.Profit for the quarter increased 10%, to $1.04 billion, or $1.94 a share, from $942 million, or $1.69 a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 7% to $6.7 billion. Results beat analyst estimates, and shares jumped in after-hours trading.Capital One, which has large credit-card and auto-lending divisions, said its net interest margin increased 0.15 percentage point from the year-ago quarter, largely due to higher interest rates and growth in its domestic card business. Credit-card interest rates generally rise following Federal Reserve rate increases.Despite beating analyst expectations, borrower performance remains a top issue for the bank, which is known for its history as a large subprime credit-card lender. The company is a good indicator of the general state of consumers\u2019 ability to repay their debts because, unlike some other card issuers, it primarily doesn\u2019t focus on extending credit to the affluent.The bank wrote off more delinquent loans as losses and set more money aside to cover for future losses. Both issues are being watched by shareholders amid concerns over whether consumer credit is in the early stages of deteriorating.Credit concerns resurfaced on Thursday after another credit-card company reported earnings. Shares of             Alliance Data Systems Corp.      , a large store credit-card issuer, closed down 9.5% on Thursday, after the issuer that had projected a 2017 credit-loss rate in the mid-5% range was noncommittal on its charge-off rate outlook on its earnings call. ADS also cut 2017 core earnings per share estimates from $18.50 to $18.10.Capital One\u2019s net charge-off rate for domestic credit cards was 5.11% for the second quarter, down slightly from the first quarter, but up 1.04 percentage points from a year ago.Provisions for overall credit losses hit $1.8 billion in the second quarter, down 10% from the prior quarter but up 13% from the year-ago period.In April, the company reported first-quarter earnings that missed analyst estimates, largely due to a 33% jump in provisions for loan losses in the company\u2019s U.S. credit-card business from the previous quarter.In June, the Federal Reserve conditionally approved Capital One\u2019s capital plan in the regulator\u2019s annual \u201cstress tests,\u201d saying the firm would have to resubmit its plan by Dec. 28 to address shortcomings in its process.The Fed said Capital One \u201cexhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning practices.\u201d If the revised plan doesn\u2019t satisfy the Fed, the regulator said that it may restrict the firm\u2019s capital distributions. At the time, Capital One Chairman and Chief Executive       Richard Fairbank       said the bank is \u201cfully committed to addressing the Federal Reserve\u2019s concerns.\u201dWrite to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/capital-one-revenue-rises-in-second-quarter-1500585067", "keywords": ["alliance data systems,capital one earnings,capital one profit,capital one results,capital one revenue, charge-off rates, credit card companies,earnings season,Capital One Financial,COF,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,credit types,services,credit cards,banking,credit,financial services,plastic cards"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:10:00", "news_title": "How to Beat the High Cost of Gravity", "content": "A lot is going on in outer space. Recently       Elon Musk\u2019s       SpaceX launched three commercial Falcon 9 missions from Florida and California in less than two weeks. One reused a first stage from a previous flight. SpaceX will likely succeed in its aim of launching 20 or so Falcon missions this year, including an unmanned test of the Dragon capsule intended to carry American astronauts back and forth to the International Space Station.At the same time       Jeff Bezos      \u2019 Blue Origins is continuing to test its       New Shepard       reusable suborbital tourism rocket. The next stage is the giant New Glenn Reusable Launch vehicle, which would dramatically reduce the cost of getting payloads and people into space.Messrs. Bezos and Musk are both committed to spreading civilization beyond Earth. Mr. Musk wants to colonize Mars, while Mr. Bezos wants to develop an extraterrestrial economy with asteroid mining and space manufacturing. There are other, poorer entrepreneurs, sometimes called \u201cnew space,\u201d dedicated to these goals.If SpaceX keeps gaining market share and Blue Origins builds and launches its New Glenn rocket, the cost of getting off the ground (literally) will be dramatically reduced, possibly to as little as $10 a pound to low-Earth orbit. That would make the dreams of both Messrs. Musk and Bezos possible, indeed highly profitable.Low-cost access to space also has military implications. For the U.S., it will be easier for the Pentagon to deploy communications, navigation and reconnaissance satellites. This will be especially useful if the Defense Department follows through on evident congressional desire to develop and deploy a comprehensive set of space-based missile-defense sensors to guide America\u2019s next generation of interceptor missiles.Europeans are also interested in reducing the cost of launching. They\u2019re working on an Ariane 6 launch vehicle they hope will allow them to regain some of the market share they have lost to SpaceX. China and Russia are developing new rockets no doubt to imitate the American billionaires\u2019 success. Aviation Week reports China may be getting serious about developing its own reusable launch vehicles.Further, China and Russia are reportedly working hard on a variety of antisatellite weapons. The debris from China\u2019s 2007 test of a kinetic space weapon is still floating around, a reminder of what the effects of a space war might be.Cheap access to space will make it easier to put a variety of weapons into orbit\u2014not just missile defense but space-to-Earth weapons. The high military value of space assets makes them obvious targets in any future conflict.The temptation to believe that arms-control agreements could prevent a so-called arms race in space is strong, but in recent years we\u2019ve watched while some of the most significant arms-control agreements have been trashed. In Syria the Chemical Weapons Convention was ignored with minimal consequences. Russia has almost certainly violated the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement and both Iran and North Korean have reaped considerable benefits from departing, informally or formally, from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Any agreement to control arms in space would be useless.For good or ill, humanity is expanding into the solar system. Americans should hope for the best, but the future may not be peaceful, on Earth or in space. On June 30 President       Trump       kept his promise to re-establish the National Space Council, with Vice President       Mike Pence       as chairman. Its most important job will be to reconcile America\u2019s scientific, commercial and military interests in space. If currently pending legislation is enacted, the Space Council will have a role to play in establishing a new branch of the armed forces, the Space Corps.Mr. Dinerman       writes on space policy and national security.Appeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-beat-the-high-cost-of-gravity-1500592209", "keywords": ["federal contractors,silicon valley,space exploration,SpaceX,Elon Musk,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,politics,international relations,domestic politics,sciences,humanities,travel,weapons programs,commentaries,opinions,aerospace products,parts,space vehicles,aerospace,defense,industrial goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:09:00", "news_title": "The Martyrdom of Jacques Hamel", "content": "Dominique Lebrun,        the archbishop of Rouen, France, was attending the Catholic Church\u2019s World Youth Day in Poland last July when the news came. One of his priests, 85-year-old Father       Jacques Hamel,        had been murdered by Islamic State-inspired terrorists while celebrating morning mass on July 26.Archbishop Lebrun soon received an urgent request from       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,        then the French president. Fearful of civil unrest between the nation\u2019s Christians and Muslims, Mr. Hollande requested the archbishop speak with him before making any public statements. \u201cWhat will you say?\u201d the president asked the archbishop. \u201cI am going to pray and ask God to help me love my enemies,\u201d he replied.A few months later, Mr. Hollande admitted the prelate had stunned him: He actually seemed to believe what he was saying, and his tone of forgiveness and reconciliation was crucial after the attack. The following week Muslims throughout the country were encouraged by Islamic leaders to attend Mass as a show of solidarity with their Catholic neighbors.The killing moved millions of people, including       Pope Francis.       In September the pope described Hamel as a martyr. He urged Catholics to ask for the intercession of the late priest so that he \u201cgives us the courage to say the truth: to kill in the name of God is satanic.\u201d The Vatican has fast-tracked Hamel\u2019s path to sainthood, and Francis has already declared him \u201cblessed,\u201d the first step in the canonization process.In an earlier era, France\u2019s leader would not have been so shocked by the archbishop\u2019s words of forgiveness. Once thought of as a Catholic country, France, like much of Europe, has abandoned any overt association with its Christian heritage over the past several decades. If Europe\u2019s political leaders were somehow able to reclaim the attitude of sacrifice and solidarity embodied by Archbishop Lebrun\u2019s statement, it could reshape the way their ailing continent deals with terrorism and the anti-immigrant, populist backlash it produces.In the aftermath of World War II, when nations throughout Europe were on the verge of collapse, the project of European integration was born to ensure that the war\u2019s atrocities could never be repeated. There was a strong sense that those who had died in the war had sacrificed themselves so that others could live in freedom and prosperity. In the new European project, stronger countries would help weaker ones. They had a moral responsibility.And while the European Union has at times been hostile to religious concerns, it nonetheless has been undergirded by the Catholic doctrine of solidarity. This principle demands shared responsibility and sacrifice in spiritual and physical matters, between nations and peoples, rich and poor. A core commitment to the belief in the dignity of all human beings means that the practice of solidarity isn\u2019t one of mere charity, but one of Christian duty.Speaking to European heads of state this spring, Pope Francis argued that solidarity was the antidote to populism and extremism. \u201cPolitics needs this kind of leadership, which avoids appealing to emotions to gain consent,\u201d he argued, adding that the European Union needs \u201ca spirit of solidarity and subsidiarity.\u201dIs it a coincidence that in an era of nationalist populism, the one country that offered a resounding rejection of such principles is the one where an elderly priest was brutally beheaded while offering his daily mass? Could it be that, in this secular European nation, Hamel\u2019s martyrdom triggered, unconsciously, an examination of conscience, stirring many French citizens to reconsider the type of future they want to build and the values they want to define them?In his statement after Hamel\u2019s death, Archbishop Lebrun noted that the attack produced three victims: the priest and his two killers. Hamel\u2019s brutal end personified true sacrifice while his attackers\u2019 deaths perverted it. Perhaps the witness of this modern martyr will lead to an embrace of this traditional teaching of solidarity, and therein shore up the foundation of a country and a continent.Mr. White       is the director of Catholic Voices USA.Appeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'The Martyrdom of Father Jacques Hamel.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-martyrdom-of-jacques-hamel-1500592160", "keywords": ["catholic church,islamic terrorism,the west,political,general news,national,public security,society,community,crime,legal action,murder,manslaughter,religion,terrorism,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:08:00", "news_title": "Our Self-Interested Senators", "content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at this point has busted pretty much every move in his effort to rally 50 votes for an       Obama      Care replacement. He\u2019s listened. He\u2019s negotiated. He\u2019s encouraged. He\u2019s cajoled. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.Months later, still lacking a majority, the time has come for the Kentucky Republican to execute the final, clarifying move. It\u2019s time for       Mr. McConnell       to make this all about his self-interested members.Up to now, this exercise has been about trying to improve health care and the federal fisc. The House bill isn\u2019t perfect\u2014no bill ever is\u2014but it amounts to the biggest entitlement reform in history. It repeals crushing taxes. It dramatically cuts spending. And it begins the process of stabilizing the individual health-care market and expanding consumer freedom.None of this is good enough for a handful of senators, so now it\u2019s time to make this exercise all about them. Mr. McConnell should make clear that the overwhelming majority of the Republican Party stands ready to make good on its repeal-and-replace campaign promise\u2014and that it would have done so already were it not for a cynical or egotistic few. It\u2019s time for some very public accountability.That rests in Mr. McConnell giving his caucus a drop-dead date to broker a compromise, after which he will proceed to bring up the House bill. And any Republican who votes against moving forward, \u201ca motion to proceed,\u201d will forever be known as the Republican who saved ObamaCare. The Republican who voted to throw billions more taxpayer dollars at failing entitlement programs and collapsing insurance markets. The Republican who abandoned struggling American families. The Republican who voted against a tax cut and spending reductions. The Republican who made Chuck Schumer\u2019s year.And that\u2019s only a short list of the real-world accountability. That vote might also provide home-state voters a new, eye-opening means to account for the character of their senators. Few things drive conservative voters battier than phony politicians, those who say one thing and do another to avoid hard choices.Nearly every Senate Republican is on record having voted to repeal ObamaCare\u2014back when they knew that President Obama\u2019s veto made the vote consequence-free. And to be crystal clear, any senator who now votes against simply proceeding to debate is doing so for just one reason: To again avoid consequences, to again avoid accountability.Because the good senators understand just how illuminating those votes would be. Under the Senate reconciliation process, anyone can offer endless amendments\u2014with roll-call votes.Voters would be able to see just how gigantic a Medicaid payoff Ohio\u2019s       Rob Portman,        Nevada\u2019s       Dean Heller       and West Virginia\u2019s       Shelley Moore Capito       are demanding for their support. They\u2019d watch supposed conservatives such as Tennessee\u2019s       Bob Corker       vote against pro-growth tax cuts. They\u2019d observe Utah\u2019s       Mike Lee       offer up changes to ObamaCare mandates, muster not even a dozen votes, and realize how unpopular his position is. They\u2019d witness Kentucky\u2019s       Rand Paul       vote against all reform ideas\u2014no matter how good\u2014because they still weren\u2019t good enough for Rand Paul.They\u2019d see Alaska\u2019s       Lisa Murkowski       cynically vote against the very same repeal-only amendment she supported in 2015, back when it didn\u2019t matter. They\u2019d see South Carolina\u2019s       Lindsey Graham       and Louisiana\u2019s       Bill Cassidy       cast the only two votes for a bill they\u2019ve been pushing\u2014and confusing everyone with\u2014for weeks.Mr. McConnell can meanwhile count on a great deal of help in this accountability effort. Conservative grass-roots groups have tried to play a constructive role throughout this debate, but they have had it with Senate egos. They\u2019re mobilizing to name names. The chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition,       Ralph Reed,        sent a letter to every senator on Thursday, explaining that his group would be watching the voting and documenting any \u201cno\u201d votes on \u201ctens of millions of congressional scorecards and voter guides to be distributed in 117,000 churches nationwide in 2018.\u201dA flood of other conservative outfits\u2014the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, Tea Party Patriots\u2014are launching websites and             Twitter                   campaigns to highlight holdouts. Some groups are planning primary challenges against those who refuse to debate a bill. The Murkowskis of the world may be hoping nobody will remember by the time they\u2019re up for re-election, but they shouldn\u2019t count on that.What the Senate leadership most needs to stress these coming days is that senators who claim they can\u2019t \u201csupport\u201d debating a flawed bill are snowing voters. Don\u2019t like the bill? Get it to the floor and offer amendments. But do it in the open. Do it with some accountability.Maybe, finally under the public glare, Republicans will get their act together.Write to kim@wsj.com.Appeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/our-self-interested-senators-1500592123", "keywords": ["health care reform,obamacare,senate republicans,trump administration,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,commentaries,opinions,health care,life sciences"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:07:00", "news_title": "NYC Councilman Is Guilty of Public Corruption ", "content": "New York City Councilman       Ruben Wills       was convicted of public corruption charges\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0in Queens County Supreme Court.Mr. Wills, a Queens Democrat, used a charity to steal about $30,000 in city campaign matching funds and state grant money for personal expenses.A jury found Mr. Wills guilty of one count of a scheme to defraud, two counts of grand larceny in the third degree, and two counts of filing a false instrument in the first degree.

A new Republican president and a Republican Senate and House put everything they had into a bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and couldn\u2019t do it. The leadership is rocked. The president looks confused and hapless, while publicly enacting determination and a scolding tone toward those who\u2019d let him down. He rarely showed signs of fully understanding the details or even the essentials of the plan he backed. His public remarks were all over the place: He\u2019ll let ObamaCare collapse of its own weight; he\u2019ll replace it with something big and beautiful; just repeal it; no, let it collapse. He criticized Hill Republicans: They \u201cnever discuss how good their healthcare bill is.\u201d But neither did he, not in a persuasive way.Republicans on the Hill need a popular president with the quasi-mystical clout presidential popularity brings. Mr. Trump does not have it. They need someone who has a serious understanding of his own policies and can gently knock heads together. I remember the story of a GOP senator whose vote President Reagan badly needed. Reagan met with him privately, pressed hard, the senator squirmed: I just can\u2019t do it, Mr. President. You know I\u2019d jump out of a plane if you asked me, but\u2014Reagan leaned in and said: \u201cJump.\u201d The senator laughed and gave up. I\u2019m going to tell anecdotes like this until I feel better.It is true that a central dynamic of the failure was the truism that once people are given an entitlement, they aren\u2019t keen to see it taken away. But another reason some senators voted to repeal ObamaCare in the past and refused now is they believe the ground has shifted. Back in their home states, in the almost-decade since the economic crash of 2008, and since the Obama era, what they\u2019ve seen is more need, not less, more anxiety and dysfunction, and more public skepticism that change will constitute improvement. In politics you have to know how to read the ground, the real topography. You can\u2019t just go by the work of past mapmakers, you have to see clearly what\u2019s there now. It\u2019s unconservative not to.As for Mr. Trump, the first six months of his presidency suggest many things, including that what made him is thwarting him. He is a man alone, independent and ungoverned. He freelances not because circumstances dictate it but because he is by nature a freelancer. He doesn\u2019t want to be enmeshed in an institution, he doesn\u2019t want to have to bolster and defend it and see to its life. He wants to preserve his freedom\u2014to tweet, to pop off, to play it this way or that. One of the interesting things about his             New York Times                   interview this week was that he met with the reporters alone save for his aide Hope Hicks. Afterward members of his own White House reportedly had to scramble to get tapes so they\u2019d know what the boss said.But presidential leadership involves being to some degree an institution man, upholding not only a presidency but a government, even its other branches. He doesn\u2019t understand this. In any case he doesn\u2019t do it. It is all a personal drama. This aspect of his nature will probably make further legislative failures inevitable. In time, though no one in the White House seems to fear this, it will lead to his diminished support. His supporters will likely never hate him, and won\u2019t be severely disillusioned because they weren\u2019t all that illusioned. They\u2019ll probably always appreciate him for blasting open the system and saving them from normality\u2014i.e., the dumb, going-through-the-motions cynicism of Washington. They are sympathetic because of everything he is up against\u2014every established power center in Washington\u2014with no one behind him but his original supporters.But at some point baseline political competence is going to become part of the story. If the president continues to show he doesn\u2019t have the toolbox for this job, he\u2019s going to go from not gaining support, which is where he is now, to losing support. He\u2019s not magic and they\u2019re not stupid.As for health care, Sen.       John McCain,        recovering from surgery, had it right: \u201cOne of the major problems with Obamacare was that it was written on a strict party-line basis and driven through Congress without a single Republican vote,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a statement. \u201cAs this law continues to crumble in Arizona and states across the country, we must not repeat the original mistakes that led to Obamacare\u2019s failure.\u201d Congress, he said, must return to regular order, hold hearings, work across party lines, \u201cand heed the recommendations of our nation\u2019s governors.\u201dMr. Trump should have done this from the beginning.Is there any legitimate hope of a bipartisan solution? It can be fairly argued, as Jim Geraghty does in National Review, that a Democratic Party that relentlessly lied to pass ObamaCare\u2014you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor, premiums will go down\u2014is unlikely to consider conservative reform ideas in good faith. Democrats will press to keep individual and employer mandates and the status quo on Medicaid; they\u2019ll want billions in higher subsidies to get insurers back into failing exchanges. Some will want more money to offset larger-than-expected claims for insurance companies in the state and federal marketplaces, some will want single-payer. Mr. Geraghty: \u201cConservatives who oppose government mandates, subsidies, bailout and state-run health care won\u2019t like any of that.\u201dThey won\u2019t.And yet no fix or improvement in health care is going to be broadly accepted unless it comes from both parties. No reform will be accepted unless it\u2019s produced in a way that includes public hearings in which representatives make the case and explain it all. And any fix, because of America\u2019s current political nature, will be temporary. Democratic presidential hopefuls will be campaigning two years from now on single-payer, whatever happens with this bill.And health care in battered, anxious America will continue to play against Republicans.Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, beats the drum for the bipartisan approach. His logic: The ACA is wobbly; if nothing is done \u201cprices will get outrageous and people will revolt and rebel.\u201d\u201cWhy inflict this much pain?\u201d he says in a telephone interview. \u201cThe elderly, the vulnerable\u2014you\u2019re scaring the bejesus out of them.\u201d The Republicans, he says, have tried everything else. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down and work with us?\u201d He too asks for regular order.Yes, he says, some Democrats see this as an opportunity to go for single-payer, but that would be \u201ca big change\u201d: \u201cIf you want to talk about that, do a working group.\u201d For now, Mr. Manchin says, both parties should focus on Medicare, Medicaid, the private market, pre-existing conditions\u2014issues on which quick or clear progress can be made. He notes that the Senate has 11 members who are former governors. As executive branch veterans with on-the-ground experience, they\u2019ve learned what works and what doesn\u2019t. They\u2019re mostly moderate, not extreme. Get them in on this, he urges. \u201cWe still have some reasonable people here,\u201d he says. \u201cSome are just a little too quiet.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-obamacare-and-the-art-of-the-fail-1500592022", "keywords": ["political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:07:00", "news_title": "The Dumbing Down of \u2018Dunkirk\u2019", "content": "On May 28, 1940,       Winston Churchill       held a meeting of his government\u2019s ministers. \u201cI described the course of events and showed them plainly where we were, and all that was in the balance,\u201d Churchill later wrote. \u201cThen I said quite casually\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.: \u2018Of course, whatever happens at Dunkirk, we shall fight on.\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. I was sure that every Minister was ready to be killed quite soon, and have all his family and possessions destroyed, rather than give in. .\u00a0.\u00a0. There was a white glow, overpowering, sublime, which ran through our island from end to end.\u201d\u201cDunkirk,\u201d opening in theaters Friday, is noteworthy in many respects. Not least for its creator\u2019s decision\u2014on the interesting ground that it would make things clearer for audiences\u2014to avoid any appearance of Churchill. Of, that is, the newly appointed prime minister central to this story: the voice of that embattled Britain whose citizens, answering their government\u2019s call, set out to rescue its army, stranded on the beaches of northern France in May of 1940.Director       Christopher Nolan,        whose credits include \u201cBatman Begins\u201d and \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d has said he wanted to avoid making a film \u201cnot relevant to today\u2019s audiences\u201d and that he didn\u2019t want to get them bogged down in \u201cpolitics.\u201dThis says more than Mr. Nolan intended about his estimate of today\u2019s moviegoers\u2014whose capacities, he fears, would not be equal to a film involving images of a historic figure. There were other worries. Mr. Nolan didn\u2019t want to make a film that could be seen as old-fashioned, he informed his interviewer. It appears further that the director wanted to avoid taxing today\u2019s film audiences with any specifics about the foe that had the British Expeditionary Force fighting for its life on those beaches.\u201cWe don\u2019t have generals in rooms pushing things around on maps,\u201d Mr. Nolan explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t see Churchill. We barely glimpse the enemy.\u201d All true. Though there are quite a number of enemy planes, bombers smashing the troops on the beach. The bare glimpse Mr. Nolan mentions is of the insignia identifying the nation to which those planes belong. Who could it be?On the other hand, the markings on the British fighters engaging the enemy in dogfights loom large and clear. As do the reasons for all of the above. For, as Mr. Nolan has told us, he considers Dunkirk \u201ca universal story .\u00a0.\u00a0. about communal heroism.\u201d Which explains why this is\u2014despite its impressive cinematography, its moving portrait of suffering troops and their rescuers\u2014a Dunkirk flattened out, disconnected from the spirit of its time, from any sense even of the particular mighty enemy with which England was at war.When an event in history has become, in the mind of a writer, \u201cuniversal\u201d it\u2019s a tip-off\u2014the warning bell that we\u2019re about to lose most of the important facts of that history, and that the story-telling will be a special kind\u2014a sort that obscures all specifics that run counter to the noble vision of the universalist.No wonder those German Stukas and Heinkels bombarding the British can barely be identified as such. Then there is Mr. Nolan\u2019s avoidance of Churchill lest audiences get bogged down in \u201cpolitics\u201d\u2014a strange term for Churchill\u2019s concerns during those dark days of May 1940. One so much less attractive, in its hint of the ignoble and the corrupt, than \u201ccommunal\u201d and \u201cuniversal\u201d\u2014words throbbing with goodness. Nothing old-fashioned about them either, especially \u201cuniversal\u201d\u2014a model of socio-babble for all occasions.The certainty of the Nazis\u2019 threat is what preoccupied Churchill. His testament to the sterling attitude of his ministers, quoted above, kindly omits mention of the protracted arguments from those in his war cabinet who pressed for some respectable accommodation with       Hitler,        for some effort at least to open talks.There was, for Churchill, no acceptable accommodation with Hitler. He knew the disastrous impact on British morale of any word of talks or arrangements with the Nazis. They would instead hear from their new prime minister only the iron determination to defeat the enemy, the confidence that it would be done\u2014which had not a little to do with the strengthened spirit of the British public. They had been asked to fight for victory at all costs, and most knew why they must\u2014among them those pilots of small boats braving German fire to rescue the army.The film\u2019s aim, as its director says, is to tell a universal story of individuals struggling for survival. A struggle for survival under terrifying assault is exactly what we see through most of the action. Left out of this saga is any other sense of the importance of Operation Dynamo, the unexpectedly successful rescue of 338,000 soldiers who could, instead of being marched off to captivity by that barely visible enemy\u2014call it Nation X\u2014return to an England desperate for manpower.Continuing the fight was, to this England facing invasion, everything. To leave out of this story, in addition to Churchill, any sense of England\u2019s peril or the might of its enemy is to drain much of the life out of history.All this falls into the category of facts, irrelevant history, that Mr. Nolan would consider wrong for today\u2019s audiences. To the very end no image of Churchill defiles the sanctity of this film\u2019s safe space. One of the final scenes does present an exhausted evacuee returned from Dunkirk, reading aloud to himself from a newspaper of Churchill\u2019s most famous address, of June 4, 1940. The \u201cWe shall never surrender\u201d speech is spoken by a young soldier, making it all reassuringly relevant\u2014no trace of the man himself.It\u2019s possible of course that a director less apprehensive about appearing old-fashioned might have risked an actual clip of the prime minister without undue harm to the audience.In the bleak days of 1940, Churchill told his cabinet: \u201cIf this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each of us lies choking on his own blood on the ground.\u201d If Batman ever said anything remotely as interesting, he\u2019d have our devoted attention.Ms. Rabinowitz       is a member of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board.Appeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dumbing-down-of-dunkirk-1500592065", "keywords": ["dunkirk,hisorical film,war film,world war ii,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 19:00:00", "news_title": "\u2018Neutrality\u2019 for Thee, but Not for Google, Facebook and Amazon", "content": "Google,             Facebook                   and dozens of major internet companies joined forces last week for a \u201cDay of Action\u201d to rally support for \u201cnet neutrality.\u201d That\u2019s the idea that everything on the internet\u2014email, e-commerce transactions, cat videos and so forth\u2014must travel at the same speed and under the same conditions. This latest stir-up comes as the Federal Communications Commission is moving to overturn large parts of the Obama administration\u2019s 2015 net-neutrality policy.Both sides, including broadband providers, agree that no one should selectively block websites or chop the internet into fast and slow lanes. But lost in the debate is that companies like Google and Amazon, which cry out in favor of a neutral web, are virtual monopolies built on the same practice of prioritizing that they publicly decry.Since the birth of broadband, net neutrality\u2019s cheerleaders have feared that service providers might begin to act as the internet\u2019s \u201cgatekeepers,\u201d undermining its inherent free-for-all character. But cyberspace\u2019s dirty secret is that the gatekeepers aren\u2019t the broadband providers lampooned by the likes of       John Oliver.       The real distortions come from massive \u201cplatform monopolies\u201d like Google, Facebook and Amazon, whose proprietary algorithms decide what users see online.The supposed purpose of \u201cnet neutrality\u201d is to stop any internet company from getting a leg up over others. But that\u2019s exactly what happens when Google\u2019s search results prioritize its own services\u2014and profits\u2014over competitors\u2019. This skewing of results has \u201cstifled competition on the merits,\u201d according to the European Commission, which fined Google $3 billion last month for the practice. If Google\u2019s favoring its own products while pushing potential competitors down its rankings doesn\u2019t create \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d lanes, what on earth does?Similarly, avowed net-neutrality supporter Amazon was granted a patent in May for \u201cPhysical Store Online Shopping Control,\u201d a system to block shoppers in brick-and-mortar stores from using Wi-Fi to view competitors\u2019 prices. Isn\u2019t \u201cno blocking\u201d the heart of net neutrality? Facebook, meanwhile, has virtually abandoned chronology in its News Feed in favor of picking and choosing what users see\u2014and what they don\u2019t\u2014based on what the company has learned about them.The costs of such abuses from the platform monopolies are obvious and many. Newspapers have nearly been \u201cprioritized\u201d out of existence by Google\u2019s shameless appropriation of their work: Why click through and read a whole article when Google News will pluck out the most important bits and show them to you free\u2014alongside its own ads, of course. Music could be next, since Google\u2019s YouTube service serves up pirated digital streams that       leach       money from artists and record companies. Last year, the FCC chairman tried and failed to force TV companies to make their feeds available on set-top devices made by\u2014wait for it\u2014Google, Apple and Amazon.The internet giants behind the Day of Action can now track users\u2019 physical location 24 hours a day, learning where they live and work, by logging where their phones are at different times of day or the Wi-Fi networks they pass. If two phones sit side by side overnight, advertisers knows what that means\u2014and appropriately \u201ctargeted\u201d pitches are sure to follow.Whether it\u2019s just a massive blind spot or neck-snapping hypocrisy, a net-neutrality campaign led by companies that manipulate how Americans experience the web in these ways is an Orwellian embarrassment.The implications are frightening. Today, online news stories are so narrowly targeted that defining events\u2014this generation\u2019s Selma, Vietnam or Watergate\u2014might be seen only by a small slice of users prepared to believe them. Whatever role \u201cfake news\u201d played in the 2016 election, it will be merely the tip of the iceberg if secret algorithms are allowed to continue shaping America\u2019s information reality.But for the internet giants there is enormous money at stake. Facebook and Google alone already earn more from advertising than every newspaper, magazine and radio station in the world combined.Unlike the internet service providers, who have a limited share of any market, the platform giants are close to completing actual monopolies. Google now controls nearly 80% of the global market for web search, and 88% of the world\u2019s smartphones run on its data-mining Android operating system. Amazon\u2019s \u201ceverything store\u201d was a quasi-monopoly, accounting for nearly a third of total U.S. retail growth in 2016, even before its acquisition of             Whole Foods.America needs a fair and open internet ecosystem. Allowing Google, Facebook and the like to prioritize, discriminate and mine users\u2019 data at will threatens democracy and makes the internet neither open nor free.

Not long after the legislation was enacted, eligibility was expanded to include those experiencing psychological suffering or dementia. Today pressure is mounting for the Dutch government to legalize a \u201ceuthanasia pill\u201d for those who are not ill, but simply consider their lives to be \u201cfull.\u201dProponents of assisted suicide continue to claim that safeguards already built into Dutch law are sufficient to reduce the risk of abuse. They point out that medical professionals are required to assess whether a person\u2019s suffering is indeed unbearable and hopeless.These safeguards do exist. In practice, however, they are hard to enforce. A poignant illustration was recently aired on Dutch television. An older woman stricken with semantic dementia had lost her ability to use words to convey meaning. \u201cUpsy-daisy, let\u2019s go,\u201d she said. Both her husband and her physician at the end-of-life clinic interpreted her words to mean, \u201cI want to die.\u201d A review committee judged her euthanasia was in accordance both with the law and her earlier written instructions, an outcome very few would have imagined possible as recently as 10 years ago.Such episodes have many Dutch people worried about the erosion of protections for the socially vulnerable and medically fragile. A broad and heated public debate recently flared about whether doctors may administer fatal drugs to those with severe dementia based on a previously signed \u201cadvance directive.\u201d In several controversial cases, assisted suicide was not directly discussed with patients who were incapable of reaffirming earlier written death wishes. In one case, a doctor slipped a dementia patient a sleeping pill in some apple sauce so that he could be easily taken home and given a deadly injection.Hundreds of Dutch physicians signed a declaration outlining their moral objection to these increasingly common practices. Nonetheless, the Dutch government stands by its claim that the law permits doctors to end such patients\u2019 lives. Meanwhile, the Dutch Right to Die Society, a national euthanasia lobby, keeps pressing to take further steps, arguing that individuals should have the option to \u201cstep out of life.\u201dBut is this argument really convincing? Those seeking death because their lives are \u201cfull\u201d are often haunted by loneliness and despair. Some elderly people fear bothering their children with their social and medical needs. They don\u2019t want to be perceived as burdensome.Legalizing the euthanasia pill could put even more pressure on the vulnerable, disabled and elderly. More than 60% of geriatric-care specialists already say they have felt pressure from patients\u2019 family members to euthanize elderly relatives. Will the day come when society considers it entirely normal\u2014even \u201cnatural\u201d\u2014for people who grow old or become sick simply to pop the pill and disappear? If so, those who desire to continue living in spite of society\u2019s expectations will have some serious explaining to do.All of this clearly shows the slippery slope of the euthanasia path. Contrary to the emphatic advice of a special advisory committee chaired by a prominent member of a liberal-democratic party, the outgoing Dutch government wishes to expand and extend the euthanasia law to those who consider their lives to be full. The pressing question is where the slope ends and the abyss begins. Will those with intellectual disabilities or physical defects also be \u201cempowered\u201d to step out of life? Will those battling thoughts of suicide be encouraged to opt for a \u201cdignified death\u201d in place of excellent psychiatric care?The government\u2019s most fundamental task is to protect its citizens. The Dutch government, to its credit, often speaks out when fundamental human rights are under threat around the world. Now that the fundamental right to life is under threat in the Netherlands, it\u2019s time for others to speak out about the Dutch culture of euthanasia.Mr. van der Staaij is a member of the Dutch Parliament.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-the-netherlands-the-doctor-will-kill-you-now-1500591571", "keywords": ["dutch,euthanasia,netherlands,pro life,right to die,right to life,political,general news,society,community,dementia,ethical issues,health,medical conditions,mental disorders,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 18:59:00", "news_title": "Notable & Quotable: Peeling the Onion", "content": "From a July 6 blog post by       Cynthia Weber,        a professor of international relations at the University of Sussex:The US satirical website The Onion recently ran a fake testimonial video featuring a remorseful       Donald Trump       supporter.

V 0.86%       raised its financial targets for the year as its quarterly results beat Wall Street expectations, driven by a higher number of transactions.Profit surged to $2.06 billion, or 86 cents a Class A share, from $412 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier when results were hurt by charges related to the acquisition of its European operations. Net operating revenue rose 26% to $4.57 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected profit of 81 cents a share on $4.36 billion in net operating revenue.Visa shares, which have been trading at all-time highs, rose 1.2% to $99.37 after hours.Operating expenses rose by 31% after adjustments, largely tied to the Visa Europe acquisition that the company completed in June 2016.San Francisco-based Visa has delivered a string of earnings beats fueled by a growing credit-card market. Payments volume for the quarter rose 38% from a year earlier on a constant-dollar basis to $1.9 trillion, while total processed transactions rose 44% to 28.5 billion.Visa is the network for many in-demand credit cards, including the J.P. Morgan Chase Sapphire Reserve card, and has also benefited from             Costco Wholesale Corp.       cards\u2019 switch to the Visa network from             American Express.       Visa processes credit- and debit-card transactions and makes most of its money from transaction-related fees.The company is also benefiting from the global economic recovery, said       Vasant Prabhu,        Visa\u2019s chief financial officer, on the company\u2019s earnings call. Visa\u2019s cross-border volume, which is when cardholders use Visa cards outside of the country they are issued in, increased 11% on a constant dollar basis from a year prior when Europe is included in last year\u2019s results.Visa is also trying to make inroads in China. Chief Executive       Al Kelly       provided updates on the company\u2019s long-running effort to enter the Chinese market. Mr. Kelly said on the earnings call that the company filed an application on Wednesday with the People\u2019s Bank of China for a domestic license. The company has been trying to get more of its cards to be issued by Chinese banks to consumers for use inside the country.The U.S. and Chinese governments reached an agreement in May that is supposed to result in more access to the Chinese economy for electronic-payments providers. That reignited hopes that Visa and             Mastercard                   may get more market share in China.With one quarter to go, Visa again raised financial targets for the current business year, saying it now expects adjusted profit to increase about 20%, compared with its earlier view of an increase at the high end of the midteens. It also expects net revenue to increase about 20%, up from its previous view of an increase at the high end of 16% to 18%.On the earnings call, Mr. Kelly reiterated the company\u2019s commitment to get more customers to stop using cash\u2014a key piece of Visa\u2019s growth strategy. The company last week announced an initiative that offers up to 50 restaurants and food vendors in the U.S. $10,000 apiece to pay for technology upgrades and marketing costs if they agree to stop accepting cash from customers.Visa accounted for 59% of purchase volume on U.S. general purpose credit and debit cards last year, compared with Mastercard\u2019s 25% market share, according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication.Write to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com and AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Visa Lifts Financial Targets.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/visa-raises-outlook-as-results-beat-views-1500582767", "keywords": ["Visa,V,Visa Europe,Costco Wholesale,COST,Vasant Prabhu,Al Kelly,financial performance,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,credit types,services,debit cards,credit cards,banking,credit,financial services,plastic cards"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 18:47:00", "news_title": "IMF Board Approves Greece\u2019s Latest Bailout \u2018In Principle\u2019", "content": "A new cap on debt in the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest Greek bailout approved Thursday\u00a0keeps pressure on Europe to deliver debt relief and prevents Athens from raising fresh cash in the markets anytime soon.The IMF\u2019s board backed a $1.8 billion bailout for Greece, but only \u201cin principle,\u201d since it still considers the country\u2019s debt is \u201cunsustainable\u201d without significant relief by Athens\u2019s European creditors.The ceiling on the amount of debt Greece can hold\u2014detailed in documents prepared well ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting and signed by the Greek government\u2014gives Athens and Europe little room to wiggle out of commitments they made to overhaul the economy and restructure the country\u2019s debt.Greece\u2019s IMF bailout sets a debt-stock ceiling for the central government at around \u20ac325 billion ($374 billion),\u00a0accounting for the country\u2019s current debt and the bailout funds it receives from its European creditors.While Greece could go back to the markets to manage its debt\u2014swapping out old bonds for new bonds at better terms, if they can get them, for example\u2014the cap would prevent new bond issuance to build up a cash buffer, as Athens had been considering.According to earlier versions of the technical documents prepared in April, the ceiling of \u20ac325 billion was initially imposed on the general government debt, giving Greece an extra space of around \u20ac10 billion.It appears the consequences of the cap weren\u2019t noticed when the papers were initially signed. Officials familiar with the matter say that both sides have now committed themselves and the terms can now not be altered.The fund\u2019s parameters force Greece to focus on implementing reforms agreed under the bailout, rather than adding more debt stock to its huge pile, according to people familiar with the matter. But it is also setting more pressure to the Europeans to deliver more debt relief to Greece.\u201cThis is about the IMF wanting to keep political pressure on Germany to deliver debt relief,\u201d said       Rahman Mujtaba,       \u00a0Eurasia\u2019s Group managing director overseeing Europe. \u201cThat would be harder to achieve if Greece was able to successfully tap capital markets and raise fresh money in the coming days.\u201dGreece\u2019s European creditors and the IMF have been at odds since the beginning of the country\u2019s third bailout program about how much debt relief Europe should offer Athens and when.The two sides reached a compromise last month when the Europeans agreed to some limited debt-relief measures that will be implemented after the bailout ends.The IMF agreed to back a new program \u201cin principle,\u201d but said it would disburse financing only once Europe agreed to a clear debt-relief plan.The IMF had stayed out of the bailout for more than three years after Athens failed to deliver on promised overhauls and Europe put off debt-relief commitments.Despite the lack of a clear debt solution, the conclusion of the bailout negotiations created a positive momentum on the Greek economy. The country\u2019s borrowing costs have dropped significantly,             Moody\u2019s                   rating agency upgraded the economy and the European Commission suggested that the European Union should end disciplinary procedure against Greece as its public finances have improved.The Greek government wanted to tap the private markets to start creating a cash buffer, which could be used after the end of its bailout in August 2018 to meet its financing needs. Athens also hoped it would send a signal of confidence that the program works, despite the lack of clarity on debt and the IMF\u2019s half-in-half-out position.Athens has been shut out of international bond markets since 2010, except for a brief window in 2014. The government was considering tapping the markets at the beginning of the week, a decision called off temporarily when the hurdle that the IMF set became clear, according to officials. The issuance was going to be covered through swaps, but also aimed to raise some fresh cash.\u201cThis IMF program would be infringed if the government has issued a new bond, that would raise more cash,\u201d one person familiar with the matter said. Like any major breaches of the bailout terms, that would allow fund staff to go to the board and recommend putting the program on hold. And that in turn could create problems for Europe\u2019s bailout program because politicians there promised voters their emergency financing is contingent on IMF involvement.Despite the hurdle, the Greek government is planning to tap the markets in the coming days with an issuance that will be mainly covered through swaps of a bond that expires in 2019.Write to Nektaria Stamouli at nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-board-set-to-approve-greeces-latest-bailout-1500560342", "keywords": ["eu,greece bailout,imf,International Monetary Fund,regulation,government policy,government aid,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government borrowing,euro zone,currency,economic news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 18:45:00", "news_title": "Skate Shop Operators-Turned-Vodka Distillers Help Pernod Ricard\u2019s Local Effort", "content": "One of the biggest liquor companies in the world plans to begin distilling vodka in Manhattan in October.OUR/Vodka, a unit of             Pernod Ricard,       is building a distillery in Chelsea that will sell a wheat-based vodka.There are 21 distilleries currently operating in New York City, with 18 in Brooklyn, two in the Bronx, and one in Queens, according to the New York State Liquor Authority.\u00a0OUR/Vodka\u2019s OUR/New York operation would be the only one in Manhattan.The majority of ingredients will be sourced from New York state farms, the New York partners said. That will allow the business to operate lawfully with a farm distillery license, which requires\u00a075% of ingredients to be sourced from the state.License holders are allowed to distill up to 75,000 gallons of spirits a year, host on-site tastings, sell at farmers\u2019 markets, and open off-site locations.OUR/Vodka has spent years arranging everything, including signing up a couple of New York entrepreneurs to run the distillery.\u00a0The saga began in October 2013, when the phone rang at Dave\u2019s Wear House, a skate shop on Baxter Street in lower Manhattan. The caller\u00a0identified himself as a talent scout for a spirits company.\u201cWe thought the guy wanted us to design a T-shirt. Maybe we\u2019d get a few free bottles,\u201d said       Kevin Carney,        47 years old, co-owner of the Skate Shop, along with       Dave Ortiz,        47, a former\u00a0graffiti\u00a0artist.The scout visited their shop the following day and introduced himself as       Thurman Wise,        but he didn\u2019t\u00a0reveal\u00a0that he was working on behalf of OUR/Vodka.\u00a0Mr. Carney suggested he hire them to throw a party. Mr. Wise, 32, agreed to consider it and offered that maybe they could also run the distillery.\u201cOur friends are really into elaborate practical jokes and this guy had\u00a0hair down to his shoulders. His arms, hands and neck are covered in tattoos. He wore patent leather loafers with no socks. We thought we were getting punked, but we went with it,\u201d said Mr. Ortiz.Mr. Wise said his employers were visiting from Sweden the following day and told Messrs. Carney and Ortiz they would meet\u00a0      Asa Caap,        chief executive of OUR/Vodka. At the time, the company\u2019s vodka was being distilled and sold locally in\u00a0Berlin. It has since rolled out to\u00a0London, Amsterdam, Los Angeles and Detroit.\u201cI was told to recruit guys to open and run a distillery in New York City and they\u2019d get a piece of the business, but they needed to be authentic New Yorkers and creative problem solvers who were literally willing to carry 36 cases of vodka,\u201d Mr. Wise said.Mr. Wise said he had a tough time locating operators for the new distillery.\u00a0At the outset, the project was so scrappy that he was using a Gmail account, and his emails were being ignored. In New York alone, 10 to 12 people failed to reply to him before he found Messrs.

He was 41.Coroner spokesman       Brian Elias       said authorities are investigating Mr. Bennington\u2019s death as an apparent suicide at Palos Verdes Estates, but no additional details are available.Band co-founder and producer Mike Shinoda said on Twitter he was \u201cshocked and saddened.\u201dThe Grammy Award-winning group sold more than 10 million copies of their 2000 debut, \u201cHybrid Theory,\u201d which featured the megahit and anthem, \u201cIn the End.\u201d They sold 6 million more copies of 2003\u2019s multiplatinum \u201cMeteora.\u201d Both albums explored feelings of frustration and fury.The success helped Linkin Park become Billboard\u2019s No. 1 act of the decade for rock songs and alternative songs.Mr. Bennington\u2019s voice could soar with piercing strength or descend to a whisper. Rolling Stone once called it a \u201cshrapnel-laced howl that sounds like it comes from someone twice his size.\u201dThe band also sold millions with its remix album, \u201cReanimation,\u201d and its mashup record with Jay Z, \u201cCollision Course.\u201d They won Grammys for best hard-rock performance in 2001 for \u201cCrawling\u201d and best rap/sung collaboration for \u201cNumb/Encore\u201d in 2005. Linkin Park was on tour and was next scheduled to perform next week in Massachusetts and New York.Mr. Bennington struggled with drug and alcohol addictions at various times during his life. He said he had been sexually abused as a child and was homeless for months before the band found fame.Linkin Park released their most recent album, \u201cOne More Light,\u201d in May. It was a CD that divided critics and fans alike for its embrace of moody pop. One song on the album, \u201cHeavy,\u201d opens with the words: \u201cI don\u2019t like my mind right now.\u201dAlthough the band had always experimented with different sounds, some claimed Linkin Park had sold out, which Mr. Bennington denied. \u201cOne More Light\u201d became the band\u2019s fifth No. 1 album debut on the Billboard 200.\u201cIf you like the music, fantastic. If you don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s your opinion too. Fantastic. If you\u2019re saying we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing for a commercial or monetary reason, trying to make success out of some formula. then stab yourself in the face!\u201d Mr. Bennington told NME magazine.Mr. Bennington was close friends with Chris Cornell, who died by hanging earlier this year, and performed Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah\u201d at the Soundgarden singer\u2019s memorial in late May. He was the godfather of Mr. Cornell\u2019s 11-year-old son, Chris. Mr. Cornell\u2019s 53rd birthday would have been Thursday.\u201cThe Cornell family is overwhelmed by the heartbreaking news about Chester Bennington which tragically comes so soon after their family\u2019s own loss,\u201d said a Cornell family spokesperson. \u201cThey open up their loving arms to Chester\u2019s family and share in the sorrow with all those who loved him.\u201dWhen he got his big break in 1999, Mr. Bennington was an assistant at a digital-services firm in Phoenix. A music executive sent him a demo from the band Xero, which needed a lead singer. Mr. Bennington wrote and recorded new vocals over the band\u2019s playing and sent the results back. He soon got the gig, and the band then changed its named to Hybrid Theory, then Linkin Park.Mr. Bennington was married to his second wife, Talinda, and is survived by six children.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/linkin-park-singer-chester-bennington-found-dead-1500578756", "keywords": ["chester bennington death,chester bennington suicide,linkin park death,linkin park suicide,musician suicide,Chester Bennington,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,obituaries,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 18:32:00", "news_title": "Fed\u2019s Task Force to Release Proposals to Improve Electronic Money Transfers ", "content": "A Federal Reserve-sponsored\u00a0task force is preparing to unveil proposals\u00a0by financial institutions, payments providers, trade groups and others to improve\u00a0the decades-old U.S. systems for moving money electronically.The faster payments task force, which is set to publish a summary report of the work on Friday, rated 16 proposals that met or exceeded predetermined criteria for speed and security, developed in consultation with the central bank, according to a copy viewed Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.The task force includes more than 300 representatives taken from federal agencies, banks, consumer groups, technology firms and merchants such as             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       and Lyft Inc. Consulting firm McKinsey & Company helped assess the proposals, which come from industry groups such as The Clearing House, a payments operator owned by U.S. banks that is working with             International Business Machines Corp.       and             Mastercard\u2019s       VocaLink, and the Independent Community Bankers of America as well as payments software startups Dwolla Inc., nanoPay Corp. and Ripple.The report caps a two-year effort to identify safer and speedier ways to transfer money digitally\u00a0between bank accounts. The new approaches, many of which are designed to settle transfers in real time, could allow companies to collect funds or pay employees instantaneously and save money by bypassing intermediaries.Already, debit cards using networks operated by             Visa Inc.       and Mastercard Inc. offer instant transfer options. And a group of the biggest banks recently expanded a network, Zelle, for instant transfers between consumers. But many of the older payment systems remain much slower.\u201cOur goal is to ensure that anyone, anywhere, is able to pay and be paid quickly and securely,\u201d said       Sean Rodriguez,        the Fed\u2019s faster payments strategy leader and chair of the task force. \u201cIn real terms, that means people will not have to wait hours or days to deliver and access their money.\u201dWhile the current system is viewed as both reliable and universal, this process aims to spur the U.S. to keep pace with similar upgrades to domestic payments systems in such countries as Australia and the U.K.\u201cInnovators have built new systems and services that ride on top of the old rails but with mixed results, and over time our system has grown more fragmented,\u201d said Fed governor       Jerome Powell       in a March speech.The Fed doesn\u2019t have the legal power to mandate changes to the U.S. payment system. Its interest in the matter stems from its regulation of big banks, as well as its operation of parts of the existing system, such as Fedwire, a same-day funds transfer service for banks and businesses, and check clearing.The Fed has said the task force didn\u2019t set out to pick winners and losers and that the central bank wasn\u2019t endorsing any one provider.\u201cThe next step will be, OK, you\u2019ve these 16 pieces, now how do we tie them together?\u201d said Cary Whaley, first vice president at Independent Community Bankers of America.Industry and task force participants\u00a0hope the new report will serve as a sort of starting gun for the adoption of newer systems. It could encourage a shift away from\u00a0some used today by banks, including one called the Automated Clearing House, or ACH.\u00a0The ACH network handles more than $40 trillion of direct deposits, bill payments and other transfers each year,\u00a0and traces its roots to the 1970s.Janet Estep,        chief executive of ACH administrator NACHA and a member of the task force\u2019s steering committee, said ACH has some \u201ccore competencies that are hard to duplicate\u201d and added that it introduced some same-day settlements last year.\u201cAll electronic payments today are focused on the same goal: taking cash and checks out of the payments ecosystem,\" she added.A side benefit of the task force\u2019s work could be the development of systems better protected from cyberattacks, and with more granular data, enabling businesses and bill payers to embed invoices and other detailed information in electronic transfers.Faster transfers could also help companies pay so-called \u201cgig\u201d workers instantly, and reduce the need for underbanked consumers, those without bank accounts or credit, to seek expensive payday loans while waiting for their paychecks to clear.\u201cFaster payments can help ensure increased control over cash flow, better money management, and decreased reliance on short-term credit,\u201d said       Christina Tetreault,        a staff attorney with Consumers Union and a task force steering committee member.It remains to be seen how any new system will evolve, and whether any of the proposals would be widely adopted,\u00a0or how costly it could be to do so.The 16 proposals were drawn from 19 that had been received as of January.Write to Katy Burne at katy.burne@wsj.com and Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-task-force-to-release-proposals-to-improve-electronic-money-transfers-1500583399", "keywords": ["electronic money transfers,International Business Machines,IBM,Independent Community Bankers of America,McKinsey,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,Lyft,economic news,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,etailing,shopping malls,superstores,banking,central banking,computer services,management consulting,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services,credit,business consultancy,e-commerce,financial services,online service providers,technology,sharing economy services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 18:19:00", "news_title": "Free Online Course Materials Help Take Textbooks off N.Y. Students\u2019 Shoulders", "content": "The City University of New York predicts that ditching more textbooks in favor of free online materials will save 50,000 students more than $4.5 million this coming year in book fees.Like many schools nationwide in recent years, CUNY and the State University of New York have started replacing some required textbooks with free digital options. That effort got a boost in April when the state allotted $4 million to each institution to speed up the change.So-called open educational resources can be downloaded, edited and shared under an intellectual-property license that allows their use at no cost. Such materials are \u201coutstanding tools,\u201d said       Marc Cohen,        the 22-year-old president of the Student Assembly at SUNY. He applauded the shift as \u201clife-changing,\u201d saying every student has been forced to buy an \u201cinsanely expensive textbook\u201d at some point. One organic chemistry tome, for example, costs $364.While supporters of free materials say they give teachers more leeway to be creative, skeptics caution that some resources lack quality or coherence and adapting them can be time-consuming.At CUNY, where almost half of the student body comes from households earning less than $20,000, officials said the cost of a student\u2019s books can total as much as $1,200 a year. The officials said faculty members were converting 350 popular courses to free digital materials for the fall and were being trained on their use. These resources will be shared publicly.The infusion of funding for this project is \u201ca real shot in the arm for efforts to make college attendance even more affordable,\u201d said CUNY Chancellor       James Milliken.       He said the course catalog will show which classes have no textbook fees, and, in a year or two, some CUNY degrees won\u2019t require such fees.Eleven of SUNY\u2019s 64 campuses have reported enrollment information so far, and at those 11 schools, officials projected that 12,000 students will be taking at least one course using open educational resources this fall. Overall, SUNY estimates its students will save around $8 million on textbooks by June 2018.Jean Amaral, a librarian at CUNY\u2019s Borough of Manhattan Community College, said courses converting to open educational resources this fall include psychology, English literature and public speaking.In surveys, students at her campus reported that digital materials saved them from lugging heavy backpacks and were more quickly accessible than printed books they had to order. Some students said they could study on cellphones on the subway. One student said saving money on books allowed the purchase of a MetroCard.Ms. Amaral said some teachers were excited about the chance to tap more engaging and interactive materials, including audio and video. \u201cTextbooks are incredibly dry,\u201d the librarian said.Write to Leslie Brody at leslie.brody@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/free-online-course-materials-may-help-take-textbooks-off-cuny-students-shoulders-1500589194", "keywords": ["college costs,college textbook costs,college textbooks,cuny,cuny system,online textbooks,organic chemistry,suny,suny system,political,general news,education,university,college"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 18:14:00", "news_title": "Tens of Thousands of Minks Released From Minnesota Farm Face Grim Future ", "content": "Tens of thousands of minks\u2014valued at about $750,000\u2014were released by vandals from a Minnesota fur farm earlier this week and are at risk of death even as they wreak havoc on surrounding wildlife and farms.The incident highlights the longtime clash between animal rights groups and the more than $100 million domestic fur industry, which has seen prices collapse in recent years.Stearns County Sheriff       Don Gudmundson       said a group of \u201cnitwits\u201d dismantled three sections of corrugated steel fencing at Lang Farms near Eden Valley late Sunday night or early Monday morning, turning loose the entirety of the facility\u2019s mink population. The 30,000-40,000 freed animals, mostly jet-black and some blond-colored, are roughly 17 inches long and weigh three pounds.Mr. Gudmundson believes the culprits are misguided activists who don\u2019t realize the harm they have caused to the animals they intended to liberate.\u201cThey certainly don\u2019t care about animals because thousands of animals are maybe already dead and certainly will die,\u201d Mr. Gudmundson said.Alleged activists orchestrated a similar release of a few thousand minks at a neighboring ranch in Stearns County in 1998, he said, and there has been a drop in the cost of furs from mink farms across rural America as a result of other acts of protest in recent years.Katie Arndt,        outreach coordinator for Minnesota\u2019s Animal Rights Coalition, said she wasn\u2019t sure whether she supported releasing the minks, as the small carnivores will threaten the ecosystem and eventually die in the wild.\u201cThis is one of these situations where you want to say, \u2018Yay, they\u2019re free!\u2019 But are they really?\u201d she said.\u201cWhen the law does so little to protect minks and other animals from a horrifying life of misery on fur farms, it\u2019s not hard to understand why some people are compelled to take matters into their own hands and free animals from this kind of grotesque confinement,\u201d PETA President       Ingrid Newkirk       said in a statement.But Mr. Gudmundson said the domesticated animals don\u2019t know how to survive outside the farm, without regular access to water in 90-degree weather. They also cannot handle the extraordinary stress brought on by natural events such as thunderstorms.Of the 6,000-7,000 minks that have been recaptured, at least 5,500 perished shortly after recovery.The freed animals also threaten other species in a nearby wildlife preserve.\u201cThey\u2019re domesticated, but they have wild in them,\u201d Mr. Gudmundson said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go in there and kill everything that moves: the baby ducks, the baby geese, all the chipmunks.\u201dMr. Gudmundson said the minks are aggressive animals with \u201cvicious bites\u201d that carry the threat of rabies. At least one local farmer has already called the sheriff\u2019s office to report that 10 of his chickens were killed since the minks invaded the community.The minks have also been known to bite humans.Fur Commission USA, a mink farming national trade association, is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the perpetrators\u2019 arrest and conviction. According to the organization, more than 85% of pelts in the global fur trade are farmed. The other 15% are trapped in the wild.American mink farms produced 3.32 million pelts last year valued at $116 million, according to the Department of Agriculture.Wisconsin, which produced more than one-third of those pelts, leads the nation in mink farming. Neighboring Minnesota, which produced more than 204,000 pelts in 2016, is also among the top five states in terms of production.\u201cThe upper Midwest has always been kind of the center of the industry,\u201d said       Michael Whelan,        Fur Commission USA\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to the state and the local economies, in the rural areas especially.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   More than 85% of minks globally are produced on farms.

Expectations that the central bank is moving closer to reducing its bond-buying program had sent the euro up nearly 10% this year before the meeting.In a press conference, ECB President       Mario Draghi       said the central bank hasn\u2019t discussed the future of the program yet but plans to do so in the fall.Many analysts interpreted Mr. Draghi\u2019s tone as cautious, reducing the likelihood that the central bank will announce plans to taper stimulus in September as some had expected. Still, the euro rallied as Mr. Draghi \u201csidestepped a good opportunity to talk down the euro,\u201d said analysts at TD Securities in a research note.The euro was also bolstered by a slide in the U.S. dollar after a Bloomberg report that the investigation into ties between President       Donald Trump\u2019s       campaign and Russia in last year\u2019s election are extending to Trump\u2019s businesses.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, fell 0.3% to 86.73, its lowest closing value since October.Brad Bechtel, a currency strategist at Jefferies Group, said the report \u201cjust increases the uncertainty\u201d surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s agenda, which was expected to bolster U.S. growth and the dollar.The dollar was hit earlier in the week by the Republican failure to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities since taking office.The Japanese yen was steady after the Bank of Japan also held policy steady but lowered its inflation forecasts. While central banks from Europe to Canada move closer to withdrawing stimulus, the BOJ is likely to maintain its ultra loose monetary policy as inflation remains low.

Creditors have been suing Puerto Rico since early last year over an escalating series of debt defaults, but never before has a group targeted Uncle Sam directly for damages.Plaintiffs including Glendon Capital Management LP and             Oaktree Capital Management                   LP are facing possible losses on bonds issued in 2008 to prop up Puerto Rico\u2019s struggling pension fund. Their lawsuit, filed Wednesday, blames the federal oversight board that was installed by Congress to dig the island economy out from its $73 billion debt load. The seven-member board placed Puerto Rico\u2019s largest public retirement fund under bankruptcy protection in May to restructure those $3 billion in pension bonds.\u201cBecause the oversight board is so clearly a part of the federal government, its actions are themselves the actions of the United States,\u201d the complaint says.Preventing a taxpayer bailout for Puerto Rico\u2019s financial woes was a priority for House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (Wis.) and congressional Republicans who designed Puerto Rico\u2019s rescue package. That law, known by its acronym Promesa, \u201cisn\u2019t a bailout,\u201d according to a statement from Mr. Ryan\u2019s office last year. \u201cIt preserved that critical principle of protecting taxpayers.\u201dA spokesman for the oversight board didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Promesa empowered the oversight board to write down Puerto Rico\u2019s massive pile of municipal debt consensually through negotiated deals, or through court-supervised proceedings if negotiations failed. After a decadelong recession punctuated by high unemployment and poverty rates, the U.S. territory is desperate to stem the migration of its residents to the U.S. mainland.Like many municipal governments, Puerto Rico has long struggled to keep its pension systems healthy. Proceeds from the pension bonds were supposed to help the Puerto Rico Government Employees Retirement System continue paying benefits until elderly pensioners died off and younger public employees began retiring with less-generous benefit packages. Instead, the value of the system\u2019s investments cratered during the financial crisis, bringing the pension system to the brink of insolvency today.The bonds are payable from the pension contributions paid by public employers toward their workers\u2019 retirements. Bondholders thought they would be paid first, but the oversight board last month adopted legislation to move the contributions outside the pension system and beyond creditors\u2019 grasp.The plaintiffs asked for a court order declaring that maneuver an illegal taking of private property under the U.S. Constitution, as well as \u201ccompensation equal to payment of the principal amount of the [Employees Retirement System] bonds.\u201dCreditors were optimistic the oversight board would quickly approve consensual settlements and avoid prolonged bankruptcy proceedings, but now that hope is dwindling. Deals to restructure the island\u2019s general obligation bonds and its electric utility debt have met the board\u2019s veto, despite prodding from congressional Republicans to honor restructuring deals negotiated with local officials.Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-ricos-bondholders-file-first-suit-against-uncle-sam-1500587205", "keywords": ["puerto rico debt,Oaktree Capital Management,OAK,U.S. government,Glendon Capital Management,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,municipal debt,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,portfolio,fund,asset management,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,pension funds,public pension funds"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 17:17:00", "news_title": "Jeff Sessions Says He Plans to Continue as Attorney General", "content": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Thursday he has no plans to leave the Justice Department and will \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d pursue the Trump administration\u2019s priorities, a response to President Donald Trump\u2019s comment in a recent interview that he regretted appointing Mr. Sessions.\u201cThe work we are doing today is the kind of work that we intend to continue,\u201d Mr. Sessions said at a previously scheduled press conference at the Justice Department. \u201cI\u2019m totally confident that we can continue to run this office in an effective way,\u201d he said.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.The comments came after Mr. Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday that he wouldn\u2019t have appointed Mr. Sessions to his job if he had known he would remove himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.In the extensive interview, Mr. Trump also criticized the deputy attorney general who took Mr. Sessions\u2019 place overseeing the investigation,       Rod Rosenstein      ; the special counsel appointed to run the probe,       Robert Mueller      ; and former Federal Bureau of Investigation director       James Comey,        whom Mr. Trump has said he fired in part over the Russia investigation.Mr. Sessions, an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump, deflected the criticism. He said he was honored to serve as attorney general and the position was \u201cbeyond any thought I would have ever had for myself.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe love this job, we love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate.\u201dMr. Sessions was at the White House as recently as Wednesday, for a National Security Council meeting, according to White House spokesman       Sean Spicer.On Thursday, White House spokeswoman       Sarah Sanders       told reporters that Mr. Trump was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself earlier this year but that he didn\u2019t regret keeping him in the role. The two haven\u2019t spoken in the last 24 hours, she said.\u201cClearly he has confidence in him or he would not be the attorney general,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.At the news conference, scheduled to announce a major takedown of the largest online marketplace for illicit goods, AlphaBay, Mr. Sessions was asked only about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, fielding no questions about the case. Aides ended the gathering after they solicited, but didn\u2019t receive, any questions on the AlphaBay operation.Mr. Sessions pointed to the AlphaBay case and a health-care fraud takedown announced last week, as well as a gathering with state and local law-enforcement officials on Wednesday, as evidence the agency was continuing to enforce administration priorities in combating transnational crime and spikes in drug use and violent crime.\u201cI\u2019m totally confident that we can continue to run this office in an effective way,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.In the interview with the Times, Mr. Trump said, \u201cSessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\u201dSome prominent Republicans had called on Mr. Sessions to recuse himself, including Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) and Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), as well as many Democrats. Legal ethics experts said that because Mr. Sessions had played a key role in the Trump campaign, it could raise questions if he oversaw an investigation that examined, among other things, whether that campaign coordinated with Russia.On Thursday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), who had been a vocal proponent of appointing a special counsel, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the interview. \u201cWhat we\u2019re watching is an obstruction of justice case unfolding in real time right before our eyes,\u201d said Mr. Blumenthal, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee.In the Times interview, Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Mueller for alleged conflicts of interest; said Mr. Comey had provided congressional testimony \u201cloaded up with lies\u201d; and questioned Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s neutrality since he was from Baltimore, a city Mr. Trump said had \u201cvery few Republicans.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment, and Mr. Comey declined to comment through an associate. At the news conference, Mr. Rosenstein said he was working to \u201cadvance\u201d the administration\u2019s priorities.\u201cI was proud to be here yesterday, I\u2019m proud to be here today, I\u2019ll be proud to be here tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said.Mr. Trump aimed much of his frustration in the interview at Mr. Sessions, a former Alabama senator who endorsed Mr. Trump early in the campaign, when few Republicans were getting behind their eventual nominee. Mr. Trump described the attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation as \u201cextremely unfair\u2026to the president.\u201dHe also blamed Mr. Sessions for \u201cbad answers\u201d to Congress that set him down a path that led to his recusal. In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions said he hadn\u2019t had \u201ccommunications with the Russians\u201d even though he had met with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S.,       Sergey Kislyak.\u201cJeff Sessions gave some bad answers\u2026He gave some answers that were simple questions and should have been simple answers, but they weren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The recusal came one day after reports of those discrepancies emerged.

The buyer declined to be identified. The pre-sale estimate was $2 million to $4 million.The artifact from the Apollo 11 mission had been misidentified and sold at an online government auction, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had fought to get it back. But in December a federal judge ruled that it legally belonged to a Chicago-area woman who bought it in 2015 for $995.Sotheby\u2019s declined to identify the seller. However, details of the 2015 purchase were made public during the court case.Investigators found the 12-by-8\u00bd-inch bag while searching the garage of a man later convicted of stealing and selling museum artifacts, including some that were on loan from NASA.Nancy Lee Carlson, of Inverness, Ill., bought the ordinary-looking bag made of white Beta cloth and polyester with rubberized nylon and a brass zipper from an online government auction.Ms. Carlson, a collector, knew the bag had been used in a space flight, but she didn\u2019t know which one. She sent it to NASA for testing, and the government agency, discovering its importance, fought to keep it.U.S. District Judge       J.

Last quarter marked the first time since late 2010 that this earning group\u2019s gains outpaced all others, including the 90th, 75th, 50th and 25th percentiles.Rising minimum wages in many states is one factor.Usual weekly earnings for workers ages 25 and older at the bottom of the pay scale rose 3.4% from a year earlier in the second quarter, according to analysis of newly released Labor Department data. That was stronger than the median gain of 3.2% and the 3.1% improvement for workers at the 90th percentile, who earn more than nine in 10 other Americans. The percentage increases are based on a four-quarter average of earnings, to smooth out volatility in the data.Throughout much of the economic expansion that began in mid-2009, wage gains for the lowest-earning Americans trailed behind median wage gains and those of the highest earners. The annual raise for the lowest earners was below 1% annually during 2015, less than half as strong as the median gain.The recent improvement for low earners coincides with a downward trend in the U.S. unemployment rate, which stood at 4.4% last month, versus 4.9% a year earlier. The unemployment rate for those with less than a high-school education\u2014who make up much of the low-wage workforce\u2014fell even more sharply, to 6.4% last month from 7.5% a year earlier. Tighter labor supply in theory should push up wages.Wages have been rising swiftly in fields such as restaurants, amusements and gambling, said       Jed Kolko,        economist at job-search site Indeed. That is an indication that employers need to pay more to attract workers into those fields.\u201cIn a strengthened economy, people spend more on entertainment and eating out, raising demand for workers in those fields,\u201d he said. Those wage gains also at least partially reflect rising minimum wages, which have increased in 21 states this year.Usual weekly earnings is a different wage measure than the more broadly cited average hourly earnings figure reported in the jobs report each month. The quarterly figure incorporates overtime pay, commissions and tips that might not be captured in the hourly figure.Average hourly earnings have been stuck near a 2.5% annual increase for most of the past year and a half. But the jobs report shows stronger wage growth in the lowest-paying broad sector tracked, hospitality.Average earnings\u2019 failure to rise even while many Americans doing better reflects a slowdown at the top.\u201cThe slowdown has been particularly sharp within the top 5%,\u201d             Goldman Sachs                   economists wrote in a research note Thursday. \u201cOne possibility is that some high-wage individuals could be delaying the recording of earnings, given the possibility of a future income tax cut.\u201dStill, higher-earning Americans have fared much better during the expansion. Pay for workers in the 90th percentile has increased nearly 20% since mid-2009. Pay for the 10th percentile worker rose 12.5%, not enough to offset inflation.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see wage pressure at the two ends\u2014the high-skilled end and the low-skilled end,\u201d Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said in an interview this month. \u201cWhere the squeeze is still happening is the middle-skill jobs.\u201dHe said that could partially reflect new technologies emerging to supplant better-paid workers. For example, he said, sophisticated document-reading software is reducing law firms\u2019 need for armies of young associates to do the task.Since the recession ended, employment in legal services rose less than 1%. Employment at restaurants and bars is up 24%.Last year, the Wireless Zone, a chain of cellphone stores, raised base pay for workers at its company-owned locations to about $18 an hour, but cut back the bonus incentives it offered. As a result, the lowest-paid workers earn more, shrinking the gap between high and low earners. Average pay is little changed, said       Dave Staszewski,        executive vice president of the Rocky Hill, Conn.-based franchise. He said the change in pay structure was designed to attract scarce workers.He said \u200bthe strategy has been effective in attracting workers as these job seekers put a bigger emphasis on guaranteed salary rather than potential bonuses.However, some low-paid workers say the raises are still too small to make a difference. LaShawnda Obie, a             Wendy\u2019s                   worker from Detroit, received a 40-cent increase to $8.90 an hour in January, when Michigan\u2019s minimum wage increased. That is a 4.7% raise\u2014but she said it isn\u2019t enough to support herself and two daughters.\u201cI still have to sacrifice,\u201d the 28-year-old said. \u201cMy kids need underwear and clothes, but I have to push that aside so I can pay rent.\u201dA Wendy\u2019s Co. spokeswoman said Thursday that wages for individual employees are set by the chain\u2019s franchise operators.In a May call with investors, Wendy\u2019s Chief Financial Officer       Gunther Plosch       said the company is \u201cpulling all levers that we can\u201d to overcome an expected 4% increase in labor costs this year.The chain aims to increase sales to offset rising costs and is \u201cinvesting in technology on the front end of the house behind mobile ordering and the rollout in kiosks\u201d to reduce the need workers, he said.Technology can make existing workers more productive, which often coincides with wage increases, but in the longer run it can also eliminate jobs.Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/low-income-earners-see-weekly-pay-gain-faster-than-other-groups-1500543003", "keywords": [" earnings,economy,labor market, low income, minimum wage, pay,wages,U.S. Labor Department,Dave Staszewski,Jed Kolko,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,workers pay,political,general news,general labor issues"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 16:40:00", "news_title": "McCain Warns \u2018Sparring Partners\u2019 in Senate He Will Soon Return to the Fray ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Sen.

Col.       Ali Mohammed Al Muhannadi,        the head of the investigation team at Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Interior, told reporters Thursday while presenting the results of an inquiry into the cyberattack.The allegation points to an escalation of tensions between the Gulf neighbors, complicating mediation efforts led by Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       to smooth over the rift between U.S. allies.A U.A.E. official didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusations.The U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt last month severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, citing its support for Islamists like the Muslim Brotherhood and its covert ties with terror groups like al Qaeda. The four countries issued a list of demands, which Doha rejected.Qatar has repeatedly denied backing extremists but maintains it has the right to pursue an independent foreign policy, such as by supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, which in 2013 was ousted from power in Egypt and then banned.On May 24, news stories appeared on Qatar\u2019s state-run media carrying incendiary comments attributed to Qatar\u2019s ruling emir,       Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani,        who was quoted as praising both Iran and Hamas. The remarks, which also appeared on social media accounts linked to the state-controlled news agency, were swiftly denied by Qatar\u2019s government, who said the sites had been hacked.Despite the denial, Qatar\u2019s Gulf neighbors responded by blocking access to Qatari media outlets including Al Jazeera, before severing ties with Doha a few weeks later.The Washington Post earlier this week reported that senior Emirati officials were behind the cyberattack on Qatar News Agency, citing U.S. intelligence officials.Emirati officials have vehemently denied that the U.A.E. had anything to do with the cyberattack. \u201cThe U.A.E. had no role whatsoever in the alleged hacking,\u201d Yousef Al Otaiba, the U.A.E.\u2019s ambassador in Washington, said in a statement.Presenting the results of its investigation into the incident on Thursday, Qatar\u2019s ministry of interior said it documented a spike in visits to the news agency\u2019s website from the U.A.E. during the cyberattack. It said Qatar\u2019s prosecutors are preparing to file a lawsuit against the perpetrators of the attack.\u2014Noam Raydan in Beirut and Asa Fitch in Dubai contributed to this article.Write to Margherita Stancati at margherita.stancati@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Qatar Ties Emirates To Hacking of Media.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-in-u-a-e-linked-to-cyberattack-in-qatar-that-helped-trigger-gulf-rift-1500581614", "keywords": ["Qatar's Ministry of Interior,political,general news,crime,legal action,cybercrime,hacking,politics,international relations,domestic politics,media,entertainment"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 16:08:00", "news_title": "New York City Swelters as Temperatures Top 90 Degrees ", "content": "New York\u2019s Central Park topped out at 94 degrees\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0to tie with\u00a0June 13\u00a0as the hottest day yet of 2017, according to the National Weather Service.A heat advisory remained in effect for most of the region Thursday, with New York Gov.

The latest fad for \u201cdata dependence\u201d makes one wonder.That phrase or its variants have appeared in a growing number of central bankers\u2019 statements about their activities. The idea is that their exit from their current round of ultralow interest rates and balance-sheet-ballooning bond purchases will be driven only by data, as opposed to ideology, political pressure, market turbulence or entrails.What data? Take your pick.In the eurozone it\u2019s wage growth. European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       has settled on this as an important indicator that the eurozone will have achieved \u201cstronger inflation dynamics,\u201d for which he said in his press conference Thursday that he\u2019s still waiting.In America, it\u2019s inflation. Federal Reserve policy makers \u201cwill adjust their assessment of the appropriate path\u201d for interest rates in a manner \u201cinformed by incoming data,\u201d       Janet Yellen       told Congress this month. In particular, the Fed \u201cwill be monitoring inflation developments closely in the months ahead\u201d as inflation falls further below the Fed\u2019s 2% target\u2014despite eight consecutive years of economic growth and obvious asset-price bubbles.In Britain, it\u2019s anything and everything. At times, Bank of England Governor       Mark Carney       has expressed a fixation on wage growth. More recently, he suggested he might wait to raise interest rates until he\u2019s seen whether exports and investment can compensate for falling consumer spending as drivers of growth.Given that technocrats at central banks are supposed to make data-driven decisions, their vigorous protests that they\u2019re doing so should make you suspicious. Sure enough, markets have figured out that \u201cdata-dependent\u201d is code for \u201cwe\u2019ll find some way to avoid normalizing policy at even a hint of a small cloud on the horizon.\u201dDon\u2019t fault the central bankers too much. They do it because they have to. The concept of central-bank independence is misleading. Monetary policy is inherently political, forcing trade-offs between young and old, savers and borrowers, importers and exporters, homeowners and renters, and the like.No one in his right mind would trust unelected economics professors to make those bargains on their own. Instead, independent central banks are supposed to implement a set of predetermined political trade-offs that elected politicians say they want but doubt they\u2019d have the courage to enact themselves. This is what policy mandates, which invariably imply a demand for central banks to do unpopular things such as burst bubbles, are all about.The problem is that amid demographic changes, unprecedented globalization, an economic transformation toward services\u2014and a failure of elected politicians to respond appropriately\u2014the old instructions central banks received no longer work. Inflation and economic growth no longer move in tandem, if they ever did, and ultralow interest rates have lost their stimulative power.Applying the old guidelines in these new conditions has become both economically and politically destructive. Absent outlets for economic growth in the productive economy, accommodative monetary policies skew asset prices and distort investment decisions. The inflation they manage to create hits unevenly, with the young and the poor especially poorly off owing to the basket of goods they\u2019re more likely to consume. Voters strike back by voting for Brexit,       Donald Trump,        Italy\u2019s 5-Star Movement and       Marine Le Pen       (almost).What\u2019s a central bank to do in the face of the contradictory economic signals for which it wasn\u2019t prepared by its elected patrons? The only thing it can do: Follow the old playbook slavishly while awaiting political events. \u201cData dependence\u201d is the rhetorical justification for what is essentially a political decision to lay low.Central bankers, like all of us, need a new political settlement that will lend some coherence to monetary policy. That might include a new determination to reform entitlements to accommodate new demographic realities, along with a commitment to policy reforms that would boost productivity and investment.This would free central banks of the burden of worrying about the implications of their interest rates and inflation for government debt service, and they would no longer be the default stimulators of growth.Surprisingly, the eurozone may lead the way. The reformist       Emmanuel Macron       got himself elected as France\u2019s president, and Germany\u2019s       Angela Merkel       may be headed to a center-right coalition with a reform-minded party after September\u2019s election there. It\u2019s possible that France and Germany revive growth enough that Berlin can re-apply its traditional hawkish pressures on the ECB.Elsewhere, not so much. Washington\u2019s health-care meltdown and Britain\u2019s election fiasco reveal politicians and electorates profoundly confused about how best to achieve a fiscally sustainable entitlement state and sufficiently widespread economic opportunities in light of new realities.Until the politicians figure something out, independent central banks will remain heavily dependent on their data for lack of any broader political consensus to lean on.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-banks-fall-into-a-data-trap-1500580928", "keywords": [" central bank, european central bank, federal reserve, interest rates, janet yellen, mario draghi, mark carney,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 16:01:00", "news_title": "Europe\u2019s Struggle to Take Its Destiny Into Its Own Hands", "content": "In the Bavarian beer tent, the unnamed target was instantly identified as       Donald Trump       when Chancellor       Angela Merkel       declared an end to those balmy days \u201cwhen we could rely completely on others.\u201d Now, \u201cwe Europeans must take our destiny into our own hands.\u201dOf course, Europe could and should. The Continent weighs in with 500 million people, with as many troops as the U.S., and a gross domestic product just shy of America\u2019s. So why has the European Union always punched below its weight? Because a group of nation-states, no matter how closely bound, do not a single strategic player make.But now they have Mr. Trump. So Mrs. Merkel and France\u2019s President       Emmanuel Macron       met in Paris last week to restart that fabled Franco-German \u201cmotor\u201d of European togetherness.Pronouncing a \u201crevolution,\u201d the two leaders want to build a fifth-generation fighter jet and a Eurodrone. They want to beef up projection forces by buying transport aircraft (never mind that those C-130 are Made in America). They want to collaborate on space-based surveillance.That\u2019s quite a list. Too bad the French also want to cut \u20ac850 million ($980 million) from their defense budget. Germany, meanwhile, shows no signs of raising its own defense spending to the promised 2% of GDP from its current 1.2%, and will have zero chance of doing so if September\u2019s elections force Mrs. Merkel into another coalition government with the butter-not-guns Social Democrats. Domestic politics always trumps strategic ambitions.Back to the cooing Franco-German couple. Hardly had Mrs. Merkel left when Mr. Trump, invited on short notice, arrived in Paris for Bastille Day, where he was feted with a pomp worthy of the Sun King.Mr. Macron extolled a \u201cfriendship across the ages\u201d\u2014ever since the French helped the Americans best Britain in the War of Independence. \u201cNothing will ever separate us,\u201d he told the U.S. president.Warm words, cold realpolitik. By embracing Mr. Trump, Mr. Macron aimed to score big. The U.S. has always relied on two \u201cspecial relationships\u201d in Europe, with Britain and Germany. But Brexit-bound London is about to lose leverage on the Continent, and Mrs. Merkel, leading a fervently anti-Trump country, has taken herself out of the running.Enter France, pushing into the vacuum, never mind Mr. Macron hugging Mrs. Merkel the day before. Six weeks prior, the French president had courted       Vladimir Putin       in the Palace of Versailles. These were textbook moves to make Paris the choice address in Europe. Thus do economy powers try to fly business.So who will take Europe\u2019s destiny in hand? By weight and strategic position, it should be Germany, especially because of its \u201cEurope \u00fcber alles\u201d convictions. But while Mrs. Merkel seems to agree with Mr. Macron on fiscal union, they don\u2019t mean the same thing. The French want a looser fiscal policy, and denounce the German approach as \u201causterity.\u201dAll of this ignores Germany\u2019s irreducible handicap. Germans still loathe the use of force. The twinship of war and diplomacy famously preached by Clausewitz has today become an alien concept in the country.In the past 70 years, Germans have convinced themselves that it is much more profitable to cultivate their own garden than to go abroad to slay monsters. France has at least some remnants of a warrior culture. It would take a lot more than Mr. Trump to undo Germany\u2019s cherished stance as Friedensmacht, a \u201cpower of peace.\u201dTo step up, Mrs. Merkel would address her nation thus: \u201cTo take Europe\u2019s destiny in our own hands, we must double our defense spending and triple our projection and fighting forces. Above all, the time has come to shed our aversion to strategic action\u2014not for the sake of the Fatherland, but of Europe.\u201d But she won\u2019t, because she knows her electorate.Now look beyond Berlin and Paris. Cohesion is waning. To the north, London is retracting into nonsplendid isolation. To the east, authoritarianism, laced with anti-Europeanism, is on a roll in Hungary and Poland. Nationalist populism has been rising from Naples to Narvik.So Europe will be what it has been: a dynamic but uninspiring enterprise. It will cautiously deepen economic integration. France and Germany will compromise here and deadlock there.The best news is that the eurozone is growing again, while France seems earnest about loosening the grip of statism. The populist revolt has been contained in France and Holland. Disarmament has turned into rearmament thanks to Mr. Putin.And Mr. Trump\u2019s America? The U.S. has been quietly moving troops and some 2,000 pieces of heavy equipment into Europe to deter Russia.

During a press conference, Mr. Draghi gave a nod to the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery, but signaled that inflation isn\u2019t showing convincing signs of picking up. The ECB chief added that policy makers haven\u2019t set a precise date on when to discuss policy changes.Bond investors took the remark as less hawkish than the one Mr. Draghi made last month that kick-started the recent selloff of government bonds in the developed world. Mr. Draghi on June 27 signaled that the central bank might start winding down its monetary stimulus as the eurozone economy picks up speed.\u201cThe hawkish Draghi view has turned into cautious ECB thesis,\u2019\u2019 said       Victor Xing,        founder and investment analyst at Kekselias Inc.The buying sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to as low as 2.239% during early Thursday morning, the lowest level since June 28. Yields fall as bond prices rise.The yield pared its decline in the afternoon session because of a bout of profit-taking. It settled at 2.266%, compared with 2.268% Wednesday.Bond yields have fallen after a recent rise. The 10-year yield nearly topped 2.4% on July 7 before turning lower. The shift bolsters some money managers\u2019 belief that without signs of accelerated inflation, it would be difficult for a rise in yields to have staying power.Major central banks are still struggling to push up inflation to their desired target, making it difficult for policy makers to dial back monetary stimulus even as the global economy has been showing broad improvement, said analysts.Demand for Thursday\u2019s 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities sank, a sign of reduced need to hedge the risk of higher inflation with U.S. data showing softening consumer prices during the past few months.The \u201cunsightly auction is pulling yields\u201d in both Treasurys and TIPS higher during the afternoon session, said       Jim Vogel,        an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial.The selling was heavier in TIPS, which pushed down the yield premium on the 10-year Treasury note relative to the 10-year TIPS by 0.04 percentage point to 1.74 percentage point. A shrinking premium signals reduced inflation expectations.The bond market shows \u201csharp skepticism in the ability of central banks to generate inflation,\u2019\u2019 said       Tony Crescenzi,        portfolio manager and market strategist at Pacific Investment Management Co.The Bank of Japan on Thursday kept its bond-buying program steady. One notable change is that the BoJ pushed back the date when it expects 2% inflation\u2014the sixth time it has been postponed under Governor       Haruhiko Kuroda.The central bank now sees the target being reached by March 2020, five years after Mr. Kuroda\u2019s initial timing.Large bond buying from both the ECB and the BOJ has played a big role in driving down government-bond yields in the developed world to historically very low levels. Analysts have warned that the value of government bonds would fall when these central banks reduce purchases.Some money managers said the central bank policy outlook is the main risk for bond investors and that the uncertainty is likely to generate price swings in the months ahead.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-government-bond-prices-strengthen-on-draghi-comments-1500560712", "keywords": ["european central bank,government bonds,mario draghi,tom di galoma,treasury bonds,treasury yields,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 15:38:00", "news_title": "Urban Farming Gets New York City Council Attention ", "content": "When Robert Laing was setting up his indoor herb-growing business in Manhattan last year, it took months to find someone willing to insure his tiny hydroponic operation.\u201cYou say, \u2018I\u2019m a farm,\u2019 and they put you over to their farming division and they say, \u2018How many acres do you have?\u2019 and you say, \u2018300 square feet,\u2019\u201d Mr. Laing said.New York City has the largest urban agriculture system in the country, including community and rooftop gardens and greenhouses, as well as \u201cvertical farms\u201d like Mr. Laing\u2019s company, Farm.One, which cultivates microgreens in windowless rooms aglow with LED lights. But a recent report by the Brooklyn Law School finds new growers are sometimes stymied by confusion over where they fit into city regulations.A new bill in New York City Council aims to change that. The measure, introduced Thursday by Councilman Rafael Espinal and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, and assigned to the Land Use Committee, calls for a comprehensive urban agriculture plan with updated zoning and building codes and possibly an office of urban agriculture.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about our mom and dad growing tomatoes in the backyard,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the potential of having major farming on rooftops to deal with food deserts.\u2026This is the wave of the future.\u201dNew York City has 14,000 acres of unused rooftop space that could feed millions of people if converted to gardens, said Mr. Adams.\u00a0But rooftop gardens are allowed only in nonresidential areas, and there are restrictions on where produce can be sold, he said.Current zoning codes only mention the word \u201cagriculture\u201d a handful of times and are essentially silent on hydroponic operations, according to the Brooklyn Law School report.Mr. Espinal said a comprehensive food plan could lift restrictions, clarify regulations, and coordinate city efforts to encourage agriculture. It would create jobs, improve access to fresh food and help fight climate change by reducing carbon footprints associated with food transport, he said. \u201cIt would be a win, win, win across the board for the entire city.\u201dCritics of urban farming point to higher prices associated with small-scale growing and energy-consuming hydroponic cultivation. Foods grown in these contexts aren\u2019t for everyone, said Henry Gordon-Smith, an urban agriculture consultant and vice-chair of the Association for Vertical Farming. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to get cheaper as we get bigger.\u201dMr. Laing, who supplies rare herbs to Michelin-starred restaurants in the city, said a better legal framework in the city would have helped him get insurance, by providing an official point of reference for confused insurers.Clearer regulations would also help growers attract investors, said John Rudikoff, head of the Center for Urban Business Entrepreneurship at Brooklyn Law School. \u201cVenture capital and investment banking are going to remain on the sidelines because there\u2019s no municipal assurance that these uses they might be investing in are permitted,\u201d he said.Mr. Rudikoff pointed to nearby Newark, which\u00a0revamped its zoning code to include specific language on urban agriculture and is now home\u00a0to\u00a0AeroFarms, one of the country\u2019s biggest indoor farming operations.\u201cThere\u2019s a barrier to entry here,\u201d said Jason Green, co-founder of Edenworks, a Bushwick aquaponic company that raised $3 million in outside investment in the past two years. He said his company has had a difficult time sorting through the various incentive programs available. \u201cIt\u2019s often up to the operators to work through a fragmented regulatory and incentive environment and figure out who you are accountable to.\u201dClarity around urban farming rules could benefit not only companies, but also nonprofits that use agriculture as a tool for teaching and community organizing. Teens for Food Justice currently has a hydroponic farm in a Brooklyn classroom, and has been working for over two and half years to install a second one in the Bronx. Kathy Soll, head of the organization, said a comprehensive city plan would speed up that process\u00a0by clearing up confusion she faces from school principals, custodians, and contractors unfamiliar with hydroponics.Paul Lightfoot, chief executive of greenhouse farm company BrightFarms, said he has looked into setting up shop in cities like New York, Chicago and Washington. \u201cIt is devilishly difficult and expensive and slow,\u201d he said.Instead, he\u2019s installed greenhouses right outside major cities, where he can get construction approval in weeks instead of months, and still be close enough to deliver to dozens of metro supermarkets.Mr. Lightfoot said a new comprehensive plan in New York City isn\u2019t likely to attract large-scale growers like BrightFarms, but it\u2019s still a good way to encourage smaller businesses that can supply to restaurants. \u201cBrooklyn is filled with artisanal everything and this is going to be that sort of stuff,\u201d he said.Corrections & Amplifications   Edenworks said it raised $3 million from outside investors in the past two years.

That, combined with increased Libyan oil production created a cap for oil prices, analysts said.But there are positive signs, too. U.S. oil inventories have now dropped in 13 of the last 15 weeks. And demand has improved since Memorial Day, analysts said.U.S. oil stockpiles fell by 4.7 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration had said Wednesday.

Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said in testimony last week that the U.S. central bank was looking \u201cvery carefully\u201d at recent weak inflation data.Still, Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments drove the euro to its highest level against the dollar in nearly two years. His bullish description of the eurozone economy appeared to bolster the narrative of an end to the ECB\u2019s support of bonds, a shift which would enhance the euro\u2019s appeal.Bond markets, on the other hand, were stable. Mr. Draghi highlighted low eurozone inflation and said the bank would act cautiously, suggesting that stimulus could remain in place through 2018 and possibly beyond.After years of easy-money policies, central banks in the U.K., Canada and the eurozone have all recently signaled they are preparing to follow the Fed by nudging interest rates higher. Some investors believed the ECB could move soon after Mr. Draghi recently hinted that the days of easy money might be numbered. The ECB\u2019s decision to stand pat surprised them.\u201cContrary to what we too had expected, the ECB has not taken any step towards normalizing its monetary policy at today\u2019s meeting,\u201d said Ralph Solveen, an economist with             Commerzbank                   in Frankfurt.Privately, though, ECB officials have long indicated that the bank might signal the future of the program at a policy meeting on Sept. 7. Mr. Draghi is due to speak at the Fed\u2019s economic conference in Jackson Hole in late August, which could give the ECB chief an opportunity to signal a policy shift.The ECB\u2019s \u20ac60 billion ($69 billion)-a-month bond-buying program has helped drive down market interest rates as the eurozone recovers from a yearslong economic crisis. Its future is one of the biggest questions hanging over financial markets. Asset prices, borrowing costs and the value of the euro currency will all be impacted by its withdrawal.But ECB officials face a dilemma: While the eurozone economy is accelerating, inflation, at 1.3% last month, remains some way below their near-2% target.Mr. Draghi rocked financial markets last month in Sintra, Portugal, by suggesting that the ECB might soon wind down its bond-buying program as the region\u2019s economy accelerates.Top ECB officials have since called for caution, wary of triggering a sharp rise in borrowing costs that could upset the region\u2019s economic recovery.Mr. Draghi didn\u2019t backtrack from his comments, which triggered a sharp jump in Eurozone bond yields and helped push the euro to its highest level against the dollar in more than a year.Indeed, the ECB chief suggested that officials are comfortable with recent market movements. \u201cLong term yields have risen but are still low by historic standards and\u2026bank rates continue to be at very supportive levels,\u201d he said.Only the recent strength of the euro was something that \u201creceived attention\u201d from ECB officials, Mr. Draghi said. A stronger euro hurts the region\u2019s large exporters and could put downward pressure on growth and inflation.\u201cDraghi\u2019s overarching message was similar to his Sintra speech,\u201d said Peter Schaffrik, an economist with             Royal Bank of Canada                   in London. \u201cThe euro area was finally experiencing a strong recovery and the Governing Council needed to be patient.\u201dThe ECB chief offered little in the way of new information to investors, except to say that officials had agreed to take up the discussion on the bond-buying program \u201cin the fall.\u201d That could include the ECB\u2019s next policy meeting on Sept. 7, he suggested, when the ECB will have fresh economic forecasts for the euro area.\u201cThe ECB is not ready to commit to any timescale on tapering, or on its announcement,\u201d said Greg Fuzesi, an analyst with JPMorgan in London. \u201cClearly, the ECB needs more time to discuss the outlook.\u201dMichael Steen, a spokesman for Mr. Draghi, reinforced the possibility of a September policy move by tweeting a link to a definition of \u201cmeteorological autumn,\u201d which begins on Sept. 1. The astronomical season begins only on Sept. 22.The ECB\u2019s decision Thursday is likely to aggravate officials in Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, who are growing restless at the flow of easy money from Frankfurt. They worry that years of ultralow interest rates have subsidized southern European governments and hurt German savers and pensioners.Clemens Fuest,        president of German economic institute Ifo, urged the ECB to set out a plan for halting bond buying in January. \u201cWithout a clearly communicated program for phasing out expansionary monetary policy, pressure on the ECB to keep up the flood of liquidity will only grow,\u201d Mr. Fuest said.Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'ECB Signals Wariness on Low Inflation.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-reiterates-commitment-to-bond-buying-program-1500551922", "keywords": [" ecb bond buying program,ecb interest rates, ecb quantative easing, ecb tapering,European Central Bank,Mario Draghi,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 15:26:00", "news_title": "Elon Musk Teases a New York-to-D.C.

Amtrak\u2019s Acela Express travels between New York and Washington in slightly less than three hours.He didn\u2019t immediately say which government agency or official had given approval, or elaborate on issues such as timing or cost, but later added he aimed to build similar systems in suburban Los Angeles and Texas. Infrastructure projects of large sizes often take years\u2014if not decades\u2014to receive government approvals.\u201cStill a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote.A spokesman for Mr. Musk\u2019s tunnel venture, the Boring Co., said in a written statement that the company has had \u201cpromising conversations\u201d with local, state and federal government officials, without disclosing names. He added that the company expects to receive formal government approvals to \u201cbreak ground\u201d later this year.The Transportation Department referred questions about the hyperloop to the White House, which confirmed conversations with Mr. Musk and other Boring Co. executives. But the White House didn\u2019t say whether it had provided any kind of approval for the hyperloop.A White House spokesman said in a written statement: \u201cWe have had promising conversations to date, are committed to transformative infrastructure projects, and believe our greatest solutions have often come from the ingenuity and drive of the private sector.\u201dA spokesman for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that the announcement was \u201cnews to City Hall.\u201dMr. Musk\u2019s tweets raised more questions than they answered.Depending on the route, such a project could require approvals from five or six state governments, said Lynne Kiesling, associate director of Purdue University\u2019s Research Center in Economics. Ms. Kiesling\u2019s research includes the effect of regulatory institutions on technological change.\u201cStringing together five or six such approvals would be a long, costly and fractious process,\u201d she said.Mr. Musk has long talked about the creation of a so-called hyperloop, a system for high-speed transportation in a near-vacuum state that takes place in miles-long tubes. Since Mr. Musk floated the idea in 2013, others have tried to commercialize the concept. Hyperloop One has raised $180 million but has faced delays in rolling out a prototype.Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets convey his wide-ranging interests. He is chief executive of electric-car maker             Tesla Inc.,       which last year merged with energy company SolarCity, another business he backed. Mr. Musk also leads the rocket maker Space Exploration Technologies Corp.In April, Mr. Musk announced plans for a new company called Neuralink Corp., where he also is CEO, aiming to merge computers with brains so humans could one day engage in \u201cconsensual telepathy.\u201dIn his series of tweets Thursday, Mr. Musk said the hyperloop system, a network linking New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, would be accessible from city centers, with as many as a dozen access points in each city.Mr. Musk responded to few of the questions posed to him on Twitter. \u201cSupport would be much appreciated!\u201d Mr. Musk said in one tweet.He began teasing the idea of a tunnel project on Twitter in December, with a post saying, \u201cTraffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear, however, if the musing was more than just a man bored with Los Angeles traffic.In January he tweeted: \u201cExciting progress on the tunnel front.\u201d \u201cPlan to start digging in a month or so,\u201d he said.He has been testing his tunneling techniques at SpaceX in Hawthorne, Calif.Just days ago, at a gathering of U.S. governors, Mr. Musk answered a question about whether he feels pressure from people\u2019s expectations about his projects, particularly in light of Tesla\u2019s stock price, which has soared more than 50% this year.\u201cI find it quite tough when there are very high expectations,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cI try to actually tamp down those expectations.\u201d\u2014Eliot Brown  contributed to this article.Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Elon Musk\u2019s New Tunnel Vision.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/musk-teases-a-new-york-to-d-c-hyperloop-in-a-tweet-1500571308", "keywords": ["acela,amtrak,elon musk,high-speed rail,hyperloop,tech news,technology news,tesla,transportation news,Boring,Elon Musk,corporate,industrial news,disruptive innovation,political,general news,transport,heavy construction,tunnel construction,construction,real estate,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 15:24:00", "news_title": "Gas Everywhere but No Way to Ship It   ", "content": "Accidents happen, but these were expensive ones by any measure.Energy Transfer Partners had hoped to have the first phase of its massive Rover pipeline up and running by now, transporting natural gas from America\u2019s most prolific natural gas basins to other parts of the country.Rushing to complete construction in a tight regulatory window, the company allegedly spilled drilling fluid into a protected wetland and then demolished a historic house adjacent to the pipeline. Federal investigations into both have likely delayed startup possibly until the fall for a project to take gas extracted in Marcellus and Utica shale regions in Appalachia.That is bad not only for ETP but several large energy producers selling gas at a steep discount to national benchmark gas price. The August futures contract for the difference between a local hub in Pennsylvania and the main U.S. futures price doubled to $1.30 a million British thermal units between early May and late June, a 40% discount.Multiplied by tens of billions of cubic feet a day, that is real money for the likes of             Southwestern Energy,EQT Corp      , Range Resources,             Chevron                   and             Cabot Oil & Gas.That is just a temporary setback in a region where drilling is expanding far quicker than transport. There is $20 billion in planned pipeline projects in the region according to analysts at Citigroup, yet even that may not be enough to absorb the boom in production. The two basins produce four times the gas coming from the Permian Basin in the Southwestern U.S. that attracts far more attention because of its oil output.Before the shale boom, the Northeastern U.S. and the Midwest had plenty of pipeline capacity, but it carried gas north from places like Texas and Louisiana. Now the Northeast has too much gas and needs to ship it to the Midwest\u2019s heating and industrial customers. Eventually the old trading flows should reverse so gas goes south to the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s massive petrochemical facilities and export hubs.This race to build may run into more misfortune, though. Cheap northeastern gas still will have a hard time competing with growing volumes of \u201cassociated\u201d production coming out of the oil patch closer to the Gulf of Mexico that will be sold at any price.Watch out for unexpected slips and falls.Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gas-everywhere-but-no-way-to-ship-it-1500578675", "keywords": ["energy transfer partners ,natural gas,rover pipeline ,Energy Transfer Partners,ETP,commodity,financial market news,energy,machinery,industrial goods,oil,natural gas midstream operations"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 15:23:00", "news_title": "Ex-NFL Star O.J. Simpson Granted Parole", "content": "Nevada officials Thursday granted parole to       O.J. Simpson,        agreeing to release the 70-year-old former football star from prison as early as October.Mr. Simpson, whose 1995 murder trial was recently revived through a popular television series and documentary, has been serving nine years for the armed robbery of sports memorabilia from a Las Vegas hotel room. He was acquitted on the murder charges.Mr. Simpson bowed his head and looked relieved as four members of the state parole board each voted in favor of his release.Coverage of Mr. Simpson\u2019s hearing streamed live over the internet and TV feeds, harkening back to his murder trial that riveted the nation.Mr. Simpson came up for parole after serving the minimum time on an up-to-33-year sentence stemming from his 2008 conviction on charges including kidnapping, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon.\u201cI am sorry things turned out the way they did,\u201d Mr. Simpson told the four-member board Thursday, recounting his discipline-free stay in prison and how he has become a more devout Christian who has counseled other inmates to help them stay out of trouble.The more than hourlong hearing at times veered into a rehashing of the original crime, as Mr. Simpson told the board in detail what happened on the 2007 day when he and several accomplices, some armed, stormed a Las Vegas hotel room.\u201cIt was a serious crime and there was no excuse for it,\u201d parole board commissioner Tony Corda said before voting for his release. \u201cYou deserved to be sent to prison.\u201d Mr. Corda said that Mr. Simpson had complied with prison rules and was at low risk of re-offending.Mr. Simpson expressed remorse Thursday for bringing along men that day to serve as armed security, but said he only went to the room to take back memorabilia and personal photos that he said belonged to him.\u201cI am no danger to pull a gun on anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my property, I wasn\u2019t there to steal from anybody,\u201d he later added.In his 1995 trial, Mr. Simpson was accused of killing his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend,       Ronald Goldman.       Mr. Simpson was famously acquitted in that criminal trial, but his reputation as a National Football League hero and actor never fully recovered.The parole board said Thursday that while it received many letters opposing Mr. Simpson\u2019s release because of the 1995 acquittal, they wouldn\u2019t consider that in this case.Hundreds of members of the media flocked to Nevada to watch the proceeding, which took place in Carson City, with Mr. Simpson appearing via videoconference from the medium security prison in Lovelock, northeast of Reno.Board member       Susan Jackson       pressed Mr. Simpson on why he didn\u2019t attend Alcoholics Anonymous, something he told the board in 2013 that he would do. Mr. Simpson said that while alcohol was involved in the crime, it was because he was at a wedding that day and that he has never had a problem with drugs or alcohol.Mr. Simpson appeared with his lawyer,       Malcolm LaVergne,        looking trimmer than at his parole hearing in 2013. Parole board chairman       Connie Bisbee       told him at the outset: \u201cYou are getting the same hearing that everyone else gets.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve done my time,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. \u201cDone it as well and as respectfully as I think anyone can.\u201cI\u2019ve basically spent a conflict-free life,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. He said he has had problems with fidelity, but was \u201calways a guy that pretty much got along with everybody.\u201dThe Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners, which heard more than 9,000 cases last year, said ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing that Mr. Simpson\u2019s case has been \u201ca disruption to our operation.\u201dMr. Simpson\u2019s daughter,       Arnelle Simpson,        told the board how hard the past nine years have been for their family. \u201cI know that he is remorseful,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want him to come home so we can move forward for us, quietly.\u201dBruce Fromong,        one of the victims of the robbery, told the board that he thought Mr. Simpson was misguided that day but he believes he has served more than enough prison time. \u201cO.J. is my friend, always has been, and I hope will remain my friend,\u201d he said.Mr. Simpson said he plans to live in Florida if he is released.

Ted Cruz (R., Texas) that would allow for cheaper but more bare-bones insurance plans because that analysis requires more time.The new CBO analysis shows the bill wouldn\u2019t change the number of people without coverage compared with projections released in June on an earlier version of the GOP legislation.That earlier number spurred a revolt from some centrist GOP senators who said they couldn\u2019t support the bill because it caused too many people to lose coverage. In the new report, the deficit-reduction figure is about $100 billion more than the earlier reading.In Thursday\u2019s report, the CBO said the projected decline of 22 million people covered under the Senate bill includes a drop of 15 million people on Medicaid. In addition, the decline includes five million people who wouldn\u2019t have individual coverage, and two million who wouldn\u2019t have employment-based coverage, partly due to the removal of ACA requirements that individuals get coverage or pay a fine, and that most employers offer health plans.The incomplete analysis is likely to complicate a major push by President       Donald Trump       and Senate GOP leadership to revive the bill: Some lawmakers wavering in their support have said they want to see a full CBO analysis before making a final decision.Without a full analysis, lawmakers won\u2019t have comprehensive estimates on how the legislation would impact the federal deficit, premiums, or the number of people without coverage.The Senate plans a vote next week on a motion to proceed, which allows lawmakers to debate the legislation. That could take the form of a repeal plan with a delay to set up a new health system or another attempt to pass a broader overhaul soon.The analysis comes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is working to get the 50 votes needed to keep the health-care push alive. Several conservatives want to overturn more of the ACA while centrists are seeking to preserve certain parts of the law, including a higher level of Medicaid spending.The revised Senate bill retained steep cuts to Medicaid and phased out enhanced federal funding for the expansion in 31 states. But it does include other changes meant to ease the impact, including an additional $45 billion to combat the opioid epidemic and $70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance markets.To help fund the programs, the revamped bill also keeps a 3.8% tax on net investment income and a 0.9% Medicaid surtax\u2014changes some conservative Republicans strongly oppose.Mr. McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans, assuming no Democrats support the bill, in order for it to pass. Vice President       Mike Pence       would break any tie.That goal has also become harder because Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) has been recovering from surgery and said late Wednesday he has been diagnosed with a brain tumor. The timing of his return to the Senate depends on consultations with his medical team.The bill\u2019s $420 billion reduction to the federal deficit through 2026 compares with a $321 billion savings under the earlier Senate bill. The revised bill would lower the deficit by cutting Medicaid spending and subsidies to consumers who get coverage on the individual markets.In 2018, average premiums for a midprice plan would be about 20% higher than under the ACA, in large part because the bill ends the penalty for not having coverage. That would cause fewer healthy people to sign up, the CBO reported, leaving insurers with consumers who have costlier medical conditions that drive up costs.The average premiums would then drop about 30% in 2020 compared with the ACA, although plans would pay for a smaller share of health benefits and effects of premiums would vary across the country with higher costs for older people.A person buying a midtier plan under the legislation in 2026 would see a deductible of roughly $13,000 for medical and drug expenses combined, the report said. The CBO estimates these midtier plans would cover 58% of covered medical expenses. Many low-income people wouldn\u2019t purchase any plans, the CBO found.The revised bill includes the Cruz proposal would let insurers that sell plans that comply with ACA regulations also sell plans that don\u2019t. Opponents say the proposal would increase the number of uninsured by raising costs for people with pre-existing health conditions.Supporters say it would reduce premium costs and allow more people to buy insurance.House Republicans have passed a health bill that would result in 23 million fewer uninsured compared with the ACA, an earlier CBO report estimated.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cbo-says-revised-senate-plan-would-increase-uninsured-by-22-million-1500572177", "keywords": [" aca, affordable care act,cbo, health care, health law, republicans, senate,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 14:40:00", "news_title": "Here\u2019s What Kept Bank Stocks Down This Week", "content": "The five large U.S. banks with a major Wall Street presence beat analysts\u2019 earnings expectations over the past week, sometimes by a wide margin.Yet with one exception, the banks\u2019 shares all sold off in response to the results. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has dropped 2% since earnings season started last Friday, compared with a 1% gain in the S&P 500.Behind the disappointment: Bank stocks have run up significantly since the U.S. presidential election and found new momentum at the end of the second quarter, showing many investors already had priced in strong second-quarter results.It was hard to live up to the billing. Interest rates have been only a mixed blessing. Short-term rates going up since last fall helps lenders, while the 10-year Treasury yield declining hurts them.Then there is the Brexit hangover. Trading desks, especially in all-important fixed-income divisions, reported declines that shook the belief that trading had started a sustained rebound after years of slumping. Making matters worse: The year-ago period featured the U.K. Brexit vote, which led to a brief surge of activity and made this year\u2019s second quarter look tame by comparison.In some cases, the drivers for banks\u2019 earnings wins weren\u2019t the superstar divisions like trading, but rather utility\u00a0players unused to the limelight. This unlikely cast of heroes, from private equity to\u00a0asset management and commercial lending, provided some boosts, but they weren\u2019t enough to move the stocks higher.Here are highlights and lowlights from the big banks\u2019 earnings reports:J.P. Morgan Chase        JPM -0.94%      :\u00a0The largest bank in the country reported its highest quarterly net income ever, $7 billion, but investors still headed for the exits after last Friday\u2019s report because the bank trimmed its outlook for the second half of the year. Trading revenue was down 14% across bond and stock trading, while the\u00a0commercial bank and asset-management arm both posted record profits and double-digit increases over a year earlier.Goldman Sachs        GS 0.30%      :\u00a0Fixed-income revenue plummeted 40%, a dismal showing for Goldman\u2019s vaunted traders. Commodities, the business that vaulted Chief Executive       Lloyd Blankfein       to a corner office, posted its worst quarter ever as Goldman struggled to hedge its exposures.The firm did get a boost from private-equity investments. Revenue from Goldman\u2019s roughly $23 billion portfolio of equity stakes rose 88%, as some companies were sold and others were re-marked amid generally rising stock prices.Bank of America        BAC -1.10%      :\u00a0Lending at the Charlotte, N.C., bank didn\u2019t grow as much as some hoped. The nation\u2019s second-biggest lender posted a surprise decline in net interest income, after lowering guidance in recent weeks. The\u00a0metric, which executives initially said would rise about $150 million, fell by $72 million.Meanwhile, investment banking fees from merger advice and underwriting rose 9%. Merger fees hit a record as Bank of America leapfrogged J.P. Morgan and             Morgan Stanley        MS -0.84%       in the M&A rankings.Citigroup: Credit cards continued to weigh on the global bank. The New York firm run by CEO       Michael Corbat       added more credit losses than revenue from card usage, and raised its forecast for delinquencies on cards it manages for retailers. Overall, net income in its consumer-banking business fell 12%. The bank expects those results to turn around later this year. Picking up the slack: investment banking. Revenue rose 22% there as             Citigroup        C -0.07%       slid into second place in Dealogic\u2019s M&A rankings, its highest at this point in the year since at least 2008.Morgan Stanley:\u00a0The Wall Street firm run by CEO       James Gorman       was the exception this quarter.

But some big gaps remained. The biggest: Who gets to police the agreement?The EU says it has to be the EU\u2019s own courts. But the UK says once it leaves the bloc, EU courts won\u2019t have any jurisdiction in the U.K.There are some 3.2 million EU citizens in the U.K. and more than 1 million British people in Europe who will be directly affected by the outcome.\u00a0\u00a0At issue are the post-Brexit rights and benefits of these people and which bodies should enforce the commitments. Britain is expected to leave the bloc in March 2019.\u201cWe are now moving forward in a common direction,\u201d chief EU negotiator       Michel Barnier       said after the talks concluded\u00a0on Thursday. U.K. Brexit minister       David Davis       said overall he was encouraged at the progress made.Some tricky issues were left aside this week, including mutual recognition of professional qualifications and economic rights like some welfare payments.But other areas are advancing. While there are details to iron out, Britain\u2019s detailed June 26 citizens\u2019-rights paper included pledges to pay EU citizens\u2019 pensions and keep them in line with inflation. It also made clear the U.K. would still pay social security benefits, such as child benefits, to EU-based dependents of U.K. residents.The two sides disagree on whether Britain should be able to systematically run criminal-record checks on all EU nationals who apply for post-Brexit residency status. But Britain is offering a concession.In running those checks on people now in the U.K., Britain will stick to current EU rules, meaning it will refuse residency only to people who pose a threat to public safety. The U.K. won\u2019t apply the tougher rules it applies to non-EU nationals, under which it deports anyone given a prison sentence of 12 months or more.\u00a0By foregoing this, Mrs. May\u2019s government would allow thousands of EU criminals to stay in Britain permanently, a move that could prove unpopular.The U.K. is also signaling flexibility on another issue that has raised hackles in Brussels: voting rights for EU citizens who enjoy residency status in the U.K.Crucially, U.K. officials have sought to show this week that they aren\u2019t trying to box the EU into rewriting its freedom-of-movement, immigration or social-security rules. The U.K. team clarified its positions by describing them in terms of additions to or subtractions from the rights and benefits that EU legislation secures.Yet there are differences.\u00a0The EU has said the two sides must make \u201csufficient progress\u201d by October on this and other issues, including over financial payments, if it is to agree to start discussing a future trade deal with the U.K.For one,\u00a0while the EU wants to keep the current broad rights and benefits its citizens enjoy in Britain, it believes U.K. citizens in EU countries should receive residency rights only in the country they are living in\u2014not in any other country in the bloc. It isn\u2019t clear how hard the British government will push back on this.The U.K. is offering no clarity on the cut-off date after which new arrivals in the U.K. wouldn\u2019t receive a clear pathway to residency status. The EU wants that date defined as soon as possible, a step that could prove critical to meeting the \u201csufficient progress\u201d threshold.There are also differences\u00a0over\u00a0which kind of workers should be offered residency rights. The EU wants Britain to exempt so-called posted workers\u2014usually Eastern Europeans whose British employers pay lower social-security taxes to the worker\u2019s home country rather than higher rates at home\u2014and to include so-called frontier workers, who live in their home countries and travel to Britain to work.\u00a0Britain has counted on including posted workers in its residency offer and excluding frontier workers, though it seems flexible.The toughest issue is how an agreement would be enforced. Britain seeks an international agreement enforced in British courts and applying British law.The EU thinks that is an insufficient safeguard. They want the EU\u2019s courts to adjudicate disputes, U.K. courts to refer cases to the EU courts and an EU body to monitor compliance. Brussels\u2019 concern is to ensure EU citizens with grievances against the U.K. government would be able to seek enforcement of their legal rights directly and not have their efforts thwarted by the authorities.British officials hope the EU\u2019s position on this point is more flexible than publicly admitted. That would open the way of some kind of joint tribunal.\u00a0Yet Mr. Barnier was showing no signs of budging on this point.\u201cIt\u2019s not a choice, it\u2019s an obligation,\u201d Mr. Barnier said.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com and Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-and-eu-engage-on-citizens-rights-1500575874", "keywords": ["brexit, brexit negotiations, brexit talks, eu citizens' rights, u.k. citizens' rights ,European Union,British government,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 14:27:00", "news_title": "Tech Is No Bubble, But the Stock Market Might Be   ", "content": "U.S. technology stocks have finally passed their 17-year-old bubble-era high, and the speed of this year\u2019s rally has many\u2014including me\u2014concerned. The S&P 500\u2019s information-technology sector is up 23%. Of the 10 stocks adding the most market value, eight are tech stocks, when             Amazon.com        AMZN 1.24%       is included. Those who missed out surely regret it.But take a step back, and a lot of the gains look more like catch-up than bubble. There might be an everything bubble, but neither tech stocks nor mega-capitalization companies stand out as particularly frothy when looking at performance.In the past froth was obvious. In the dot-com bubble of 2000 the tech sector produced clearly unsustainable returns\u2014annualized at 53% including dividends for five years\u2014that were miles ahead of everything else. In the \u201cpeak oil\u201d bubble of 2008 the energy sector had similarly unrealistic five-year annualized gains of 31%.There\u2019s been nothing like this in recent years. It\u2019s true that tech stocks have been wonderful for investors this year, particularly the big names of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple,             Facebook                   and             Microsoft.       But they were mostly just catching up with underperformance in the aftermath of the election, when Silicon Valley was obviously out of favor with the new president, and hopes of tax cuts boosted companies that actually pay U.S. tax.Look instead at one-year or five-year performance and the tech sector is in line with the financial sector. Or go all the way back to the stock market low of March 2009: Since then financials and tech stock prices have both risen a bit more than 390%, as bank failure risk was priced out; including dividends, real estate, financials and consumer discretionary stocks are all ahead of tech over the period.It\u2019s true that some tech stocks are in other sectors, distorting the measure. Amazon is classed as retail, and its stellar performance generated about a fifth of the consumer discretionary sector\u2019s gains since the 2009 low\u2014and half this year\u2019s gains. But the financial sector rally has been about traditional banking and insurance\u2014not fintech, while real estate is as offline as a stock can be.Another way to judge excessive enthusiasm for disruptive companies should be to look at the losers. Old-style retail stocks, owners of U.S. malls and more recently stocks such as Zillow facing rumors of competition from Amazon have all been hammered.Have they been driven down too far? Taking the gap between the best and worst performing sectors offers a measure of how powerful investment fashions are, and it is wider than usual at the moment. Yet, it doesn\u2019t back up the disruption theory.Over the past year the best sector has outperformed the worst by more than 50 percentage points, the second-widest gap since the recovery from the crisis in 2009. In the 2000 bubble the gap reached 124 points, and in 2008 energy was 66 percentage points ahead of the worst sector (real estate, where the property-price crash was already under way).Yet, if this wide gap between the best and worst sectors is a reason to worry, it isn\u2019t a reason to worry about tech, since financials edged it as the best-performing over the past year, just. The worst performers were telecom, disrupted by an old-fashioned price war, and energy, disrupted by OPEC and shale.Perhaps enthusiasm for disruption doesn\u2019t show up between sectors, though. Amazon is disrupting retail, and new technologies are being deployed in many other sectors too. If investors were betting on the disrupters and against the disrupted, we should expect to see a big gap between the best and worst performers within sectors. We don\u2019t.Tim Edwards at S&P Dow Jones Indices calculates a measure known as dispersion showing how much variation there is in stock performance. Only in the industrial and financial sectors is it higher than the long-run average, and even within consumer discretionary the effect of Amazon isn\u2019t visible, with dispersion slightly below average.I think investors give Amazon and Tesla way too much credit as disrupters, but being overpriced isn\u2019t the same thing as being in a bubble. There could be an everything bubble lifting the entire market, but stock performance doesn\u2019t suggest over-enthusiastic investors have inflated a tech bubble or even a broader bubble of disrupters.

It has grown by 3.6% since the start of QE and created more than four million jobs, according to the ECB.Data to be released over the coming weeks\u2014including second-quarter growth figures on Aug. 16\u2014are likely to be \u201cremarkable,\u201d said Ken Wattret, an economist with TS Lombard in London.Against that backdrop, the ECB\u2019s aggressive stimulus, comprising subzero interest rates and bond purchases of \u20ac60 billion ($68.5 billion) a month, looks increasingly excessive.\u201cThe news flow will be a strong reinforcement of the case that something needs to be done\u201d by the ECB, Mr. Wattret said.Nevertheless, investors appeared to be caught off-guard when ECB President Mario Draghi signaled last month that the central bank might respond to the improved economic outlook by reducing its monetary stimulus. Critics of such a move stress that the ECB targets not growth but inflation, which remains too weak. The ECB aims to keep inflation at just below 2%, but it was just 1.3% last month.Even on that front, however, the ECB hasn\u2019t done a bad job. Inflation is roughly 2 percentage points higher than when QE was launched in early 2015, and approaching the ECB\u2019s target. Core inflation\u2014excluding volatile food and energy prices\u2014has risen to 1.1%, just off a four-year high. Many economists argue that central banks are bound to be unable to target inflation with a high degree of precision.Crucially, central banks need to move early when the economy is heating up to ensure that inflation doesn\u2019t rise too quickly, because their policies act with a time lag of two or three years. Even if the ECB acts quickly to wind down QE, it is likely to keep adding to its stockpile of bonds until at least the middle of next year.To be sure, policy makers don\u2019t fully understand why inflation hasn\u2019t picked up more. The ECB has repeatedly been forced to cut its inflation forecasts, most recently in June.Economists have suggested a range of reasons for the weakness in global inflation, including poorly understood technological advances, aging populations and globalized supply chains that restrict workers\u2019 ability to press for higher wages.Increasingly, though, major central banks have dismissed the importance of that weakness, and expressed confidence that normal economic relationships would reassert themselves as growth picks up around the world.The global economy is likely to expand by 3.5% this year, up from 3.1% last year, according to the International Monetary Fund. That should spur higher prices for commodities and other products.The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England both recently signaled that low inflation rates wouldn\u2019t deter them from moving toward higher interest rates.In Portugal last month, Mr. Draghi listed a range of factors holding down eurozone inflation, including external price shocks, a large number of underemployed or discouraged workers, and recent low inflation.\u201cThese effects, however, are on the whole temporary and should not cause inflation to deviate from its trend over the medium term,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.That judgment has found echo elsewhere.\u201cInflation can\u2019t be this way forever,\u201d said       Stefan Gerlach,        deputy governor of Ireland\u2019s central bank until 2015 and now chief economist at EFG Bank in Zurich. \u201cWith economic growth this strong, and global, the balance of evidence suggests this might start feeding into inflation.\u201dFed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       signaled this week that the U.S. central bank is still anticipating further rate increases despite low inflation, which is also dogging the U.S. economy.Ms. Yellen told Congress on Thursday that a stronger labor market and rising prices of imported goods supported her expectation that a recent downturn in inflation would prove transitory. Still, she said officials were watching inflation data \u201cvery carefully.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s preferred measure of core inflation was just 1.4% in May, and has languished below its 2% target for most of the past five years.Corrections & Amplifications   According to Eurostat, quarterly eurozone growth at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate was 1.5% in the first quarter of 2014 and 3.1% in the first quarter of 2015.

Members of opposition factions erected road barricades to block any remaining traffic, clashing in some neighborhoods with security forces.\u201cWe have to make the government understand that people are dying of hunger and lack of medicines,\u201d said Carlos Ram\u00edrez, an accountant who joined the strike in the eastern city of Puerto Ordaz.The country\u2019s biggest business and farming associations were among the groups that spoke in favor of the action, and the National Transport Federation told its 200,000 bus drivers to stay home.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that today is not a normal day and that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro doesn\u2019t have a way to prevent Venezuelans from exercising their will,\u201d said opposition lawmaker Juan Andr\u00e9s Mej\u00eda.\u201cWe accompany the citizens who are looking for a peaceful exit from this crisis,\u201d said Carlos Larrazabal, who is head of Fedec\u00e1meras, an umbrella organization for Venezuela\u2019s chambers of commerce. He added that many of its members have been effectively idled anyway because of the economic depression.The strike is part of the opposition\u2019s \u201cZero Hour\u201d protest campaign to prevent Mr. Maduro from staging a vote on July 30 for the Constituent Assembly, which is to be tasked with overhauling the country\u2019s political system. The opposition, which controls congress, and ruling party dissidents are boycotting the vote and calling it illegal.On Sunday, the opposition said it collected 7.6 million signatures, more than a third of all registered voters, in support of scrapping the vote. U.S. President       Donald Trump       promised \u201cswift economic actions\u201d if Mr. Maduro goes ahead with elections.Mr. Maduro has responded by doubling down on the election campaign and accusing Mr. Trump of imperialism.On Thursday, Mr. Maduro danced and sang at a youth rally in Caracas, playing the strike down as a failed effort by a few detractors. He threatened jail for the strike\u2019s organizers.Strikes have historically proved to be a risky tactic for opponents of Venezuela\u2019s ruling Socialist Party. In 2003, Mr. Maduro\u2019s mentor and predecessor, the late       Hugo Ch\u00e1vez,        defeated a monthslong strike called by the opposition and Fedec\u00e1meras.That event polarized the nation and paved the way for the government to further extend control over Venezuela\u2019s economy and political institutions under the auspices of its \u201cBolivarian Revolution.\u201d\u201cAlthough there\u2019s a lot criticism, any kind of national or international pressure adds up to the cause of making the government desist from the Constituent Assembly,\u201d said Ana Vallenilla, a striking saleswoman in Puerto Ordaz.\u2014Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez in Puerto Ordaz contributed to this article.Write to Anatoly Kurmanaev at Anatoly.kurmanaev@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelan-opposition-calls-strike-ahead-of-vote-for-constituent-assembly-1500562928", "keywords": ["constituent assembly,general strike,imperialism,new constitution,opposition forces,sanctions,streets deserted,venezuela,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,government bodies,executive branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 14:13:00", "news_title": "Time to Sing the Praises of Opera Librettists ", "content": "Without composers, there would be no operas\u2014no arias to linger in memory, no gripping orchestral accompaniment. But without the librettist, who provides the dramatic structure, scenarios, characters, and texts for the singers, there would be nothing to inspire those who furnish the music, sets, costumes and theatrical elements that engage our attention.Although the status of librettists has waxed and waned over the centuries, it\u2019s time to recognize their importance again, particularly in the creation of contemporary opera. The resurgence of storytelling, along with the heightened media attention accorded premieres, has helped fuel the commissioning of a plethora of new operas in the U.S. in recent years. And the seemingly insatiable appetite of presenters for \u201ccelebrity\u201d operas, as well as adaptations of well-known films and books, has put leading librettists like       Mark Campbell,       Gene Scheer       and       Royce Vavrek       in great demand. The latest example is \u201cThe (R)evolution of       Steve Jobs      \u201d by composer       Mason Bates       and Mr. Campbell, which receives its world premiere at Santa Fe Opera on Saturday.Experts like dramaturge       Cori Ellison,        a frequent consultant on new opera productions, say that today\u2019s operas are less formulaic, more labor-intensive and more collaborative in their development. All of which strengthens the view of librettists as co-creators rather than servants of the music.A case in point: Mr. Campbell\u2019s original libretto for the \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d opera employs a nonlinear approach and is based on extensive research into the Apple co-founder\u2019s life, achievements and practice of Soto Zen Buddhism. \u201cHow do you convey a complicated life in a 75-minute opera?\u201d asks Mr. Campbell. \u201cOne way is to focus on the emotional notes you want to hit.\u201dThe best librettists understand the way singers phrase, music flows and audiences listen. Mr. Campbell, whose previous libretto credits include \u201cThe Shining\u201d by       Paul Moravec       and the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cSilent Night\u201d by Kevin Puts, says the human ear can absorb only so many words when a line is sung.Once the libretto is approved, composers begin writing the music in earnest, bringing the story to life and underlining its expressive subtexts. That\u2019s when revisions begin. Composers may request more words ending in vowel sounds, easier to sing in high ranges. Or identify a need for another aria. After       David T. Little       began writing the score for \u201cDog Days,\u201d he asked Mr. Vavrek for a quiet moment to offer musical contrast. A poignant aria for the character of Mother, \u201cMy Legs Won\u2019t Walk Me,\u201d was born. Mr. Campbell credits Mr. Bates with helping him find the heart of the \u201cJobs\u201d opera when the composer asked him to further develop the character of       Laurene Powell Jobs,        Jobs\u2019s wife.Whatever its style, the libretto should ignite the composer\u2019s imagination.       Missy Mazzoli,        who has collaborated with Mr. Vavrek on three operas, including \u201cBreaking the Waves,\u201d says that when she reads his texts, she can \u201chear\u201d many things about the form, harmony and density of the music she\u2019ll compose. Mr. Bates, whose orchestral score for the \u201cJobs\u201d opera includes guitar, saxophones, Tibetan bells and electronics, was particularly energized by a line in Mr. Campbell\u2019s libretto that reads, \u201dThese machines should be something we play.\u201d He says it elicited music that he might not have otherwise written.The widespread use of supertitles, which shine laser-like scrutiny on clunky or implausible texts, has made it abundantly clear that the finest operas are ideal marriages of effective text and beautiful music, from       Hugo von Hofmannsthal\u2019s       eloquent lyrics for the aging Marschallin in       Richard Strauss\u2019s       \u201cDer Rosenkavalier\u201d to Montagu Slater\u2019s evocative libretto for       Benjamin Britten\u2019s       \u201c      Peter Grimes.      \u201dConsider, by contrast, \u201cDoctor Atomic\u201d by       John Adams,        whose tedious libretto by       Peter Sellars       is laden with documentary excerpts and scientific jargon. The highlight of the opera is Mr. Sellars\u2019s insertion of the magnificent aria \u201cBatter My Heart.\u201d Its chilling words, with their reference to the biblical Trinity, were penned by the Jacobean poet       John Donne.       Apt text wedded to musical genius galvanized what had been a trying first act.Today, the contributions of librettists are beginning to be acknowledged more widely. Their names appear more prominently in posters and other promotional material for world premieres. And on opening night, they usually are invited onstage to take a bow with the cast, composer and artistic team. But unlike Broadway musicals, where composer, lyricist and book writer typically share equally in royalties, opera composers receive the bulk of the remuneration because of the longer time needed to write and orchestrate their work. And when an opera wins an award, the composer normally gets the cash.Awards organizations should rethink this policy, given the symbiotic relationship between words and music. And opera presenters should give librettists of past and present alike their due. Why not \u201cThe Marriage of Figaro\u201d by       Mozart       and Da Ponte? After all, it was their creative interplay that turned a biting, five-hour political satire by Beaumarchais into a compelling operatic masterpiece.\u2014Ms. Jepson writes about classical music for the Journal and is president of the Music Critics Association of North America.Appeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Time to Sing Librettists\u2019 Praises.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/time-to-sing-the-praises-of-opera-librettists-1500574398", "keywords": ["arts in review, gene scheer, librettists, mark campbell, mason bates,opera, royce vavrek, santa fe opera, the (r)evolution of steve jobs,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,theater,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 14:05:00", "news_title": "U.S., Overseas Airlines Enhance Foreign Airport Security", "content": "Hundreds of foreign airports and U.S. and overseas airlines have made security enhancements necessary for passengers traveling direct to the U.S. to carry laptops into the cabin, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday.As of Thursday, all 180 U.S. and foreign airlines and 280 foreign airports have met the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the expanded security rules, the department said. As a result, the agency is no longer banning passengers from bringing laptops and other electronic devices into airplane cabins for trips the U.S. The agency had considered expanding that restriction due to fears that terrorists are aiming to take down a plane with explosives hidden in a laptop or tablet.The agency instituted a laptop ban in March for foreign carriers serving the U.S. from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Since then, those airlines have met enhanced security goals and the laptop ban has been dropped. The last two airports, both in Saudi Arabia, were cleared Thursday.Earlier this week, the agency said some airlines flying from the 280 foreign airports in 105 countries could still face restrictions on passengers transporting personal electronic devices as more security protocols are put in place. A DHS spokesman said he didn\u2019t know the number of airlines that could potentially be affected. No further restrictions are in place now, he said.Officials gave airlines 21 days to meet a mandate to install explosive-trace detection scanners at their foreign airports to randomly screen fliers\u2019 carry-on bags. More changes need to be made within four months, according to a memo the International Air Transport Association sent to its member airlines. Those steps include closer scrutiny of planes on the ground and more intensive customer screening.DHS declined to confirm that timeline.

The president is India\u2019s head of state, its first citizen, so to speak.Mr. Kovind\u2019s comfortable election Thursday\u2014about two-thirds of an electorate of roughly 4,900 state and central legislators picked him over his opposition-backed rival\u2014underscores the BJP\u2019s dominance of national politics. It also highlights an unfortunate fact: The near-monopoly of career politicians on the country\u2019s most exalted office.In India, a highly regarded scholar, general or businessman has virtually no chance of becoming president. Indeed, in the run-up to the election the only names seriously speculated about in the media belonged to politicians. For India\u2019s unimaginative leaders, the idea of elevating the great trade economist       Jagdish Bhagwati,        the industrialist       Ratan Tata       or the erudite cricketer       Rahul Dravid       to the presidency would be dead on arrival.Both the country and the presidency are poorer for choosing from a shallow talent pool. As India integrates into the global economy, its president could be someone who both represents the country with flair on the world stage and sets an example of excellence for fellow citizens. Instead, Indians invariably end up with someone spit out by a crude algorithm of caste, region and likely fealty to whoever happens to be in power.Take Mr. Kovind, plucked from relative obscurity as the unelected governor of the northern state of Bihar after the BJP announced last month that he would be its presidential candidate. According to media reports, Mr. Kovind twice failed to pass the exams for the highly competitive Indian Administrative Service before embarking upon a moderately successful career as a lawyer and politician. For much of his life, Mr. Kovind toiled silently in the BJP. He may be the party\u2019s only former spokesperson known for not speaking very much.On             Twitter,       Prime Minister       Narendra Modi       hailed Mr. Kovind as \u201ca farmer\u2019s son\u201d from \u201ca humble background.\u201d And BJP leaders have made much of his being born a Dalit, the caste grouping formerly known as untouchables. He is only the second Dalit to be elevated to the presidency.Nobody ought to grudge a journey from poverty to prominence, a hearteningly familiar occurrence in Indian democracy. In few other countries would someone born in Mr. Kovind\u2019s circumstances end up occupying a 340-room sandstone palace built for the British viceroy during colonial rule. But strip away the easy sentimentalism of the moment and you\u2019re left with little else.Bluntly put, Mr. Kovind has not earned his job for displaying any particularly outstanding qualities of head or heart. He will be president because he\u2019s a party loyalist who happens to have been born in the right home.Political pundits say Mr. Kovind\u2019s caste identity\u2014a Dalit from the populous state of Uttar Pradesh\u2014may help Mr. Modi\u2019s campaign for re-election in two years. Young Dalit voters played a crucial role in propelling the BJP to power nationally three years ago, and in Uttar Pradesh earlier this year.The new president\u2019s longstanding ties with the BJP and its parent organization, the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteer Corps), could also come in handy after the elections. When there\u2019s no clear winner, the president decides on who gets the first shot at forming a government.Not all of India\u2019s presidents have been uninspiring political plodders. The second president,       Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan       (1962-67), was a highly regarded philosopher who had taught ethics at Oxford University and published in European journals.The 11th president, A.P.J.       Abdul Kalam       (2002-07), worked his way up India\u2019s elite defense science establishment, and earned the moniker \u201cmissile man\u201d before becoming president. Kalam, who died two years ago, remains beloved among many Indians as a down-to-earth leader who preferred the bustle of a classroom full of students to the pomp and ceremony of his office.For the most part, however, India\u2019s presidential palace has been occupied by a string of mediocrities. According to a popular cartoon, one president reportedly signed Prime Minister       Indira Gandhi\u2019s       1975 proclamation suspending democracy while in the bathtub. Another famously declared that he would gladly sweep the floors at Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s command.The 12th president,       Pratibha Patil       (2007-12), another Nehru-Gandhi family loyalist, came into office tagged by corruption allegations. She left it notorious for burdening the exchequer with extravagant foreign tours.Compared with such predecessors, Mr. Kovind has reasonable odds of completing a successful term as president. Nonetheless, his selection has done nothing to burnish the reputation of either Mr. Modi or his chief lieutenant, BJP President       Amit Shah.With the numbers on their side, Messrs. Modi and Shah could have shown a little imagination and given India a president like Kalam, someone whose nonpolitical achievements merited respect and whose personality attracted affection. Instead the country just got yet another humdrum politician meant to check the right boxes and not rock the boat.Mr. Dhume is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and a columnist for WSJ.com.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/indias-incredibly-shrunken-presidency-1500573655", "keywords": [" bharatiya janata party,india, narendra modi, presidency, ram nath kovind,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 13:58:00", "news_title": "The Real Infrastructure Problem Is Politics", "content": "Regarding your editorial \u201cIf You\u2019re Riding Through Hell . . .\u201d (July 15): The saga of rail and transit neglect in New York City makes a sad story, but it\u2019s played out in many forms in other places.

While scientists like Stephen Hawking warn us that organized human existence hangs in the balance and implore us to take swift climate action, your readers are encouraged to focus on low politics. Republicans, who voted for this bill, we\u2019re instructed, \u201cwill now have a harder time using cap and trade as an issue next fall.\u201dThis editorial board remains so blinded by politics that it can\u2019t even recognize it\u2019s railing against a program that embodies the same free-market approach it supports. While bemoaning the costs \u201cmanufacturers, refiners and other employers\u201d face, the Journal doesn\u2019t tell readers why, in fact, these groups wholeheartedly support California\u2019s cap-and-trade program. Like Republicans who have long backed cap and trade, and those who just voted for its extension, these employers understand that this program is the most cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions\u2014three to five times cheaper than the alternative.Just hours before the vote,       Ronald Reagan\u2019s       Secretary of State       George Shultz       put it this way: \u201cPassing this bill on a bipartisan basis is something on which Ronald Reagan, as with the Montreal Protocol, would be proud.\u201dHere in California, we think it\u2019s a good thing when Republicans and Democrats set aside their differences. We hope others\u2014including the Journal\u2014join us before it\u2019s too late and honestly confront climate change.Gov. Jerry BrownSacramento, Calif.Let\u2019s be clear about the victories Republicans achieved with our cap-and-trade reforms in a deep blue Democrat state. We protected over 200,000 jobs, increased personal income by over $20 billion and reduced costs for California consumers by over $15 billion. We served our people and did our jobs as legislators by rolling back taxes, cutting regulations and protecting Californians from higher costs. Those are the facts. This is what we as Republicans fight for everyday all day.Progressive Democrats and radical environmental-justice groups strongly oppose this bill, while every major business group and industry supports it. That should tell you all you need to know. There is a lot of misinformation about this reform, and the record needs to be set straight that this isn\u2019t SB 32 (reduction in greenhouse gases) or SB 1 (gas-tax increase). We were able to reform the cap-and-trade program to create a market-based system that allows companies to achieve required environmental goals in what has irrefutably been recognized as the most effective and efficient manner possible.Without this reform, the far left would have created and implemented a carbon-tax command and control that would have caused taxes to skyrocket. We are talking about the cost of gas, food, utilities\u2014all things that Californians who can\u2019t afford a Tesla in the driveway and solar panels on their roof care about.When the Democrats passed SB 32 with a majority vote, it gave broad authority for unelected bureaucrats at the California Air Resources Board to impose burdensome and costly regulations on California businesses. Further, in 2010 at the height of the 2007-09 recession, California voters were given the chance to overturn the original GHG reduction bill with Proposition 23. It failed by more than a 20% margin. Even a majority of Republican-held districts voted against it.Republicans in California must live with the realities of a deep-blue Democratic state. This isn\u2019t Washington, D.C., or Kansas. We have to cut taxes and regulations every chance we get.

That break usually spans two weeks, but workers at the Bolt plant\u2014also building the slow-selling compact Chevrolet Sonic\u2014remain on vacation the third week of the month as inventories of both cars climb.A GM spokesman, saying the shutdown stems from the oversupply of Sonics, said workers will return to the Orion assembly line\u00a0on Monday. However, they will take another one-week break in August.The long layoff affecting the Bolt is unusual for a vehicle still considered to be in launch mode, and it delivers a blow to GM as             Tesla Inc.        TSLA 1.25%       is ramping up production of the Model 3, which is priced lower than its Chevrolet counterpart while offering a similar driving range on a single charge. The $35,000 Model 3, Tesla\u2019s fourth model, already has amassed hundreds of thousands of reservations from potential buyers.The $37,000 Bolt is struggling to drum up demand amid low gasoline prices. About 7,500 Bolts have been sold through June, though it is yet to go on sale in all 50 states.Sales of the Bolt roughly match the             Nissan                   Leaf, a lower-range electric car that has been available in the U.S. for several years.Electric vehicles make up just 0.6% of U.S. auto market in 2017, according to Autotrader.com, as inadequate charging infrastructure, high costs and low gasoline prices have muted demand.Haig Stoddard,        an analyst with Wards.com, said the Bolt is a strong performer among the field of electric vehicles, but it is \u201cnot selling as strong as GM had hoped.\u201d Tesla represents nearly half of electric-vehicle sales in the U.S., Autotrader estimates.\u201cObviously, GM has enough inventory of Bolts to accommodate sales if they\u2019re closing the plant,\u201d Autotrader.com analyst       Michelle Krebs       said. She said the car has gotten off to a \u201cslow start\u2026it\u2019s been an uphill battle.\u201dThe Bolt, under development for several years, helps the company meet tightening emissions standards, and buyers qualify for a $7,500 tax credit after the sale.\u201cPutting the Bolt into the market should be looked at as part of GM\u2019s R&D in electrification,\u201d Mr. Stoddard said. \u201cGM and the rest of the industry are preparing for the long term.\u201dJim Cain,        a GM spokesman, said the company has more than 100 days\u2019 supply of Bolt inventory on Chevrolet dealer lots (compared with an industry average of 74 days\u2019), but that number is distorted by the fact only some Chevy dealers currently offer the car.\u201cBy no stretch of the imagination are we overstocked,\u201d Mr. Cain said. \u201cWe have just built enough Bolt EVs to double the number of states where we sell to complete our nationwide rollout in August ahead of schedule.\u201d\u200bThe company\u2019s business plan differs from that of Tesla, whose automotive revenue derives solely from selling electric vehicles.GM\u2019s overall market share is stuck in neutral, falling below 17% as its fuel-efficient car offerings slump and it reins in low-margin sales to rental car companies.GM, highly dependent on light-truck sales for profit, has scrambled to manage rising inventories of slow-selling passenger cars, including conventional sedans. The auto maker is cutting jobs and slowing production at several of its passenger-car plants this year, including factories that make Chevrolet Malibu and Cadillac sedans.The Bolt has been acclaimed as an affordable alternative to Tesla\u2019s popular Model S, which often sells for more than $100,000. Unlike Tesla, however, GM doesn\u2019t offer buyers a dedicated charging network, and the company is reliant on an independent dealer network to sell the car.Adam Kraushaar,        president of Lester Glenn Auto Group located about 50 miles south of New York City in New Jersey, said his Chevy dealership is too far from the city for the Bolt to attract many people living in the community, even with its 238-mile range on a charge. Initial demand for the Bolt at his dealership was strong, but then dropped off \u201cfairly dramatically.\u201dAlthough the car isn\u2019t \u201csetting the world on fire,\u201d it isn\u2019t languishing, Mr. Kraushaar said.Paul Masse,        owner of Paul Masse Chevrolet in East Providence, R.I., thinks the Bolt will be a steady seller. Mr. Masse ordered 100 Bolts for his dealership, significantly more than GM was planning on sending him.Customers often come in looking for a crossover wagon, but once he tells them about the Bolt\u2019s range, roominess and the little maintenance that is required, he said he can change opinions. Since receiving his first order of 100 Bolts at the end of May, he said he has sold 22.\u201cOnce gas prices go up, you\u2019ll want a Bolt,\u201d Mr. Masse said. For now, he is offering a lease deal for zero dollars down and a payment of $249 a month.\u2014John Stoll contributed to this article.Write to Adrienne Roberts at Adrienne.Roberts@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'GM Small-Car Plant Takes a Rest.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-eases-summer-production-of-chevrolet-bolt-1500572932", "keywords": ["chevrolet bolt,chevy bolt,electric car,gm ,model 3,orion,plant ,production,tesla,workers,General Motors,GM,Tesla,TSLA,output,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 13:41:00", "news_title": "BP Said to Be Shopping Its North Sea Oil Fields", "content": "LONDON\u2014            BP        BP -0.17%       PLC has approached potential buyers of its oil-and gas fields in the North Sea, people familiar with the matter said, a half-century after the company helped pioneer deepwater extraction there.BP said it remained \u201ccommitted to the U.K. North Sea,\u201d which the British company sometimes calls its \u201cheartland.\u201d The company said it planned to ramp up its U.K. North Sea production to 200,000 barrels a day and pointed to important new developments there west of the Shetland Islands.But the company has held discussions about selling the full range of its currently producing assets in the U.K. North Sea, people familiar with the matter said. The collection of oil-and-gas fields now produce the equivalent of about 150,000 barrels a day, with some nearing the end of their production lives.The potential buyers include private-equity firms, the people said, which in recent years have swooped in to buy North Sea fields, lower their costs and extract profit.The people said the talks were at an early stage, and it isn\u2019t clear yet which fields BP would ultimately be willing to part with, if any.\u201cOur aim is to sustain a material business in the region for decades to come,\u201d said BP, which produces more oil and gas from the British North Sea than any other company.The value of the assets BP approached buyers about wasn\u2019t known. Earlier this year, when BP\u2019s British-Dutch rival Royal Dutch Shell PLC sold stakes in U.K. North Sea fields that produce about 115,000 barrels a day, the assets fetched $3.8 billion.The talks come as BP and other big energy companies reassess their portfolio of oil-and-gas fields as the crude-price downturn enters its fourth year. With prices stuck around $50 a barrel, BP, Shell and others have been looking to ditch oil fields that are nearly tapped out for cheap, quicker-hit options like U.S. shale.The North Sea is a prime example. BP has been a leader in the North Sea since the mid-1960s, when exploration and production began. Along with Shell and others, BP helped make it one of the world\u2019s premier oil basins in the 1970s and \u201880s, its production peaked in the 1990s.Since the peak, however, it has become more expensive to extract the remaining barrels from aging fields. BP already sold part of its interest in the North Sea\u2019s Magnus field to             EnQuest                   PLC earlier this year.\u201cThey can\u2019t get the returns in the North Sea compared to more attractive, lower-cost opportunities globally,\u201d said       Fiona Legate,        an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the Scottish energy consultancy.BP said it was firm about its commitment to the British North Sea. It is a major employer in Aberdeen, the Scottish port where its North Sea operations are headquartered.BP is under pressure to raise cash this year to pay for continuing costs related to the Deepwater Horizon blowout that killed 11 people in 2010 and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The company wants to raise $5.5 billion with various divestments this year. It is considering spinning off some of its U.S. pipelines into a separate public company.BP is moving into a period of growth, which may require it to shed some of its older North Sea assets, said Oswald Clint, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.\u201cIt\u2019s the same as Shell, they\u2019re selling producing assets, but not development or growth assets,\u201d Mr. Clint said.Selling assets in the U.K. North Sea isn\u2019t straightforward. It costs billions to dismantle and dispose the North Sea oil rigs when the fields are fully tapped. As part of its deal to sell North Sea fields this year, Shell agreed to pay up to $1 billion in decommissioning costs.\u2014Sarah Kent contributed to this article.Write to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com, Matt Jarzemsky at matthew.jarzemsky@wsj.com and Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bp-said-to-approach-possible-buyers-for-north-sea-assets-1500550514", "keywords": ["bp, bp divestment, bp north sea, bp north sea divestment,pe deals,pe industry news,BP,BP.LN,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,divestments,dj exclusive news - all,dj exclusive news - energy,dj exclusive news - equities,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities,integrated oil,gas"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 13:40:00", "news_title": "IMF Falls Short of Transparency Rules as Key Discussions Remain Secret ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The International Monetary Fund is failing to meet internal rules meant to increase transparency at the world\u2019s emergency lender, according to a Wall Street Journal review of executive board documents.Missing from public view is potential insight into the fund\u2019s high-level deliberations during one of the most eventful periods in its seven-decade history.The IMF, under rules set by the board in 2014, is supposed to provide public access to most board-meeting minutes between three to five years after the discussions. Documents marked \u201cstrictly confidential\u201d or \u201csecret\u201d require special approval for release by the managing director.But the IMF\u2019s online archive only has minutes up to 2010.The fund closed its physical archive to public visits in September, leaving the online archive as its portal for accessing board minutes and other IMF documents.The IMF has been unable to provide access to minutes from board meetings in 2011-14 that, under the transparency policy, should be available to the public\u2014despite several requests from the WSJ.The IMF said it has already declassified 10,000 documents under the new policy and is committed to implementing the 2014 board decision. \u201cBut there is some backlog to work through as each individual Executive Board meeting generates a large number of documents to process,\u201d the fund said.The board meets regularly throughout most of the year, often several times a week, as it reviews member-country evaluations, bailout programs and a host of other economic policy documents.The missing years cover one of the most tumultuous eras in the fund\u2019s history. The fund was at the center of a global economic maelstrom at the time, trying to prevent the European debt crisis from pulling the world economy back into recession and seeking to damp volatility in financial markets.Greece was on the verge of a eurozone exit, Portugal and Ireland needed to tap emergency financing, and Spain and Italy\u2014two of the world\u2019s largest economies\u2014were nearing possible bailouts themselves.In the middle of grappling with the eurozone and seeking a record increase in its lending resources, the fund suffered a leadership crisis when its chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was forced out amid a sex scandal.Besides offering fresh details of the fund\u2019s activities, the minutes of IMF board meetings can provide a different picture than the one presented publicly at the time.In 2010, for example, IMF officials said debt relief wasn\u2019t considered as part of the historically large Greek bailout package and there was unified support for the deal. But board deliberations from the May 2010 bailout meeting revealed deep internal divisions, broad discussions of debt relief and skepticism from top officials that the program could work.Transparency\u2014such as communicating its lending terms and releasing board minutes\u2014is necessary for preserving the IMF\u2019s credibility, says longtime IMF historian James Boughton, now a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation. That credibility gives countries the confidence to adopt fund advice and bailout terms.The IMF was for many years a highly secretive institution, Mr. Boughton said, especially as it advised member countries in the early decades on exchange rate policy. But as the fund\u2019s focus moved to sovereign bailouts requiring economic and budget overhauls, transparency became important for gaining support for its counsel.Since the mid-1990s, the fund has gradually opened up its doors to allow the outside world to read board minutes and staff deliberations.Greater openness, the IMF says on its website, builds traction for its policy advice and makes it easier to hold the institution accountable.\u201cOutside scrutiny should also support the quality of surveillance and IMF-supported programs,\u201d the fund\u2019s website says.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-falls-short-of-transparency-rules-as-key-discussions-remain-secret-1500572415", "keywords": ["euro crisis,european crisis,european debt crisis,greece bailout,greek bailout,imf,imf board meetings,imf transparency,International Monetary Fund"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 13:38:00", "news_title": "2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon: A Drag-Racing Beast, Unleashed", "content": "BECAUSE DRAG RACERS like to get to the finish line fast: The 2018 Dodge Demon ($86,090) is a wheelie-pulling, 840-hp version of the Dodge Challenger, extensively re-engineered for quarter-mile racing and offered as sizzle for the brand\u2019s aging, underselling steak.Mmmm, smell those roasted meats.Last winter the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) certified a quarter-mile E.T. (elapsed time) of 9.65 seconds with a trap speed of 140 mph, making this rocket-propelled pachyderm the quickest production car the organization had ever tested, exceeding even the all-electric Tesla Model S, which, by the way, is lousy at wheelies. The Demon jolts to 100 mph in an eye-crossing 5.1 seconds.Also, according to Guinness World Records, the Demon is the first production car capable of pulling a wheelie off the line. If you feel a \u201cwhy\u201d coming, no. There is no why.These displays require favorable weather conditions and a highly prepared drag strip, both of which Dodge arranged for last week at Lucas Oil Raceway in Indianapolis. The cars were making power and hooking up nicely, thank you. Incidentally, and not to throw shade at the Demon\u2019s production-car record, I would like to put drag slicks and gobs of traction compound on the all-wheel-drive, 1,500-hp Bugatti Chiron and see what happens. The thing would take off like a belt sander.The Demon is unique: a mass-produced, street-to-strip racing machine, complete with taffy-soft slicks, no less than a turnkey operation for amateurs, enthusiasts and poseurs. Every Demon will come with its own Demon Crate race-day tool chest (a $1 option), including floor jack, cordless impact driver, torque wrench, as well as the two skinny front wheels that get thrown on once the driver is at the track. (Hereafter and unless otherwise noted, everything is Demon-branded).It\u2019s not clear how many of the 3,300 Demons produced annually in Ontario, Canada, will ever boil them baloneys. For starry-eyed collectors, the car may be like the good couch that grandma keeps the plastic on.Speaking of plastic: It is not the monster engine that makes the Demon program possible but the wheel-arch extensions that shroud, just barely, the foot-wide Nitto drag slicks. I think these clip-ons look like hell, myself. Considering the Demon\u2019s price tag and the production volume, these flares should have been stamped out of steel, but             Fiat Chrysler Automobiles                   wouldn\u2019t lay out for the tooling.The Demon\u2019s genius lies in its engagement with American drag-racing culture and its roots in honorific dueling. For OEMs, this is largely unoccupied emotional territory. The staging lights, the wheelies, the hateful cumulus of tire smoke enveloping the burnout box\u2014to Boomers the Demon looks like Heaven.Dodge\u2019s previous assault on decency was the 707-hp Challenger SRT Hellcat in 2014. The Demon takes the Hellcat to darker places still. Under what Dodge says is the largest functional hood scoop in production, you will find the most powerful V8 engine ever stuffed in an OEM car: the supercharged 6.2-liter V8, producing 808 hp and 717 lb-ft of torque, and that\u2019s just on 91 octane pump gas.Fill up with 100 octane racing fuel, and max power rises to 840 hp at 6,300 rpm and 770 lb-ft of torque. Oy! There is a special switch in the center-stack to remap the engine-management software. Two dual-stage fuel pumps and high-flow injectors pour gas on this exquisite fire.Crowning the engine bay, making its own cyclonic weather, is a 2.7-liter supercharger running at 14.5 psi max boost. Get this: In Drag mode, the car\u2019s air conditioning system is used to chill intake air (cooler air makes more horsepower). This diversion of the cabin A/C makes all kinds of sense, but since you have to roll the windows up to race, the Demon can get a bit clammy on the line. It was about 90 degrees in Indianapolis. I used my balaclava to wipe down the interior for the next driver.This world-historical poke gets channeled through a race-reinforced drivetrain: upsized torque converter, drive shaft, rear differential (3.07 final-drive ratio) and half-shafts. Perhaps the Demon\u2019s most amazing feature is a factory warranty.Rolling through the water in the burnout box, I clamped the brakes with my left foot and goosed the throttle. (The Demon does have a line-lock feature for assisted burnouts, but it\u2019s fiddly, so I skipped it.) The supercharger screamed. The car\u2019s back end stood up. Smoke pouring off the melting rear tires whited out the sky. OK, the tires are officially warm.The Demon is also the first production car to use a trans-brake for launch control. This system brake-holds the output shaft of the 8-speed transmission while engine rpm spools up. Once the trans-brake is set, all the driver needs to do is release a single paddle shifter and continue to scream normally. As always, go on yellow.\u2018This rocket-propelled pachyderm the quickest production car the NHRA had ever tested, exceeding even the Tesla Model S.\u2019I executed the trans-brake sequence as instructed, more or less, setting rpm around 1600 rpm\u2014optimum, given the track\u2019s adhesion, I was told. Once staged, the Demon\u2019s stupendous V8 rattled like a medium machine gun. I released the paddle shifter.A veritable spasm of now. The car seat slammed me from behind with an acceleration of about 1.8 g. Such extreme forces reveal humans in all their semi-gelatinous corporeality. I could feel belly fat surging toward my neck.The vast hood reared up in front of me and didn\u2019t level off until the car had executed three perfect upshifts and was whining like a vacuum cleaner ingesting a sock. The instrument display flashed: 10.8 seconds. I\u2019ll take it.Away from the drag strip, the Demon is a pretty weird and fetishy automobile, starting with its paramilitary stance on those 315/40 slicks and 18-inch black rims. Cops of the future sure look tough.The Demon is hella heavy: 4,250 pounds at its lightest, i.e., wearing the skinny front wheels and with the passenger seats removed. One engineer at the press event had the gall to utter the phrase \u201cmass optimization.\u201d You cad.Theoretically, the Demon may offer the plushest highway ride in the Dodge inventory, what with its tall sidewall tires and super-soft suspension to aid weight transfer (more vehicle squat equals more holeshot traction). But cornering? After my first pass I let the 2-ton car roll through to the shutdown area to reach the last turnout. As I was braking and turning left, the Demon\u2019s body sloshed diagonally like it was a 1970 Chrysler Newport.To cut weight, the Demon does use a smaller front sway bar and brakes than the Hellcat, but customers are free to lard back up. The front passenger seat, rear seat and trunk-carpet kit are all $1 options. You can order this car with heated and cooled leather seats and a 18-speaker/900-watt audio system. The sunroof is a $4,995 option. I wonder how the NHRA feels about those?And the fact that the Demon\u2019s front passenger seat is optional is so poignant.Anybody wanna go for a ride?

The Indian intervention has triggered a furious reaction from China, which is warning India almost daily to back down or face reprisals, including a possible war. India has mobilized up to 10,000 troops for any contingency. . . .The Chinese defense ministry has warned India to learn the \u201chistorical lessons\u201d from the major military reversals it suffered in 1962 when China carried out a surprise trans-Himalayan invasion just when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were locked in the Cuban missile crisis.

However, the more China threatens India and the more it refuses to seek a compromise, the more it paints itself in a corner.Beijing has no good options in emerging as a winner from this confrontation. Given the geography, military logistics, weapon deployments and the entrenched Indian positions, the PLA will find it hard to give India a bloody nose and seize Doklam.

People would get coffee and often a muffin or something else to eat. Now the chain has raised the flat price at its cafes to six shekels, and suddenly my friends don\u2019t go anymore. Why? \u2014RonSome time ago, Unilever entered several markets in India and Africa, offering tiny amounts of products such as soap or milk in packages that were small and inexpensive. According to conversations I\u2019ve had with Unilever executives, the company found that it could do well selling these products so long as the price for them matched one of the smaller coins then circulating in the economy.For example, as long as people in Kenya were buying a small portion of milk for 10 shillings, they would purchase a lot of it. But, I was told, when the cost increased even a smidgen over the value of such a small local coin, sales dropped dramatically.I suspect that your coffee shop is suffering for the same reason. In Israel, the five-shekel coin is widely used, and though Israel has smaller coins, the same general principle probably applies: People are more inclined to buy items that are priced on the scale of familiar, low-denomination coins.When something costs the same as a coin, we can categorize the purchase as cheap and not think too much about it. But the moment something costs more than a single coin, we start thinking more carefully about whether or not we want to buy it.Dear Dan,I turned 40 this year, and it is getting harder and harder for me to read text on my cellphone. Why did cellphone companies start reducing the font sizes on our phones? \u2014AyeletIt\u2019s clearly a conspiracy among evil conglomerates. The cellphone companies are joining forces with the eyeglasses companies to persuade those of us over 40 that our eyesight is deteriorating and we need to buy new glasses.On the other hand, it may be that sometimes we just don\u2019t want to acknowledge certain conclusions or get certain answers (that we are spending more than we should, that we are getting older and so on). In such cases, people turn out to have a startling ability for self-delusion, even when the desire not to acknowledge the truth in the short term can hurt us in the long term.So maybe you should try to adopt eyeglasses as a fashion statement and use them to express your new, somewhat older and increasingly excellent self. (And happy birthday!)Dear Dan,I\u2019m going to host a party soon with some old and new friends, and I want to do something to break the ice. Any advice? \u2014MoranIn such situations, I find it very useful to start the evening by declaring that the event will operate under Las Vegas rules: What happens at the party stays at the party.

The shift in mix squeezed interest margins at the firm.BNY Mellon has a smaller wealth-management business, whose clients tend to move their deposits more quickly than large institutions, said longtime finance chief Todd Gibbons in an interview Thursday.

Some managers, like ex-            Goldman Sachs                   star       Eric Mindich,        have outright closed up shop, while others have openly wondered whether it was worth sticking around if they have to cut their notoriously high fees to do so.The bounce back in fundraising comes amid a steady stretch for hedge-fund investment performance in the first half of the year, with the average fund up 3.6% overall. Helped by consistent gains for U.S. stocks, the industry has posted 15 monthly gains out of the past 16, the longest such streak since 2004.Hedge-fund executives have also flagged renewed interest from international investors in the Middle East and Asia as helping overcome dimming support for hedge funds from big-money backers in the U.S. and Europe.A single quarter\u2019s bounce back won\u2019t cure all of the hedge-fund industry\u2019s woes.The recent inflows just barely overcome the $5.5 billion cashed out in the first quarter, when brand-names like\u00a0            Och-Ziff Capital                   Management\u00a0experienced heavy redemptions.And as The Wall Street Journal reported\u00a0Thursday, many managers are preparing to sell off investments\u2014thus shrinking their firms\u2014to pay a tax bill on deferred income\u00a0due at year-end.Quantitative traders, prized\u00a0as the new kings of Wall Street, soaked up the most new money in the second quarter, HFR said.

A single showing of the film can induce intoxication from a surfeit of gorgeous images. Outlandish creatures fill the screen, shifting shapes as they go. An aurora shimmers in the daytime sky of an alien world. Exotic settings materialize in a delirium of decoration. Too-muchness is an aesthetic principle in this sci-fi spectacle, based on a French comic-book series launched in the 1960s, and that\u2019s part of the eye-numbing fun. But the two young crime fighters at the center of the story, Maj. Valerian (      Dane DeHaan      ) and his partner, Sgt. Laureline (      Cara Delevingne      ), are no fun at all. Seldom has such a glittering wagon been hitched to such dull stars.The plot, set in the 28th century, concerns a mysterious radioactive force that threatens the existence of an extragalactic metropolis called Alpha. The cast includes       Herbie Hancock      \u2014yes, that Herbie Hancock\u2014as the Minister of Defense;       Clive Owen       as       Arun Filitt,        an Alpha commander;       Ethan Hawke       as Jolly, a grotesque pimp; and Rihanna, who makes a stunning spectacle of herself as a shape-shifting dancer named Bubble.In the interest of full disclosure, I didn\u2019t see \u201cValerian\u201d under ideal circumstances. The 3-D system went out of whack before my screening, so the film was shown in 2-D. Maybe that extra dimension would have enhanced the acting along with the physical production, which was designed by       Hugues Tissandier       and photographed by the superb       Thierry Arbogast.       (      Alexandre Desplat       wrote the elegant score.) I doubt it, though. Technology can\u2019t generate verve\u2014at least not yet\u2014or the sort of chemistry that\u2019s entirely absent in the pairing of these attractive performers.

Claire\u2019s exuberant neighbor, Paul, an international truck driver who knows fine wines and caviar, is played by Olivier Gourmet; you\u2019ve seen him, or should try to see him, in a number of movies made in Belgium by the Dardenne brothers, Jean-Pierre and Luc.

Many winemakers overdo it. And most every wine merchant and sommelier spends lots of time explaining it. I\u2019m talking about the relationship between wine and oak, a perennial hot topic in the wine world.Wine has been matured in oak barrels for centuries, of course; some of the greatest wines in the world are aged in oak, sometimes for several years. Yet a backlash against oak has been building for decades, and it seems to have gained momentum in recent years. More and more winemakers have either reduced the time their wines spend in oak or eliminated the use of oak altogether, believing the practice can obscure the true taste of a wine. Rioja-based winemaker       Telmo Rodr\u00edguez       called oak a \u201ccosmetic\u201d in a recent email to me, saying that it masks \u201cthe taste of the terroir\u201d\u2014and he\u2019s far from alone in his opinion.How could something so important be so maligned? The right oak barrel, judiciously employed, can add character and interest, structure and richness to a red or white and even some ros\u00e9s. But oak can also overpower a wine if it\u2019s a poor match, resulting in that feared and maligned \u201coaky\u201d wine.Wine drinkers are especially wary of oaky whites, according to       Jason Jacobeit,        wine director at B\u00e2tard restaurant in New York. A Chardonnay aged in new oak will be much richer than one aged in stainless steel, and much darker-gold in color. Burlingame, Calif.-based wine merchant       Gerald Weisl       said he believes that often customers ask for a \u201cless oaky\u201d Chardonnay because they think a wine with more oak will be higher in alcohol. (Not true.)\u2018Some winemakers say that oak masks the \u2018taste of the terroir.\u2019 \u2019The oak applied to Chardonnay is invariably French oak, more or less the gold standard for barrels in the case of both red and white wines\u2014and its price reflects that fact. A new French oak barrel from a top cooperage (tonnellerie) costs around $1,000, while a new American oak barrel costs about $600. Though barrel makers source oak from all over the world\u2014notably Russia, Hungary and Slovenia\u2014French and American oak barrels are the two most important types and they lend some very different characteristics to wine.American oak tends to confer more obvious, sweet notes of vanilla and coconut (thanks to a higher concentration of something called lactones in the American species of wood), while tighter-grained French oak contributes more restrained savory-spicy notes.The differences between American and French oak actually start with the forests themselves. In America, the forests that supply barrel wood are privately owned; the French oak forests are mostly managed by the French government. Few producers know the names of the very best American sources, while the five key sources of French oak\u2014Allier, Tron\u00e7ais, Nevers, Vosges and Limousin\u2014are known to winemakers and oenophiles as their names often appear on the ends of barrels.Each of the French forests produces a particular type of oak, sourced by tonneliers or brokers who specialize in a particular type of barrel. A barrel is called new if it hasn\u2019t previously been used to hold or age wine, but the wood used to make a barrel ages for two, three or even four years\u2014the longer the aging the mellower the wood\u2014before becoming a barrel.\u201cToasting\u201d describes the process of flavoring a barrel and also reducing the astringency of the oak by placing the newly-made barrel directly over a flame. Winemakers can order barrels toasted to their specifications\u2014light to medium, medium-plus or heavy toast; the process stops short of outright charring\u2014directly from the barrel producer or their barrel salesman.A good barrel salesman can help interpret a winemaker\u2019s vision of a wine. One of the best in the business for decades,       Mel Knox       is the San Francisco-based sales consultant to two of the top tonnelleries, Fran\u00e7ois Fr\u00e8res in Burgundy and Taransaud in Cognac. Over the years, Mr. Knox has acquired new clients after tasting wines that he felt needed his help and paying the winemakers discreet calls.Mr. Knox has probably sold more barrels to top winemakers in California than anyone else in the business\u2014including stars like       Steve Kistler       and       David Ramey.       Mr. Ramey, a Sonoma-based winemaker, probably knows as much about barrels as Mr. Knox. He\u2019s backed away from using large quantities of new oak, most notably in his Chardonnays. His single-vineyard Chardonnays were once aged for 65-70% of the time in new oak barrels and the rest of the time in previously used barrels. \u201cNow it\u2019s more like 20% new oak,\u201d said Mr. Ramey. This has meant a big savings on new barrels. \u201cMy wife, who writes all the checks, is ecstatic,\u201d he added.Yet for him the choice was a stylistic rather than an economic one, noted Mr. Ramey. He simply preferred the way his Chardonnays tasted with a more limited impression of oak. By contrast, he has not backed away from new oak with his Cabernet and Merlot-based Napa reds. \u201cThose wines can absorb it without being overwhelmed,\u201d said Mr. Ramey. Of course, he added, that kind of oak has to be applied to denser, more concentrated fruit\u2014\u201chillside not valley floor,\u201d in Mr. Ramey\u2019s terms\u2014which has bigger tannins and is substantive enough to stand up to and thrive in new oak.A winemaker has to have the vision and integrity to assess his wine accurately. And of course the wine has to be worth the investment of many new $1,000 barrels each year. This last fact is especially important since the worth of a new barrel drops precipitously after it\u2019s used\u2014much like a new car after it\u2019s driven off the dealer\u2019s lot.A used French or American oak barrel is worth about $20 according to       Ron Celaya,        the sales manager at Demptos Napa Cooperage, a French outfit in Napa and France. \u201cMost winemakers will use [new] barrels for three to five years,\u201d said Mr. Celaya. His company offers winemakers a \u201cbuy back\u201d for the barrels and ships them to whisky producers in Scotland.Like Mr. Knox, Mr. Celaya plays an active role in helping producers select the right barrel, usually tasting a wine during various stages of its development. \u201cIt comes down to tasting a few wines to get a sense of what they want,\u201d he said. If a client is looking for a sweeter profile, for example, he might recommend American over French oak. But above all, a good barrel salesman has to be able to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d a wine and to imagine how it will evolve over time.Fortunately oenophiles don\u2019t have to deconstruct the wines they drink to know if they\u2019re too oaky. Even in a young wine, the oak should never stand out too much. A well-made wine is always balanced, whether fermented and aged in oak or not.\u201cAged in 100% new French oak.\u201d This signals that the winemaker has spent some money, since new French oak barrels are costly. The wine is likely to be full-bodied, densely-fruited and, when young, tannic.\u201cAged in American oak.\u201d American oak imparts a sweet vanilla note drinkers love or loathe. Wines aged in this kind of wood tend to be softer. Popular Silver Oak Cabernet from California is aged in American oak as are many Riojas. American oak costs a lot less, so it often shows up in cheaper wines, too.\u201cAged in French and American oak barrels.\u201d Some winemakers hedge their bets financially and stylistically by using both kinds of barrel, giving the wine a more tannic structure with the French oak and sweeter aromatics with the American oak.\u2014Email Lettie at wine@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-oak-makesor-breaksa-wine-1500570574", "keywords": ["oak barrels,oak wine,oaky wine,wine barrels,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer,spirits,reviews,beverages,tobacco,retail,wholesale,cigarette,newspaper,liquor stores,specialty stores,alcoholic beverages,drinks,consumer goods,wine merchants"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 13:09:00", "news_title": "Global Crackdown Shuts Two of the Dark Web\u2019s Biggest Sites for Drugs and Guns ", "content": "Two of the world\u2019s largest online marketplaces for criminal goods have been shut down, law enforcement authorities said Thursday, in a global operation that also resulted in the arrest of their owners and the freezing of millions of dollars in alleged criminal proceeds.AlphaBay, which sold heroin, fentanyl, firearms, and other illicit goods and allegedly serviced some 200,000 users and 40,000 vendors, was shut down earlier this month and its infrastructure seized, the Justice Department said. Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       described it as \u201cone of the most important criminal investigations of the year\u201d and one that would serve as a blow to drug traffickers and other criminals.The website\u2019s alleged owner, Canadian-born       Alexandre Cazes,        was indicted in California in June and arrested in Thailand, authorities said. He was found dead in his cell on July 12. Authorities in Thailand, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Canada, the U.K. and France, and the European law enforcement agency Europol all participated in the investigation.In addition to operating an anonymous \u201cDark Web\u201d site, Mr. Cazes used digital currency and a dizzying web of international bank accounts in an effort to conceal his identity, federal prosecutors said.\u201cThey think they will get away with it because there are too many players in too many countries,\u201d said       Andrew McCabe,        acting director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.On Wednesday, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Sacramento, Calif., filed a civil forfeiture action seeking to seize assets it said belonged to Mr. Cazes and his wife in Thailand, Cyprus, Liechtenstein, and Antigua & Barbuda.Dutch police seized control of a second marketplace, Hansa Market, in late June and had control of the site since, the Dutch National Police said Thursday. Authorities closed the online marketplace on Thursday after arresting two men from Siegen, Germany, and seizing digital currency accounts valued at approximately $2.6 million, or 1,000 bitcoins, Dutch police said. The two alleged administrators, aged 30 and 31, weren\u2019t named by Dutch police.By operating the Hansa website for several weeks, police were able to intercept tens of thousands of messages between sellers and buyers on the site and collect more than 10,000 delivery addresses, Dutch police said. The site averaged 1,000 orders a day, most of which were for \u201chard drugs,\u201d they said.The surveillance is likely to give pause to some Dark Web users, said       Nicolas Christin,        an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies online marketplaces. \u201cThis will probably have a stronger chilling factor than a mere seizure,\u201d he said.Mr. Cazes, 25, lived a lavish lifestyle in Thailand, where he owned 10 vehicles including a $900,000 Lamborghini and a $293,000 Porsche Panamera, according to court filings. Mr. Cazes also owned a vacation home in Phuket, Thailand, and real estate in Bangkok and Cypress as well as a beachfront property in Antigua & Barbuda, the filings said.After discovering the digital keys to his digital currency accounts stored on his home computer, police seized approximately $8.8 million in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero and Zcash, all digital currencies.Investigators say Mr. Cazes earned commissions of between 2% and 4% on AlphaBay sales. They counted more than 4 million AlphaBay transactions between May 2015 and February 2017 valued at approximately $450 million. Mr. Cazes earned between $9 million and $18 million during that period, they estimate.Attempts to reach an attorney for Mr. Cazes weren\u2019t successful.Created in December, 2014\u2014just over a year after federal authorities shut down Silk Road, another illicit online marketplace--AlphaBay was run by a team of approximately eight to 10 anonymous staffers, including a second site administrator identified only as \u201cDeSnake,\u201d federal authorities said.Before it was closed on July 5, AlphaBay was the biggest marketplace on the Dark Web, said Andrei Barysevich, a director at Recorded Future Inc., a threat intelligence company. While Silk Road primarily focused on drug sales, AlphaBay also sold stolen credit card numbers, drugs, online-fraud tutorials and guns, he said.The Dark Web has emerged as a troubling source of illegal gun sales, researchers say. According to a Rand Corp. study, arms sales on the Dark Web now total an average of $80,000 a month. \u201cDue to the arms trade on the dark web, every month there could be up to 136 untraced firearms or associated products in the real world.,\u201d Rand said Thursday.Dark Web sites such as AlphaBay are reachable via the Tor browser, which uses a special network that takes steps to preserve the anonymity of its users.AlphaBay was averaging between $600,000 and $800,000 in sales a day, Mr. Christin said.Write to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com and Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Illicit Online Markets Shuttered.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/authorities-close-two-large-illegal-goods-websites-1500568971", "keywords": ["alphabay,dark web, hansa market, illegal goods marketplaces,illegal-gppds website,Europol,Hansa Market,political,general news,crime,legal action,cybercrime,hacking,criminal enterprises,trafficking,smuggling"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 12:59:00", "news_title": "Beer and Wine in the Same Glass?

These cross-genre blends of beer, wine, booze and soda bring playful irreverence to summer refreshment.Experimenting with wild yeasts and natural fermentation, brewers have found common ground with winemakers. Once the staff at Texas\u2019s Jester King Brewery saw neighboring Hill Country wineries using the same natural-fermentation tricks they did\u2014barrels, open tanks, local microbes\u2014borrowing fruit from them seemed a logical next step.Jester King SPON Albari\u00f1o & Blanc du Bois is a Belgian-style lambic beer refermented with wine grapes. \u201cWe had to develop our palate,\u201d said Jester King founder       Jeffrey Stuffings,        \u201clearn to identify what flavors are good, what\u2019s bad, what just needs time.\u201d One early experiment with Blanc du Bois grapes gave off \u201cthis funky, overripe-fruit smell,\u201d Mr. Stuffings said, \u201cbut then we drank some Sauvignon Blanc made with those grapes and tasted the same flavor. That gave us confidence we weren\u2019t off course.\u201dAll these beer blends are born of exploration, made by brewers chasing exotic yeasts once limited to cider, mead and even sake. Unity Brewing Co. ferments a gluten-free beer using the bacteria and yeast normally found in kombucha. Cambridge Brewing uses sake\u2019s unique mix of yeast and koji (a mold). To produce its Bitches Brew, Dogfish Head studied the traditional honey fermentation that makes ancient African t\u2019ej wine.Before the advent of modern brewing, with its clearly delineated styles and designated yeast strains, brewers worked with a splash of this, a pinch of that and a hefty helping of respectful resignation to the mysteries of fermentation. There\u2019s an element of improvisation to these new brews, and that\u2019s what makes them fun. \u201cIn the early days, we were crushing grapes with baseball bats,\u201d said Allagash brewmaster       Jason Perkins.They\u2019ve grown up, somewhat. Dogfish Head plans to release its Bitches Brew in canned six packs this year\u2014big news for a beer once available only as a centerpiece-size shareable bottle. Will that workaday packaging detract from its distinctiveness? Allagash\u2019s Mr. Perkins believes these beers deserve attention, not affectation. \u201cWhen I\u2019m drinking wine, it\u2019s usually out of grandma\u2019s juice glasses,\u201d he said. And he drinks these beers from nothing more pompous than a short, wide-mouth glass to direct and disperse their aromas. \u201cI\u2019m practical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re brewers at heart.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beer-and-wine-in-the-same-glass-its-actually-delicious-1500569946", "keywords": ["barbecue beverages,barbecue drinks,beer-wine hybrids,best beers,craft brewing,recommended craft brews,summer beers,wild fermentation,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer,spirits,beverages,tobacco,alcoholic beverages,drinks,consumer goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 12:57:00", "news_title": "\u2018Twelfth Night\u2019 Review: Silly Succor for Modern Malaise", "content": "Garrison, N.Y.With two Broadway successes, \u201cHand to God\u201d and \u201cPresent Laughter,\u201d under his belt,       Moritz von Stuelpnagel       is now looking like the most talented director of stage comedy to come along since       John Rando.       So it\u2019s happy news that he\u2019s upped his personal ante by staging \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d for the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival. It is, after all, a big leap from No\u00ebl Coward to Shakespearean comedy, one that many similarly talented directors never attempt. Funny though \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d is, most of the laughs don\u2019t come of their own accord: They need careful, knowing tending in order to explode on schedule. But Mr. Von Stuelpnagel knows his comic stuff, and he\u2019s given us a show that\u2019s every bit as enjoyable as its predecessors.Twelfth NightHudson Valley Shakespeare Festival, Boscobel House and Gardens, Garrison, N.Y.  $21.75-$64.75, 845-265-9575, closes Aug. 26Unlike most modern-day Shakespeare directors, Mr. Von Stuelpnagel has chosen not to overlay his \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d with a high concept: It\u2019s a colorfully stylized semi-modern-dress staging, but otherwise the show keeps to the center of the theatrical road. The cast is mostly young, and the actors themselves perform Palmer Hefferan\u2019s incidental music in a cheerfully rough-and-ready manner. The results are as festive as their setting, a huge tent pitched on the great lawn of the Boscobel House and Gardens, a handsomely restored 1808 estate situated on a wooded bluff perched high above the Hudson River. Even when the weather is less than inviting, I can\u2019t think of a prettier place to see an outdoor show.Hudson Valley always has fine clowns on tap, and       Kurt Rhoads       and       Sean McNall,        who play       Toby Belch       and       Andrew Aguecheek,        set the tone for the show, with the emphasis placed squarely on broad, bawdy comedy. (Without getting too graphic for the readers of a family paper, suffice it to say that Sir Toby appears to be suffering from a fairly severe case of prostate trouble.) Anyone seeking temporary surcease from the rigors of the present moment will find it in abundance here.The only thing missing is the hard nub of dramatic seriousness that issues from the climactic humiliation of Malvolio.       Stephen Paul Johnson,        dressed in the pompous manner of an 18th-century lawyer, is a bit too quick to shift into full-tilt comic mode when he receives the forged letter intended to fool him into thinking that Olivia (      Krystel Lucas      ), his employer, has fallen in love with him. It strikes me that Mr. Von Stuelpnagel has in this case erred on the side of broadness, in much the same way that he erred by treating       Roland Maule       as a figure of too-obvious buffoonery in his production of \u201cPresent Laughter.\u201d Malvolio is a grotesque, not a clown, and \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d at least for me, works best when he\u2019s played perfectly, even rigidly straight, succumbing to unrequited love and exploding with justifiable rage at play\u2019s end when he discovers that Sirs Andrew and Toby\u2014who are, lest we forget, his social superiors, vulgar and loutish though they are\u2014have made heartless sport of him.This is, however, both a matter of taste and a counsel of perfection: \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d is above all things a buoyantly light comedy, and Mr. Von Stuelpnagel and his excellent cast never fail to make you smile. I rejoice that       Davis McCallum,        who has racked up an impressive track record since becoming Hudson Valley\u2019s artistic director in 2015, has dared to entrust a Shakespeare play to an artist not previously known for his stagings of the classics. It\u2019s a gamble that has paid off, and one that I hope will be repeated in seasons to come.Mr. Teachout is the Journal\u2019s drama critic. \u201cBilly and Me,\u201d his new play, opens at Palm Beach Dramaworks on Dec. 8.

HLT -0.89%       and office buildings acquired in the 2007 buyout of Equity Office Properties Trust during the quarter. A decade of recovery in real-estate markets has reversed early losses on the pre-financial crisis bets of investors such as Blackstone, which acquired Hilton for $18.5 billion and Equity Office for $39 billion in 2007.In June, Blackstone struck a deal to sell Logicor, a European logistics real-estate firm, to affiliates of China Investment Corp. for about $14 billion.For the quarter ended June 30, Blackstone\u2019s earnings rose to $342.8 million, or 51 cents a share, from $198.6 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier.Its economic profit, a closely watched measure of performance that reflects changes in the value of unrealized investments, rose 36% to $705.4 million, or 59 cents a share, though it missed analysts\u2019 estimates for 62 cents.Shares edged 2 cents higher to $34.80 in midday trading Thursday, in line with the stock moves of its peers. June marked 10 years since Blackstone\u2019s IPO, which priced at $31.The firm expects its new infrastructure business to begin investing in early 2018, Mr. James said on the conference call. Blackstone has yet to raise the remaining half of the $40 billion it hopes to gather to invest in airports, pipelines and other public projects, after securing a $20 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund.Political and business leaders have increasingly called for improvements in U.S. infrastructure, and President       Donald Trump       has proposed government action to catalyze those efforts.

Though its history dates to the 1600s, the baguette cut \u201cbecame more prominent in the 1920s during the art deco period,\u201d explained Lori Gross, author of \u201cBrooches: Timeless Adornment.\u201d With their straight edges, the stones were suited to being creatively stacked and tiled. \u201cSome of the Cartier and Van Cleef pieces from that period have the most fantastical shapes,\u201d said Ms. Gross.Baguettes are fueling a similar creative zeal today. Austin, Texas designer Nak Armstrong transforms untraditionally trapezoid-shaped, tapered baguettes, into a \u201cpleated, ruffled, ruched look, like you would see in fabric.\u201d He views the cut as a challenge of sorts. \u201cSome people let the stone tell them how they should design the piece,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to whip them into shape and turn them into something else.\u201dDesigner       Suzanne Kalandjian,        founder of Suzanne Kalan, started using baguettes six years ago, but her designs initially met with resistance. \u201cBaguettes are [sharp-cornered] and not as shiny as round diamonds,\u201d said Ms. Kalandjian. Customers looking for edgier jewelry cottoned to her pieces immediately, but more conventional stores, she said, \u201ctook a bit longer.\u201d Today, her collection, which merges the romance of diamonds with spiky, geometric forms, is almost fully baguette-focused. It\u2019s carried in places such as Neiman Marcus and Dover Street Market.\u2018\u2018It has a clean look that makes a statement without all the chatter.\u2019\u2019Baguettes can, of course, be used in elaborate traditional pieces, like the Bulgari necklace pictured here, but they also appeal to jewelry minimalists who might not usually consider diamonds. \u201cThe cut has a clean, architectural look that makes a statement without all the chatter,\u201d said Greek designer Ileana Makri, whose current collection features her signature \u201cevil eye\u201d pieces rendered in baguette diamonds as well as a necklace featuring an inverse pyramid of baguettes.The simplicity of the cut, however, belies its technical challenges. The cut shows all flaws, \u201clike clear water\u201d said Ms. Makri, so high-quality stones are a must. Setting can also be a challenge, due to the crisp corners.Yet that\u2019s clearly not keeping jewelers from enthusiastically using the stones, particularly designers like Ms. Kalandjian who are banking on the cut\u2019s popularity. She, however, is confidently unbothered. \u201cIn the beginning people thought they were trendy,\u201d said jeweler Ms. Kalandjian. \u201cBut they\u2019re here to stay.

That growth rate exceeded analysts\u2019 average expectation of about 3.3%, according to Pivotal Research Group.Organic revenue was up 0.2% in North America, 9.3% in the U.K., 7.8% in Europe, 7.1% in Asia Pacific, 5% in Latin America and 20% in the Middle East and Africa.Rival Publicis Groupe SA, which reported earnings earlier in the day, struck a different tone. The French firm said it had improved performance in its North America operations thanks to new business wins from companies such as             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Inc.However, the company\u2019s newly installed CEO       Arthur Sadoun       said it is too early to tell whether the ad market in the U.S. is turning a corner after a weak first quarter that set the scene for a potentially tough year.On Omnicom\u2019s call, Mr. Wren also updated Wall Street on ongoing issues between Madison Avenue and YouTube, saying that problems with ads appearing alongside controversial content have yet to be fully resolved.\u201cThe testing that we\u2019ve done and marketers have done indicated that there are still challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that those challenges will get resolved over a period of time.\u201dThe overall outlook for Madison Avenue remains cloudy. Ad companies are dealing with major slowdowns in industries that they have long relied upon for growth, such as consumers-goods giants and retailers. Those sectors are putting additional pressure on ad firms to reduce the fees they pay for services.Last week, Pivotal Research Group reduced its long-term organic revenue growth expectations for ad companies such as WPP PLC, Omnicom, Publicis and Interpublic Group of Cos.Ad companies have been able to generate 4% organic growth annually between 2010 and 2015, but Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal, now expects annual growth rates of about 2.5% for the ad firms moving forward.The firm cited a long list of challenges that the sector is facing, including marketers experiencing slower growth, companies continuing to cut the fees they pay agencies, and growing competition from consulting firms. Another challenge has been brands cracking down on nontransparent practices in the ad-buying sector\u2014practices which had helped drive up agencies\u2019 margins in recent years.Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/omnicom-strikes-cautious-note-on-earnings-amid-economic-political-uncertainty-in-u-s-1500569142", "keywords": ["Omnicom Group,OMC,regulation,government policy,financial performance,earnings,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,public relations,business,consumer services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 12:41:00", "news_title": "\u2018Gone: The Forgotten Women of Ohio\u2019 Review: Unvarnished Stories of the Lost", "content": "From       Jack the Ripper       on down through the dank, dismal history of serial murder, the perpetrators always seem to have their macabre signatures and twisted proclivities while their victims seem sadly the same: anonymous members of an underclass; underprivileged people who\u2019ll go largely unmissed. Ordinarily, the dead are women murdered by men. Often enough, they\u2019re prostitutes. (      Aileen Wuornos,        a notable exception to the gender rule, was a prostitute.) In our time, the still-at-large Gilgo Beach Killer may have left as many as 17 women dead on Long Island. Who besides their mothers can name one?Gone: The Forgotten Women of OhioBegins Saturday, 9 p.m., SpikeIt\u2019s a credit to \u201cGone: The Forgotten Women of Ohio,\u201d directed by the Emmy-winning, Oscar-nominated       Joe Berlinger,        that the women of the title are afforded actual identities. They are memorable, in their way\u2014unseen characters in the drama despite the unfortunate commonalities that link them all together. One can hope that all those interconnecting facts will lead to a solution over the next eight weeks, though after watching the first three episodes\u2014each of which was more intense that the last\u2014this viewer wasn\u2019t even clear that a serial killer is at work. Not a human one, at any rate: \u201cThe real killer here,\u201d says public health nurse       Lisa Roberts,        \u201cis probably opiates.\u201dOne suspects Mr. Berlinger knew as much. A key figure in the documentary renaissance of the 1990s, the New York-based director spent the better part of two decades with filmmaking partner       Bruce Sinofsky       on the \u201cParadise Lost\u201d trilogy, which helped resolve the scandalous and allegedly \u201csatanic\u201d West Memphis Three murder case in evangelical Arkansas. (Mr. Sinofsky died in 2015.) In many ways, \u201cGone\u201d provides him familiar territory: Chillicothe is referred to as \u201cquintessential small-town America,\u201d and maybe it is, but it has an intractable underclass, is scarred by unemployment and poverty and\u2014like many similarly afflicted places in America\u2014is plagued by a heroin epidemic born of opiate abuse. All the women who\u2019ve been victimized in Chillicothe have been involved in the drug trade, and prostitution, and most got into heroin through a reliance on pain medication. They all have children. And mourning families. And, as viewers will learn, the same circle of acquaintances.What have the police made of all this? Not much, as Mr. Berlinger very diplomatically points out, as he goes about his own investigation, assisted by forensic intelligence analyst       Angela Clemente       (who appeared in Mr. Berlinger\u2019s 2014 \u201cWhitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger). The two are joined a bit later by former FBI profiler       Steve Bongardt,        and the trio makes efforts to figure out why a city of about 22,000 people could have so many unsolved deaths and disappearances in only an 18-month period, beginning in 2014..One death, that of Shasta Himelrick, has been ruled a suicide, but why, Ms. Clemente asks very sensibly, would a strong swimmer throw herself off a bridge into freezing water at the end of December? (Especially, she implies, when there are so many drugs around to make the task more pleasant.) One victim is shot; several are discovered in water. But as the team admits to itself, nothing suggests the profile of a psychopath. When the news hits that a real serial murderer,       Neal Falls,        has been shot and killed by a woman he\u2019s attacked in nearby West Virginia, his methodology is examined, and what\u2019s made clear to the viewer is that the Chillicothe events are somewhere outside the criminology textbooks.It is perhaps predictable that the families of the victims would complain of police incompetence and worse, but there are also signs that the efforts of the various investigators have lacked a certain, shall we say, urgency. \u201cI can\u2019t know everything,\u201d says Chillicothe Sgt.       Lucas Hansen,        and no he can\u2019t. Individually, the officers seem forthcoming: Chillicothe Detective       Bud Lytle,        for instance, is more than happy to share information and appear on camera with Mr. Berlinger, but he\u2019s never really pressed (not during episodes 1-3, at least) about the families\u2019 accusations.As whodunits go, \u201cGone\u201d is not \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d It\u2019s untidy, and its people are as erratic as its facts. Explaining why he\u2019s undertaking a task at which the police have thus far failed, Mr. Berlinger says, \u201ca camera can open doors.\u201d That\u2019s true. But a camera can also change behavior, and a viewer can\u2019t help wondering how much the characters in the Chillicothe drama are influenced by the presence of Mr. Berlinger and his team, how much is natural and unguarded and how much is pure performance. The Chillicothe case has attracted cameras before, and the sense is that the clock was ticking. Given the choice, Mr. Berlinger would likely have spent more time among the people there, and gotten them more at ease.Class is an unavoidable issue here and, to his credit, Mr. Berlinger doesn\u2019t try to avoid it. \u201cGone\u201d travels between the earthy environs of Chillicothe and Mr. Berlinger\u2019s home base, the stylish offices of Radical Media in New York. The contrast isn\u2019t exactly jarring, but it\u2019s impossible to ignore. \u201cComing to this region has been an eye-opener for me,\u201d Mr. Berlinger tells one of the locals, and he\u2019s not talking only about the opioid crisis and its insidious side effects. He\u2019s talking about the way of life, the culture. It\u2019s an honest thing to say. It\u2019s an uncomfortable way to feel.The debut episode of \u201cGone: The Forgotten Women of Ohio\u201d is, like many an opening chapter of anything, less electrifying than what is to follow, since it needs to establish people, dates, stories and characters. Mr. Berlinger is not the most confident narrator, and he takes some getting used to. But by episode 2 \u201cGone\u201d is out of the gate and the viewer, we suspect, fully engaged. I, for one, will be tuning in for episodes 4-8 because \u201cGone\u201d is that genuinely rare thing on TV: unpredictable.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gone-the-forgotten-women-of-ohio-review-unvarnished-stories-of-the-lost-1500568890", "keywords": ["arts in review, chillicothe,gone, joe berlinger, spike, television, the forgotten women of ohio, true crime,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,rampage,serial killings,murder,manslaughter,social issues,television,radio,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 12:41:00", "news_title": "Chris Froome Is Poised to Win the Tour de France, Again", "content": "BRIAN\u00c7ON, France\u2014The Tour de France is now Chris Froome\u2019s to lose.It took Froome longer to reach this point than in past summers here, but few doubts remain that it has arrived. With grim, stone-faced efficiency, the three-time champion contained his nearest rivals Romain Bardet and Rigoberto Uran and all but etched his name on the trophy on the Tour\u2019s final day in the high Alps. Only two stages remain before the ceremonial cruise to the finish in Paris\u2014and neither should trip up Froome on his way to Tour No. 4.Friday\u2019s exercise is a long ride into Provence that isn\u2019t quite bumpy enough for any of the general classification contenders to escape Froome and his Team Sky cohort. And Saturday is a short time-trial in Marseille, where Froome will be among the quickest.\u201cI\u2019m very happy to get through the Alps without any problems this year,\u201d Froome said after stepping off the podium. \u201cIt\u2019s normally the part I find most difficult.\u201dIt might have been, if the day\u2019s final climb hadn\u2019t proved such an anticlimax. Thursday\u2019s stage was set for an explosive three-way fight between Froome, Bardet and Uran, but no one had the legs to mount a decisive attack. Bardet\u2019s efforts to close the overall gap only earned him four seconds, putting him in second place, six seconds ahead of Uran.\u201cI really gave everything,\u201d Bardet said. \u201cI know this climb well and I knew it was going to hurt.\u201dThe problem for the men chasing Froome is that neither will be able to touch him in the time-trial.Now, barring any catastrophes, the debate will begin over the manner of Froome\u2019s third consecutive Tour success and fourth overall. Should his performance in the time-trial prove only excellent instead of brilliant, he could become only the seventh man to win the Tour de France without taking a single stage victory.How is this possible? Froome\u2019s teammates have put him precisely where he needed to be at nearly every moment of this race. On Thursday, he had Mikel Landa\u2014strong enough to be a team leader in his own right\u2014to shepherd him up the 10% gradients of the Col d\u2019Izoard. Bardet and Uran, meanwhile, were fighting through the final climb without a teammate\u2019s wheel to follow.They could only stare at the back of Team Sky and Froome\u2019s yellow jersey.Write to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chris-froome-is-poised-to-win-the-tour-de-france-again-1500568753", "keywords": ["cycling,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 12:38:00", "news_title": "Don\u2019t Be That Guy: Avoiding Over-40 Style Pitfalls", "content": "CALL IT GUTSY or foolish, but as a younger man I was prone to taking the occasional fashion risk. When I was 30, for example, a pair of black leather pants spoke to me. I mean they actually made a sound when I pulled them on in the dressing room, that satisfying twisting noise of leather in motion. They also smelled like a catcher\u2019s mitt and bulked up my thighs so that walking in them was a minor undertaking. But dressing outside my comfort zone had the pleasant effect of estranging me slightly from myself, of magnifying my boldness. (Then again, I bought the pants at Gap, the daring purveyor of the Pocket-T. So not all that risky.)Ten years later, I was still at it. At 40, I fell prey to that illusion, perpetuated briefly in the aughts, that urban western wear was not as embarrassing as previously thought, and got myself a blue straw cowboy hat. I promptly took the hat on a weekend to Montauk\u2014a trip whose sole purpose was to introduce me to the best friends of my new significant other. The relationship lasted a long time but so did the story of my appearing poolside, mounting a lounge chair like a saddle and donning that stupid hat as if to say: No big deal, I\u2019m just wearing a blue cowboy hat at the pool\u2014why wouldn\u2019t I?I recently entered my 50s. As a newly single father with a school-age daughter, I\u2019m warier now about dressing outside the lines. Giving up, however, is never a stylish look. In California, where I live, sartorial surrender among older men often manifests as a field vest with its outer pockets drooping sadly like a basset hound\u2019s eyes, or head-to-toe Margaritaville wear, a look I like to call Forever 71. There has to be a middle state, neither embarrassed nor embalmed in which over-40 men can live and look sharp. And don\u2019t believe that old chestnut about men becoming distinguished as they age no matter what they wear, as if by default rather than effort. It\u2019s total crap. Not everyone grows older like the Trivago guy or Flea.So you do actually have to try, but I\u2019ve learned through trial and glaring error that it\u2019s best to proceed with stealth, precision and caution. I\u2019m suspicious of most trends, especially as men\u2019s fashion skews increasingly more casual (sneakers posited as appropriate wedding-guest attire) or florid (chinoiserie embroidery; anything from Gucci). Colors other than manly army greens and universally condoned blues work best in small doses, though not as cowboy hats. And if you don\u2019t submit daily to the form of group torture called CrossFit, I\u2019d avoid anything clingy or flimsy; softer bodies need the flattering armor of weightier fabrics. (See \u201cGetting It Right\u201d below for more advice.) I avoid the new array of ethereal shirts made of ever more gauzy, practically mist-like materials. Similarly lacking in structure are sweatpants attempting to stand in for jeans. Worst of all: drop-crotch \u201charem\u201d sweatpants. I can\u2019t be the only guy my age looking for clothes with substance and few, if any, concubine connotations.Turns out I am not. Take Michael Engleman, the mid-40s executive vice president of entertainment marketing and brand innovation at TBS and TNT in Los Angeles. He\u2019s also husband of comedy writer Jessi Klein and a busy new dad. His time crunch led him to try Seize sur Vingt, a clothier specializing in custom tailoring that started as a small shop in New York\u2019s Nolita neighborhood, and has since expanded to sell within its own multi-brand menswear shop in Manhattan called Groupe and L.A. men\u2019s boutique Avedon. \u201cNow they have my measurements,\u201d he said. \u201cI picked the fabrics. They sent me a couple of shirts and a suit. Done.\u201d This route is a bit beyond my means, but I envy him the opportunity to specify materials that aren\u2019t onionskin thin and to get the fit right every time, neither too voluminous nor too vacuum-sealed\u2014both of which defeat an older guy\u2019s bid for style.\u2018\u2018Never mistake someone\u2019s telling you how young you look for a compliment.\u2019\u2019Michael Souter, 64, founder of Souter/Partners, a luxury branding firm in New York with clients such as Givenchy and Issey Miyake, still has a functioning relationship with fashion but knows the value of restraint. His livelihood, after all, relies on the subtlety of his taste. \u201cOne of the few rules I have,\u201d he said, \u201cis to avoid anything with a youth message on it.\u201d I think guiltily of my Marquette University sweatshirts and, more embarrassingly, of the fact that I only recently edited from my wardrobe a \u201cVote for Pedro\u201d ringer T-shirt. \u201cAlso, avoid hair dye,\u201d added Mr. Souter. It should be mentioned that he has a full head of thick, naturally non-gray hair. He is less strict about other practices, such as \u201cwearing a young jean or too fun a sock,\u201d stating only that they should be \u201cminimized.\u201d Fashion insiders, I\u2019ve noticed, favor the collective singular (\u201cjean,\u201d \u201csock\u201d), dropping that final \u201cs\u201d like it\u2019s completely out of style.\u201cOr a pleated short,\u201d I offered gamely.\u201cAny shorts,\u201d he said, reinstating the last \u201cs\u201d in shorts, perhaps as a slight admonition about who gets to use the lingo and when. \u201cThe important thing to remember is: Never mistake someone\u2019s telling you how young you look for a compliment. It is not.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cNo. Only old people are told they look young, and it is usually when their strategy is showing. Shoot for looking good, not young.\u201dIn my childhood, my father used a hair tonic called Vitalis, which supposedly made hair shiny minus the greasiness of Brylcreem. Though it failed completely to tame my dense curls when I gave it a try, its name hinted at a quality that still defines many of the well-dressed men I admire. When I\u2019m 60 and beyond, I\u2019d like to emulate those older guys who have a healthy respect for the open question. Men who know that the real fountain of youth lies in maintaining a lively curiosity about what life might yet bring. Who, when they\u2019re getting dressed, leave room for unpredictability.I hope that, even if I\u2019m just getting dressed to take the garbage out, I\u2019ll still be open to the possibility that I could bump into that attractive neighbor who right at that moment might be walking down an adjacent driveway.

Nowadays he\u2019s all about Gucci\u2019s noisily cutting-edge clothes and droopy-necked T-shirts that expose his salt-and-pepper chest hair.Finding a great-fitting suit is a foolproof style solution for the professional. This gentleman, however, is still wearing his suit one-and-a-half sizes too big, accessorized by slicked-back hair and a fulsome pocket square, like an extra from the 1987 film, \u201cWall Street.\u201dThey\u2019re safe. They\u2019re easy. They\u2019re comfortable. Dad jeans certainly have their allure. But wearing them can also telegraph the message that you\u2019ve given up. This paterfamilias has lazily added a too-big polo shirt, a freebie baseball cap and drugstore sunglasses.When it comes to more mature guys with spare tires, we don\u2019t recommend wearing a \u201cThe Strokes\u201d T-shirt in 2017. And you might want to leave the man-buns to the promising 20-something subway buskers.

Berlin says the accusations against him are unfounded.Government officials were meeting Thursday to discuss possible actions. In addition to the escalated alert, Foreign Minister       Sigmar Gabriel       said the country must reassess a key program guaranteeing companies\u2019 investments in Turkey and questioned plans to expand the decades-old customs union between the European Union and Turkey.\u201cWe have to come to a realignment of our Turkey policy,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on as before. We must be clearer than before so that those in charge in Ankara understand such a policy is not without consequences.\u201dGermany is Turkey\u2019s leading trade partner and largest export market for Turkish products. There are more than 6,000 German companies active in almost every sector in Turkey and about 100,000 Turkish-German businesses operating in Turkey, according to Turkish government statistics. Germany exported \u20ac21.9 billion ($25.2 billion) in goods to Turkey last year, and imports from Turkey reached \u20ac15.4 billion, according to German government statistics.German companies expressed concern about the plans. Germany\u2019s DIHK chambers of commerce said it expects trade between the countries to decline by 10%.\u201cInvestment will also continue to suffer from this,\u201d Germany\u2019s BGA export group said in a statement. \u201cThis is actually an escalation we couldn\u2019t have imagined and which is bitter for all involved.\u201dGermans are one of the largest segments in Turkey\u2019s tourism industry, with approximately 5.5 million visitors coming to Turkey each year.A spokesman for Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       characterized the remarks as aimed at voters ahead of Germany\u2019s September general election. \u201cUnfortunately, this has become fashionable in Germany,\u201d Ibrahim Kalin said.Turkey\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that a serious crisis of confidence is brewing with Germany, despite close and friendly ties between the nations.The ministry said Germany has a double standard, repeating Turkey\u2019s long held grievance that Germany allegedly gives supporters of the \u200bKurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, and \u200bsupporters of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Mr. Erdogan has accused of masterminding a botched coup against his rule last summer, a haven, despite Turkey\u2019s requests to extradite or arrest them. Both the U.S. and Turkey have designated the PKK as a terrorist group.\u201cWhile German authorities are preventing our ministers and lawmakers from meeting with our citizens in Germany, they expect German lawmakers close to the [PKK] terror organization can visit our sovereign military bases whenever they want to as their right,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Gabriel called on Turkey to enter what he called a \u201creal dialogue\u201d on the basis of European values.\u201cWe continue to be interested in good relations with Turkey that are built on trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want Turkey to become a part of the West or remain part of it where it already is. But it takes two to tango.\u201dBerlin and Ankara have traditionally close ties because Germany is home to the largest Turkish diaspora in the world and both countries are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.But Berlin has limited room to maneuver. Germany relies on a pact with Turkey that has drastically reduced the inflows of migrants from the Middle East since the summer of 2015, which caused a political crisis for the chancellor because Turkey is the main transit route to Europe.Turkish police on July 5 arrested 10 Amnesty International activists, including German citizen Peter Steudtner, who had gathered in Turkey for what the organization called a routine workshop. Six of the activists have been jailed pending trial on charges of aiding a terror group.A German official on Wednesday said Ankara had provided Germany with a list of prominent German companies it says support terrorism, including car maker             Daimler AG       and pharmaceutical company             BASF SE.A spokesman for BASF declined to comment. Daimler spokeswoman Ute W\u00fcest von Vellberg said the company hadn\u2019t seen the list and declined to comment further.Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek rejected the claim. \u201cPress reports that Turkey is investigating Daimler AG and BASF SE are completely false,\u201d he said on his official twitter account. \u201cWe welcome German investors.\u201d\u2014Margaret Coker and       Christian Grimm       contributed to this article.Write to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-to-take-new-steps-over-turkey-arrest-1500549886", "keywords": ["ankara,crackdown,germany-turkey,human rights,ministry of foreign affairs,pkk,relations,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 12:31:00", "news_title": "Lack of Progress at U.S.-China Talks  Raises Stakes for Trump   ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014High-level economic talks between the U.S. and China ended Wednesday without any concrete agreement or future agenda, leaving the       Trump       administration\u2019s efforts to recast trade ties with Beijing in limbo.After a full day of bilateral meetings, the U.S. side issued a terse statement saying that \u201cChina acknowledged our shared objective to reduce the trade deficit which both sides will work cooperatively to achieve.\u201dThe statement from Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       and Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       didn\u2019t provide further details on just how much the two sides could agree on, or when they would resume talks.Chinese officials painted a rosier picture of Wednesday\u2019s talks, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang describing them as \u201cinnovative, practical and constructive,\u201d though he reiterated China\u2019s displeasure at recent U.S. actions, including arms sales to Taiwan. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry didn\u2019t immediately comment on the outcome of the dialogue.U.S. and Chinese officials agreed that \u201cone of the solutions to address the trade imbalance is for the United States to expand its exports to China, instead of reducing imports from China,\u201d Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said in remarks reported by the official Xinhua News Agency. Beijing is also urging Washington to lift export controls that curb sales of high-tech products to China, Mr. Zhu said.The failure to take specific steps to close America\u2019s $347 billion trade deficit with China\u201470% of the U.S. global imbalance\u2014raises pressure on the Trump administration to consider shifting from its embrace of cooperation with Beijing toward more confrontation.Trump aides have been weighing a series of tougher trade policies toward China, from new import barriers on steel and solar panels, to tighter restrictions on investments, but have so far chosen not to implement them.People familiar with Wednesday\u2019s talks said that American negotiators tried, unsuccessfully, to use the threat of new steel tariffs to force the Chinese to commit to specific benchmarks for cutting the country\u2019s mammoth production overcapacity in that sector, a big factor dragging down steel prices globally.The meetings were held to mark the end of a 100-day period that President Donald Trump and Chinese President       Xi Jinping       had set to come up with a comprehensive plan to reset commercial ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The lack of any announced plan means they failed to meet that self-imposed deadline.The decision to issue a statement from just the U.S. side was a break with past practices after similar negotiations held in recent years during the       Obama       and       Bush       administrations. In the past, both countries issued common statements summarizing what they had discussed, emphasizing areas of agreement\u2014and usually issuing a list of sector-specific market-opening pledges from China. It was also a contrast with the more amicable joint statement given by Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi during an April Florida summit where they agreed to launch a \u201cComprehensive Economic Dialogue.\u201d\u201cMany expected at the 100-day point we would have much more substantive points of progress,\u201d said       Nicholas Lardy,        a China scholar at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He added that the lack of agreement on even modest measures is a sign that U.S.-China relations \u201care very uncertain and subject to very high risks.\u201dPeople familiar with the talks said a major sticking point was a demand from the American negotiators to craft a concrete plan, with benchmarks and a timetable, for reducing China\u2019s trade surplus with the U.S.\u201cThe administration wanted to put some numerical targets in place and I know China was uncomfortable with that,\u201d said       Myron Brilliant,        the U.S. Chamber of Commerce executive vice president for international affairs.More than his predecessors, Mr. Trump has focused not just on removing barriers to American exports, but on trying to curb America\u2019s trade deficit, which he has said is a concrete sign of flawed policies. Many economists say Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on trade deficits with individual countries is ill-conceived because deficits are driven in large part by macroeconomic factors beyond the control of trade negotiators, like national saving and investment patterns.Chinese Vice Premier       Wang Yang,        who headed his delegation, opened Wednesday\u2019s talks by saying that the economic teams from both countries \u201chave worked around the clock and have held over 60 rounds of working consultations\u201d since the Florida summit to prepare for this week\u2019s session. He portrayed those discussions as more \u201cintense\u201d than intricate negotiations surrounding China\u2019s joining the World Trade Organization in 2001.People familiar with the discussions said American negotiators had been optimistic going into the meetings that they could announce some kind of accords on Chinese regulation of data at multinational companies\u2014a major complaint of U.S. firms doing business there\u2014easing restrictions on foreign auto makers, curbing Chinese agricultural subsidies, and addressing Chinese steel overcapacity.The stall in economic talks mirrors a similarly rough patch in the Trump administration\u2019s diplomatic ties with Beijing. In the weeks since the Mar-a-Lago summit, Mr. Trump rebuffed Chinese objections in approving news arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province, and sent bombers and naval patrols this month to the South China Sea to assert American freedom to navigate those contested waters. Mr. Trump also tightened economic sanctions against companies and banks allegedly doing businesses aiding North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.The North Korea issue in particular may affect Mr. Trump\u2019s economic approach to China. The president said earlier that he would give China some leeway on trade in return for Beijing\u2019s help curbing Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. He has since said he was disappointed with China\u2019s efforts, which may make him feel freer to yield the trade club.\u201cIn terms of North Korea, our strength is trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week.Beijing hadn\u2019t been likely to grant major concessions to Washington even without recent irritants in the relationship, according to       Huo Jianguo,        a former Chinese trade official turned researcher.\u201cLarge gaps still exist between the U.S. and China in terms of their economic interests, and there\u2019s little consensus on an approach toward bridging those differences,\u201d said Mr. Huo, vice chairman of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies. \u201cBoth sides still need to time to adjust their mentalities.\u201dThe Trump team early on expressed optimism that it had found a new formula for solving nettlesome trade tensions where prior administrations had failed. In May, as part of a quick down payment, the two governments announced agreement on Chinese market-opening measures in agriculture and finance, with a Chinese pledge to deliver concrete results before this week\u2019s meetings.But some U.S. business groups and affected companies have complained that while China has met the letter of its pledges, it has failed to live up to the spirit of them, removing the promised trade barriers, while leaving other impediments in place.A new tiff flared up this week when             Dow Chemical Co.       said China had appeared to renege on a promise to provide an expedited review of its genetically modified soybean crops as part of the May pledge to accelerate approval of eight stalled biotechnology products.The Chinese government said there had been a misunderstanding and that the Dow product hadn\u2019t been on its priority clearance list.Some American business leaders worry that the stalled talks could create new uncertainty and instability in bilateral economic ties.\u201cWe are disappointed the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue ended at an apparent impasse,\u201d       John Frisbie,        president of the US-China Business Council, said. \u201cIt is important for governments to take tangible steps to address longstanding issues and ensure the commercial relationship remains a source of stability in the overall relationship.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Myron Brilliant is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce executive vice president for international affairs.

Such planning is always subject to the whims of the volatile IPO market.Should Apollo pull it off, the IPO would mark a quick turnaround for the private-equity firm, which began consolidating home-security providers two years ago. The New York firm bought Protection 1 and ASG Security simultaneously in 2015, put them together, and then used the combined company to acquire ADT for about $7 billion last year.\u00a0The former competitors were jointly valued at about $15 billion, including debt, Apollo said in May of last year.The fact that Apollo is already teeing up a sale is surprising and indicates the investment could prove to be lucrative.Private-equity firms routinely buy a company intending to use it as a vehicle for additional acquisitions, but they rarely do so at such a quick pace and on such a scale. The deals have already started to pay off. In February, an ADT unit sold $800 million in debt to finance a dividend to its owners.ADT makes security products ranging from burglar-alarm systems to wireless cameras for homes and businesses. It has worked to position itself as a player in the so-called smart-home market, which aims to connect consumers wirelessly to various household devices.ADT was once part of the former Tyco conglomerate assembled by       L. Dennis Kozlowski.       ADT had merged with Tyco in the late 1990s in a roughly $5 billion deal. Tyco used ADT\u2019s Bermuda domicile to relocate abroad and lower its tax rate. In 2012, Tyco spun off ADT to shareholders in an effort to refocus the sprawling conglomerate\u2019s operations.Apollo, based in New York, was founded by veterans of junk-bond pioneer Drexel Burnham Lambert. The firm is known for its willingness to make aggressive, sometimes contrarian, bets. Apollo recently raised $23.5 billion for the world\u2019s largest-ever buyout fund.IPO activity has picked up this year, with 94 companies raising $28.5 billion on U.S. exchanges, according to Dealogic. That is nearly triple the volume at this point last year, when 48 companies had raised $10.6 billion amid the worst new-issue drought in more than a decade.

Don\u2019t Eat There", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Justice       Neil Gorsuch       survived a Senate grilling to get his seat on the Supreme Court. Now, as the court\u2019s most-junior member, he\u2019s the chief justice of the grill.Tradition dictates that each newcomer to the nation\u2019s highest tribunal must serve on the committee that oversees the court\u2019s cafeteria, a 185-seat facility open to the public on the building\u2019s ground floor.It isn\u2019t a job that justices relish.\u201cThere\u2019s not much one can do to make the fare better,\u201d says Justice       Ruth Bader Ginsburg.       The committee is \u201ca truly disheartening assignment.\u201dJustice Gorsuch arrives at the cafeteria as something of a stealth candidate. President Donald Trump, despite running several restaurants in his hotel empire, selected a judge with practically no food-service experience.The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where Justice Gorsuch previously sat, has no cafeteria in its Denver courthouse. He avoided signaling his culinary philosophy during confirmation hearings in March.\u201cThe Senate overlooked that,\u201d laments retired Justice John Paul Stevens, who first dined in the cafeteria as a law clerk in the 1940s.The windowless cafeteria, decorated with photos of the Supreme Court, offers a range of items, including hamburgers ($5.70; cheese is 30 cents extra), chicken tenders ($5), sweet potato fries ($2.30) and two soups a day. This week\u2019s specials included a grilled portobello sandwich ($6.70). Employees get a 20% discount, but a frequent-diner rewards program was discontinued after a trial period last year.Justice Gorsuch had no appetite for discussing his cafeteria plans, but he\u2019s clearly in the pressure cooker. There are no other eateries within convenient walking distance, making the cafeteria an essential ingredient in staff morale. Not only do the court\u2019s 400-plus employees depend on the facility, cafeteria proceeds subsidize staff enrichment activities like the spring cookout, the Christmas party and Supreme Court night at the Washington Nationals ballpark.Raising the stakes, he takes over from a celebrated incumbent.\u201cJustice [Elena] Kagan succeeded in getting a new frozen yogurt machine in the cafeteria,\u201d Chief Justice       John Roberts       reported to a judicial conference in 2011. \u201cNo one at the court can remember any of the prior justices on the committee doing anything.\u201dDespite lifetimes spent salivating over a seat on the high court, most new justices find themselves unprepared for the challenge of running the cafeteria, which long has been dogged by a reputation for mediocre food and a perennial struggle to turn a profit.Cafeteria duty is a recipe for \u201cbringing them back down to earth after the excitement of confirmation and appointment,\u201d the chief justice, who typically orders a salad, continued.Message received, said Justice Kagan. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very good cafeteria, so this is really just the opportunity they have to kind of haze you all the time. Like, \u2018Argh, you know, Elena, this food isn\u2019t very good,\u2019\u201d she said at a Princeton University talk in 2014.Justice Stephen Breyer, the court\u2019s junior member from 1994 to 2006, holds the record for cafeteria service. It is \u201ca very sensitive topic,\u201d he said when asked about lunch during a 2007 appearance on \u201cWait, Wait\u2026Don\u2019t Tell Me!,\u201d an NPR quiz show.A salad bar expansion notwithstanding, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I was a great success in that position,\u201d Justice Breyer told host Peter Sagal.Looking back today, \u201cthe most difficult challenge was to help promote service that would satisfy many different cafeteria users with many different tastes,\u201d Justice Breyer says. \u201cAfter 11 years, I left that challenge to my successors.\u201dWhen President Ronald Reagan appointed the first woman to the court, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, in 1981, Chief Justice Warren Burger responded by assigning her to the cafeteria committee. Each junior justice since has been stuck with the chore, serving alongside a half-dozen rank- and-file court employees to discuss menu items, set prices and air customer complaints.Unlike the Supreme Court itself, which meets a floor above, the cafeteria committee operates by consensus, with nary a dissent noted, former members say. In an otherwise hierarchical institution, it represents an oasis of egalitarianism. \u201cWe\u2019re all equal when we\u2019re having lunch,\u201d says Justice       Samuel Alito,        who served from 2006 to 2009.\u201cI thought it was pretty good, under my supervision,\u201d Justice Alito says of the cafeteria. Official records confirm the committee received \u201ccompliments on the shrimp bisque soup and the hummus and broccoli.\u201dStill, the Alito years also saw disaffection over slow service and unhappiness about the removal of pudding parfait. Fellow justices piled on, Justice Alito recalls. One complained there was too much salt in the oatmeal, another said the turkey wrap needed more mayonnaise.He declined to identify the justices involved, invoking the court\u2019s little-known \u201ccafeteria privilege.\u201dThe biggest source of indigestion in those days was the coffee, records say. Justice Alito says he tackled that problem by finding a new vendor. There were \u201cmany compliments on the delicious new coffee,\u201d he says.Justice       Sonia Sotomayor,        who took over in 2009, often clashes with Justice Alito on major issues before the court. Coffee proved no exception.\u201cI thought it was horrible,\u201d she says. She sought to overturn Justice Alito\u2019s decision, but a taste test among diners sustained his coffee judgment. \u201cIt stayed,\u201d she says.That was but one frustration of her tenure. To confront chronic service delays, she proposed enlarging the kitchen. The idea went nowhere.\u201cEverybody in the building is deferential to a justice,\u201d she said. \u201cThey never say no, but they explain why it can\u2019t be done.\u201dMore heartburn came in 2010, when the Washington Post ran a series reviewing government cafeterias. The House of Representatives came in first, with a grade of A. The Patent and Trademark Office, the Pentagon and the State Department each got a C, while the Agriculture Department and the National Institutes of Health barely passed with D\u2019s.Then came the Supreme Court. \u201cThis food should be unconstitutional,\u201d the paper said, citing a \u201cfalling-apart mushy\u201d veggie burger and a salmon rice bowl that \u201cbears no resemblance to any salmon I\u2019ve tasted before.\u201d Grade: F.\u201cI got a note from the chief justice the next day,\u201d Justice Sotomayor says. \u201cIt said: \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019\u201dWrite to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearings were in March.

The European Central Bank is playing for time on extreme monetary policy. But markets know a decision on winding down its bond-purchase program can\u2019t be put off forever.The main message from ECB President       Mario Draghi       Thursday was that nothing had been decided about the pace or duration of purchases, currently running at \u20ac60 billion a month until the end of 2017. He did say that discussions on the topic would take place in the fall\u2014but also that policy makers had been unanimous in not setting a precise date for when to talk about potential changes. And he underlined that the ECB has been able to find flexibility within the program when needed. That is aimed at watering down the idea that constraints on bond supply mean the program\u2019s withdrawal is inevitable.The ECB would clearly like to avoid an over-reaction by financial markets \u2014Mr. Draghi said an unwarranted tightening of conditions \u201cwas the last thing we may want.\u201dBut investors are currently hypersensitive to even slight changes in tone. Bund yields and the euro initially fell when the ECB\u2019s policy statement showed it retaining the option to do more asset purchases if needed\u2014 a potentially dovish signal. But they then rose again as Mr. Draghi in his press conference was upbeat on growth, and didn\u2019t sound too worried about the rise in yields and the euro that has occurred in the past few weeks. Markets took that as a green light: In the end, the euro rose decisively above $1.16, reaching its highest since January 2015.It isn\u2019t clear, however, that the ECB\u2019s decision will be any easier in the fall than it might be now. While the growth picture in the eurozone is strong, Mr. Draghi was forced to acknowledge that inflation \u201cis not where we want it to be.\u201d The latest reading showed headline inflation at 1.3% in June, and little sign of upward pressure on underlying measures. But Mr. Draghi reiterated that there was confidence that the economic expansion would lift inflation toward the ECB\u2019s aim of \u201cbelow, but close to\u201d 2%.The ECB\u2019s ambiguity about its intentions have helped keep market pressures contained in the short-term. While the euro and bond yields have moved, there\u2019s been little in the way of repercussions into other asset classes. If this is a taper tantrum, it\u2019s on a small scale so far.The focus will now move swiftly to Mr. Draghi\u2019s appearance at the Federal Reserve\u2019s Jackson Hole conference at the end of August, where his speech will be scrutinized for any hints on how the ECB will execute its exit plans.

But the helicopter comes in handy for short hops around his domain: 155,000 or so acres of mountains, rivers, buttes and forest spread patchwork across the West, amassed for his personal enjoyment at a cost of roughly $96 million.\u201cI\u2019ve always liked land. Every time I sold an oil and gas property, I would take some of the money and buy ranches,\u201d said Mr. Gordy, whose closets are full of camouflage clothing, grouped by season.His Double Arrow ranch\u2014a 48,000-acre spread outside Livingston, Mont.\u2014cost him more than $45 million. Mr. Gordy pointed out some landmarks while driving his all-terrain vehicle.\u201cThis is the Yellowstone River, my boundary line,\u201d he said, as herds of antelope sprinted past. He pointed to hot springs puffing out white steam, an old homesteader\u2019s cabin deep in a forest grove, and a mountain ridge with two towering rock cairns\u2014so-called sheepherders\u2019 monuments\u2014built in the 19th century. The ranch ends somewhere up in the Crazy Mountains, an island mountain range spanning 40 miles of the northern Rockies.Mr. Gordy, who presides over a Houston-based conglomerate of privately held partnerships that include energy, mineral and real-estate development businesses, bought his ranches through his family-owned Rock Creek Ranch limited partnership.Occasionally, he loses track of just how many he owns. The Montana ranch, for example, is an aggregate of 10 individual ranches. His Wyoming ranch has grown from its original 50,000 acres, purchased in 1993 for $5 million, to nearly 80,000 acres as he bought up neighboring ranches and parcels\u2014at a total cost of $23 million.\u201cIf the old families want to sell, most of them call me first,\u201d Mr. Gordy said. He also owns two ski homes in Utah\u2019s Deer Valley and an oceanfront retreat in the Bahamas, which he bought and redecorated as a surprise 60th birthday gift to his wife, Glenda, in 2011.The son of a Houston policeman and an office cleaner, Mr. Gordy traces his love for land back to his grandparents\u2019 40-acre farm in Louisiana, where he learned to hunt and fish. \u201cThey kept me from becoming a juvenile delinquent,\u201d said Mr. Gordy. He honed his marksmanship shooting wasps with his BB gun, while mooning over the hunting guns in his grandmother\u2019s Sears, Roebuck catalog. He now owns a museum-worthy collection of rare and antique rifles, guns and pistols.After working his way through college with stints as a garbage collector, a truck-loader and a roustabout, Mr. Gordy went to work in the oil industry. In 1981, he co-founded a small gas and oil exploration company, then sold the majority of it in 1985, before oil prices collapsed. \u201cMy grandfather used to say, \u2018If you give anybody luck, s\u2014 will do for brains,\u2019\u201d he said.Mr. Gordy bought up more oil fields while prices were low, then expanded into coal-bed methane drilling and minerals exploration. He formed a new company, RGGS Land & Minerals, when he acquired mineral rights from             U.S. Steel                   in 2004\u2014a deal that gave him control over the mineral rights to 1.5 million acres, he said.This spring, Mr. Gordy made his first foray into retail, opening Gordy & Sons Outfitters, a high-price hunting and fly-fishing store in Houston, with his sons Shaun and Garrett. Patrons can shop for handcrafted British Purdey guns, and try out rods at a casting pond stocked with imported Amazonian peacock bass.He also has moved into real-estate development with Buffalo Heights, a 4.8-acre mixed-use complex with an upscale grocery, offices and luxury apartments, now under construction in Houston. It is the first phase of development of a 23-acre site he owns.Mr. Gordy\u2019s first ranch purchase was a 113-acre parcel in East Texas, which he bought in 1982 for $78,000. \u201cWe were so excited\u2014it felt like it was just miles,\u201d said Ms. Gordy, a petite 65-year-old who works out with a punching bag.For years, the family stayed in a barn without electricity or running water, cooking on a woodstove and sleeping on mattresses on the floor, until a woodrat ran over Ms. Gordy\u2019s bed one night. She refused to return until her husband built a cabin with a bathroom.The East Texas ranch has since expanded to about 8,000 acres, at a total cost of about $10 million. Mr. Gordy, now negotiating for an additional 800 acres there, is transforming it into a quail plantation.He owns a larger ranch in southwest Texas called La Ceniza, a 19,000-acre spread he acquired in several chunks between 1998 and 2002 for about $18 million. Mr. Gordy built a $5 million hacienda-style manse there in 2004 as a hunting retreat for friends and family. \u201cEvery time I\u2019d come up with a plan, he\u2019d want it bigger,\u201d said Ms. Gordy, who designed the 15,000-square-foot house with a builder.Its centerpiece is a large trophy room with a big stone fireplace, game tables, a jukebox and a saloon-style bar. \u201cSouth Texas is a hunting paradise,\u201d said Mr. Gordy, who hunts quail, doves, wild pigs and deer there.Mr. Gordy\u2019s biggest ranch is his nearly 80,000-acre property on Wyoming\u2019s North Platte River\u2014with red stone buttes, mountains and lakes, and a 45-foot waterfall cascading down a box canyon.\u201cThere are six waterfalls on the ranch, but three are more slip \u2019n\u2019 slides,\u201d said Mr. Gordy, jumping in his helicopter to tour the property. \u201cWe could take a four-wheeler,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut to go all around the ranch would take a day, at least.\u201dWyoming is a working ranch\u2014as are all his ranches\u2014where he raises Black Angus cattle and quarter horses. He and his family take part in cattle branding and three-day cattle drives to the mountains.He also likes to hunt Hungarian partridge, bow-hunt for elk and fly-fish there and on his Montana ranch, where he sometimes takes friends to remote trout streams by helicopter.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t a large property, Russell wasn\u2019t interested in buying it,\u201d said Dave Palmerlee, a Wyoming-based buyer broker and attorney, who represented Mr. Gordy in the acquisition of the Montana ranch in 2002, negotiating with seven ranch families who had been there for generations. (Mr. Gordy has since bought three more.)Unlike many big ranches, which contain or encompass state-leased or federal land, there was very little public land involved\u2014a key issue for Mr. Gordy, who values privacy. \u201cI like people\u2014I just don\u2019t want to be around them,\u201d he said.The Gordys built a $15 million family compound in Montana in 2014, with a 13,000-square-foot main lodge designed by Locati Architects that overlooks the Absaroka Mountains. There are two adjoining homes for the Gordys\u2019 sons and their families.The ranch house is both rustic and grand, with walls of Montana moss rock, reclaimed old timbers, and high stenciled ceilings. The butler\u2019s pantry is made out of an old homesteader\u2019s cabin. Man-made ponds and streams are stocked with trout. A glass passageway to the master suite was designed so the couple\u2019s three grandchildren could watch the fish. There is also a stone heliport, an aircraft hangar and two big garages for \u201cthe toys,\u201d including a Polaris Slingshot\u2014a three-wheeled motorcycle\u2014and numerous all-terrain vehicles.Mr. Gordy\u2019s business interests and his love for land have at times come into conflict. In 2013, his RGGS Land & Minerals issued a lease to a mining company to extract iron ore from a section of northern Wisconsin\u2019s scenic Penokee Range. The prospect of an open-pit mine amid the hills, forest and trout streams outraged local residents, environmentalists and Native American tribes. Plans were eventually shelved\u2014due to a decline in iron ore prices, according to Mr. Gordy.\u201cThe land is beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Nature Conservancy would like to buy it, but I\u2019ve probably got $2 [billion] to $3 billion in iron-ore royalties in it; what are you going to do?\u201dMr. Gordy said he has toyed with the idea of turning the Penokee land into a commercial bird-hunting retreat, stocked with woodcocks and grouse.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be fun.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oilman-russell-gordy-has-a-96-million-collectionof-ranches-1500566269", "keywords": ["amy gamerman,buffalo heights,gordy & sons outfitters,ranch homes,ranch real estate,rggs land & minerals,russell gordy,political,general news,real estate,property,construction"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 11:56:00", "news_title": "EU, U.K. Make Progress in Brexit Talks but Clash Over Divorce Bill", "content": "BRUSSELS\u2014The second round of Brexit negotiations wrapped up Thursday, with the European Union acknowledging progress but the two sides clashing over a financial settlement and the role of EU courts once Britain leaves the bloc.The EU\u2019s chief negotiator,       Michel Barnier,        urged Britain to move speedily to offer more clarity on a number of disputed points, in particular which past spending pledges to the EU London will stand by once it exits the bloc, expected in March 2019.The issue of the divorce bill has long hovered over the discussions, with EU officials saying Britain may face exit payments upward of \u20ac60 billion ($69 billion).The U.K. government has publicly recognized it will still have financial commitments to the EU once it leaves. However, at a joint news conference with Mr. Barnier, U.K. Brexit Secretary       David Davis       wouldn\u2019t comment on whether Britain would make a payment to the EU. Some British ministers have claimed the EU would owe Britain money once everything is netted out.\u201cThe first round was about organization, the second round about presentation, the third round must be about clarification,\u201d Mr. Barnier said at the press conference.He said a clarification of the U.K. position on the financial settlement would be \u201cindispensable\u201d for him to report to EU leaders in the autumn that enough progress had been made in the first phase of talks.The EU has said it wants to see \u201csufficient progress\u201d on priority issues\u2014the divorce bill, citizens\u2019 rights, Northern Ireland and other separation issues\u2014to start discussions on a future trade agreement with the U.K. Mr. Barnier has said he hopes to say that threshold has been met in October.Officials on both sides said Britain had offered no details on its position on the bill and it remains unclear whether the U.K. will start committing in coming months to some future payments. They said Britain used the week\u2019s discussions on the exit bill to ask questions about the EU\u2019s legal analysis.A British official said they gleaned relatively little clarity from the back-and-forth. However an EU official said \u201cwe were able to answer each of\u201d their questions.Mr. Davis was more upbeat in his take on this week\u2019s talks. He said the two sides had \u201crobust and constructive talks\u201d and there was much to be positive about following the four-day negotiating session. However, he acknowledged the need for flexibility on both sides to advance the talks.On citizens\u2019 rights, where Britain and the EU have both set down detailed stances, Mr. Barnier said the two sides were headed in a \u201ccommon direction\u201d but noted a \u201cfundamental divergence\u201d over a critical issue\u2014the role of the EU courts in the U.K. post-Brexit.British officials said the two sides shared common ground on most of the specific issues around citizens\u2019 rights, which focus on the residency rights and benefits EU citizens will get in Britain and U.K. citizens will receive in Europe in future.The issue of the role of the EU courts in Britain post-Brexit is a complicating one. U.K. Prime Minister       Theresa May       has set as one of her red lines that once Britain leaves the bloc, British courts will adjudicate based on British laws.However, the EU wants the ECJ to have a deciding role across a range of areas including on whether the British government is correctly upholding the Brexit agreement if a deal is made. The EU also wants the ECJ to be able to process fresh claims against the British government or British firms after Brexit if the alleged breach of EU rules happened during the years when Britain was an EU member.This week\u2019s talks come as Ms. May sought to quell cabinet leaks and divisions over Brexit and other issues. Ms. May\u2019s Conservative party lost its parliamentary majority following snap elections called for June 8.That has raised the risk that the government will be unable to get important Brexit-related legislation approved in parliament and raised pressure on Mrs. May to soften her Brexit negotiation objectives.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com and Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-barnier-seeks-clarity-from-u-k-over-brexit-divorce-bill-1500550926", "keywords": ["brexit,brexit divorce,brexitinset,brexit talks,david davis,michel barnier,European Union,U.K. government,David Davis,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,society,community,international relations,politics,domestic politics,marriage,divorce"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 11:47:00", "news_title": "Censors Scrub Korean Soaps Off China\u2019s Screens", "content": "In the Chinese government\u2019s relentless policing of the internet, political news and discussions draw heavy scrutiny while entertainment has generally been given wide leeway. As a result, many Chinese millennials grew up watching videos of South Korean soap operas, American TV shows and Japanese animation series.This generation spends a lot of time watching videos of sports and entertainment; research firm Analysys International says more than 70% of China\u2019s mobile-video users are under 30 and nearly three-quarters of them watch at least one to two hours of video everyday. Consciously or otherwise, many pay little attention to politics.Their indifference is being shaken up now. Under President       Xi Jinping\u2019s       more assertive guidance, the Communist Party is trying to instill patriotism and reinsert ideology into public life. Instead of American TV situation comedies, Beijing wants Chinese youth to watch revolutionary-themed series and other politically inspiring fare.The effect is unsettling for many young Chinese\u2014and for the online companies building businesses catering to them.\u201cIt feels like the government is yelling into your ears about its existence every day now,\u201d says Gloria Liu, a 23-year-old law graduate student in the northeastern city of Changchun.Storm clouds have been gathering for some time. Earlier this year, Chinese video websites pulled popular South Korean music videos and TV dramas after Beijing clashed with Seoul over its deployment of a U.S. missile-defense system. Last month, after meeting with regulators, social-media sites deleted many entertainment and celebrity-gossip accounts.The real blow came last week when video-streaming sites Bilibili and AcFun\u2014popular among teenagers and young Chinese\u2014removed most of their U.S., U.K., Japanese and South Korean movies, TV dramas and shows to comply with what they say are regulatory requirements.On social media, young people said they were \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cpowerless\u201d when they found out their bookmarked videos on those sites had disappeared overnight.Bilibili says all of its film and TV content is being reviewed to ensure it meets regulatory standards and that foreign films and TV shows comprise only about 10% of all content. AcFun says the company is making changes based on the regulator\u2019s guidance and its site won\u2019t carry any illegal or inappropriate content.The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.This curtailing of content is hitting businesses that, according to industry people, aren\u2019t yet profitable.Both Bilibili and AcFun started out catering to animation fans and then expanded into more mainstream content. Viewers can post real-time comments that scroll across the screen\u2014a huge draw for the young audience.Bilibili, founded in 2009 and owned by Shanghai Hode Information Technology, says it has 150 million monthly active users, three-fourths of whom are below the age of 24. AcFun, which was launched in 2007 and has             Alibaba Group Holding\u2019s       Youku Tudou video site as an investor, declined to disclose user numbers. Both companies, which rely on advertising and games for revenue, declined to comment on their profitability.The latest crackdown, if sustained, is likely to affect their revenues, according to investors. It has already poured cold water on investing in other online entertainment startups, one of the hottest plays over the past two years because of the demand from millennials.Investors feel \u201canxious and powerless\u201d about the current situation, says a venture capitalist whose fund suspended negotiations with startups creating online entertainment content.\u2018It feels like the government is yelling into your ears about its existence every day now\u2019Upset fans aren\u2019t taking to the streets; so far their protests are confined to social media. But the forced changes to their viewing diets are causing some to rethink their relationship with a government seen largely as a distant presence until now.Ms. Liu, the law student, views herself as patriotic, like many of her generation. She\u2019s also a fan of South Korean pop culture, especially the K-Pop band EXO. She taught herself Korean and uploaded subtitled shows and media coverage of the band on Bilibili. Now, she says, the website no longer allows uploading of these videos.While she can still use circumvention software to bypass government internet filters to access videos on Korean sites, it isn\u2019t the same experience as watching the shows with other fans and messaging each other in real time on Bilibili. In the past, she didn\u2019t blame the government for the nuisance of internet controls, or for her disappointment when K-Pop stars couldn\u2019t attend promotional events in China after the recent missile-defense dispute.When Ms. Liu traveled abroad as a college student, she would explain to people that China was becoming a better country. \u201cNow I feel like I was lying to myself,\u201d she says.Frank Guo, a marketing executive at an online-game company in the southern city of Guangzhou who studied in Ireland, says he doesn\u2019t understand why the government doesn\u2019t trust people to be responsible for their own viewing behavior.Like Ms. Liu, Mr. Guo thought the government was a remote force.\u201cNow it\u2019s infiltrating every detail of your life, including what entertainment you watch,\u201d he says.\u2014Follow Li Yuan on Twitter @LiYuan6 or write to li.yuan@wsj.com.Corrections & Amplifications   Bilibili was founded in 2009.

Yields rise as prices fall.The ECB\u2019s policies of ultralow interest rates and mass asset purchases have helped pin down the euro and bond yields in recent years.But with a strengthening local economy, many investors are asking whether the time is nearing when that stimulus will start to be withdrawn. That could mark an important turning point for markets given the Federal Reserve is already tightening its own monetary policy and making plans to reduce the size of its balance sheet.Mr. Draghi described the eurozone economy as \u201crobust\u201d on Thursday, but also highlighted the lack of inflation in the region, suggesting there are still reasons to keep stimulus in place. And while he said the central bank would discuss the issue of scaling back its bond-buying program in the fall, he refused to set a date. The bank\u2019s Governing Council left monetary policy unchanged on Thursday.The ECB is likely eager to avoid the sharp rise in bond yields that followed the Federal Reserve raising the prospect of trimming its bond purchases in 2013, often referred to as the taper tantrum.Mr. Draghi has \u201cdelivered a balanced and nuanced approach to the thorny issue of tapering,\u201d said Arnab Das, head of EMEA and emerging-market macro research at Invesco Fixed Income. \u201cThey are keeping their options open, but they are putting tapering on the table to try to avoid another mini tantrum.\u201dBoth bond yields and the euro have moved sharply since Mr. Draghi first hinted at tapering in June. The euro has gained around 4.5% against the dollar over the past month, while the 10-year German bond yield has more than doubled.Still, there are signs that investors aren\u2019t overly worried about the impact of the withdrawal of stimulus on riskier assets. On Thursday, Italian and Spanish bond prices rose \u2014 markets that have benefited from the ECB\u2019s bond-buying.\u201cThe European story is good right now with growth, and political risk has receded.

I am bored to tears.\u201dBeloved: A flower\u2019s comeliness depends upon its context, said Mr. Block. \u201cThat same pink impatiens in a pretty black planter can be striking and beautiful.\u201dLoathed: \u201cThe colors of azaleas are too strident, the overall form of the plant ungraceful and the ratio of flowers to foliage too equal,\u201d said       Joan Dineen       of Manhattan\u2019s Dineen Architecture and Design. \u201cOn Mother\u2019s Day, everywhere one looked were scrawny pink-flowered plants with matching hot-pink tin foil wrapping their plastic pots.

As the eurozone\u2019s economy strengthened, investors began eyeing an end to the unprecedented stimulus.At the start of 2017, less than a fifth of investors surveyed by Citi Research believed that peripheral European spreads would end the year lower. Yields move in the opposite direction to process prices. Nearly half believed they would end the year sharply or moderately higher.But since December, when the ECB said it would reduce bond purchases by \u20ac20 billion ($23 billion) a month, Spanish, Portuguese, Irish and Greek bond yields have declined in comparison with German yields.The spread between German yields and those on other bonds is commonly used as a measure of the risk that investors attach to holding other debt.\u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a car crash, a European government bond market tantrum,\u201d\u00a0said Andrea Iannelli, fixed-income investment director at Fidelity International.The sharpest fall in yields\u00a0this year\u00a0has been in Greece, where the spread against German bunds has dropped from more than 6 percentage points to around 4.5. The country, which once seemed on the verge of leaving the eurozone, received its\u00a0latest bailout tranche\u00a0from international creditors earlier this month, and is even considering returning to private markets by issuing its first bond\u00a0in three years.Investors have also returned to Irish and Spanish bonds, two countries where economic growth has outperformed and budget deficits have fallen sharply.One reason for the lack of widening in spreads is the careful messaging of the ECB, said\u00a0Gilles Pradere, a senior bond fund manager at RAM Active Investments.\u201cIt\u2019s still a very dovish message that they\u2019re sending overall,\u201d said Mr. Pradere. \u201cThey talk about patience, that they\u2019re not done yet.\u201dOn Thursday, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Greek bonds continued to rally, in a sign that investors are becoming increasingly relaxed about holding the debt of these countries, which they once sold heavily.Mr. Pradere said the ECB doesn\u2019t want to repeat the mistake he believes the U.S. Federal Reserve made in 2013. That May, the Fed\u2019s announcement\u00a0that it would begin reducing bond-buying sparked the so-called taper tantrum, when U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose from 2% to 3% by early September.Many analysts now expect the ECB to announce in September a reduction in the bond-buying program for a fixed period\u2014for example, cutting monthly purchases to\u00a0\u20ac40 billion for a particular number of months. The Fed\u00a0trimmed its buying by a set amount every month until it was no longer\u00a0accumulating bonds.Investors\u2019 concerns over the periphery have been soothed by stronger growth in the eurozone,\u00a0which has recently outstripped the U.S.\u201cThe economy is definitely in a better place than it was last year\u2014that helps sentiment and risk appetite,\u201d said Mr.\u00a0Iannelli at Fidelity International.Worries about regional political risk that capped investors\u2019 enthusiasm for Europe through much of this year have also waned. The anti-euro political candidates that had ridden high in French and Dutch opinion polls failed to win their elections, while support for Germany\u2019s antiestablishment party have fallen.Some analysts and investors still believe that debt markets in Europe\u2019s periphery are most exposed to tapering.\u201cWe remain firmly biased toward peripheral spreads widening going forward,\u201d said Rabobank strategists in a recent research note. The Dutch bank said that as investors begin to price in tapering, financing costs will rise for these countries, which will feed into concern over their ability to eventually pay back debts.Analysts say that Italian debt is most at risk from tapering. The country\u2019s government debt is equivalent to around 133% of gross domestic product, compared with 97% in France and 68% in Germany. The spread on\u00a0Italy\u2019s 10-year bond is the only one among peripheral markets to\u00a0not fall against Germany, though nor have they risen notably. The spread has been effectively unchanged\u00a0compared with eight months ago.Political risk in Italy hasn\u2019t faded. The country will go to the polls early next year, with the anti-euro populist 5 Star Movement regularly leading in national surveys.\u201cThe Italian risks are just coming later, they\u2019ve not been resolved,\u201d said       Richard Barwell,        senior economist at             BNP Paribas.Write to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Europe\u2019s Most Fragile Bonds Strengthen.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-most-fragile-bonds-power-through-ecb-taper-talk-1500565228", "keywords": ["ecb, ecb qe, europe periphery, eurozone, qe,European Central Bank,Andrea Iannelli,Mario Draghi,Gilles Pradere,Richard Barwell,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 11:32:00", "news_title": "Keeping Tour de France Bikes Safe Takes More Than a Chain", "content": "Laissac-S\u00e9v\u00e9rac-l\u2019\u00c9glise, FranceEvery mechanic at the Tour de France has the same recurring nightmare. They wake up before a stage, head to the hotel parking lot and find the team truck completely devoid of bicycles.Occasionally, the nightmare comes true. For professional teams that spend more than 200 days a year on the road, from Argentina to Japan to the Tour de France, robberies are one of the biggest\u2014and most expensive\u2014risks in the sport.\u201cThere are a few times a year that it happens,\u201d said Tristan Hoffman, a director with the Bahrain-Merida team that had a set of bikes pilfered in June. \u201cEverything you need for the race is in [the truck] and that\u2019s expensive stuff.\u201dIf you ever worry that you forgot to lock the front wheel while chaining up your commuter bike, try fretting over a whole team\u2019s complement of high-end road machines, all locked in a brightly branded truck outside a motel. (Cycling teams often stay in motels, because they require so much room for all their vehicles.)\u201cIf three, four teams are staying there, it\u2019s not hundreds of thousands, but millions of euros in one parking [lot],\u201d said Arne Houtekier, an official with the Belgian Lotto-Soudal team.In the past season alone, at least two professional teams were burgled at races in the Netherlands and two more suffered attempted break-ins.So, this July, the Tour de France is taking no chances. Its status as the highest-profile bike race on the planet, combined with the broader security threat in France these days, prompted the Tour to assign a security guard to patrol every parking lot at every team hotel, all night, for three weeks.Veteran sporting directors said they had never seen that at any Grand Tour.Each team travels to the Tour with, at minimum, a bus decked out with lounge seats and a shower to transport the riders; a fleet of team cars; moving vans; and a kitchen. Multiply that by 22 teams and you begin to appreciate the size of the Tour\u2019s traveling circus. All told, race officials said they accredited 660 vehicles for the teams alone.But none carry more precious cargo than each team\u2019s mechanics\u2019 truck, which serves as a rolling, pop-up workshop. Lotto-Soudal said it hauled 45 bikes to the Tour for its nine-man team, plus that many sets of spare tires and enough extra parts to service all of them.After more than a century of pro cycling history, the best precaution teams can take to keep it all safe is primitive: locking the truck and parking another team car across the back to block the door.\u201cYou just park them as close together as possible,\u201d Cannondale-Drapac coach Andreas Klier said.The method isn\u2019t flawless. And when it fails, the result is instant chaos.\u201cYou need to restore the stuff, you need to find new bikes. And then the mechanics have to build the new bikes. It\u2019s a lot of extra work,\u201d Hoffman said.And if it wasn\u2019t possible to ship in a load of new bikes? \u201cI would call all the other teams and use bikes from them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can you do? Otherwise you stop.\u201dTeam Sky, despite being the richest outfit in the sport, was prepared to do just that in early 2014 when thieves made off with 16 of Sky\u2019s Pinarello bikes at the Tour du Haut Var in France. Only two were left behind for the eight-man team. \u201cWe presume they only left those because they\u2019d run out of space in whatever transport they were using,\u201d one Sky coach said at the time.Not all thieves require elaborate truck heists. Plenty of professional bicycles are lifted just like the ones parked on a city street in crimes of opportunity.Lotto-Soudal mechanic Yannick Verstraete remembered one bold thief making off with one of the team\u2019s bikes right before the start of the Milan-San Remo race five or six years ago when the rider wasn\u2019t looking.Still, that wasn\u2019t as brazen as the apparent attempted theft of then-Cannondale-            Garmin                   rider Ben King\u2019s bicycle during the 2015 Vuelta a Espana. King was looking for his missing bike computer after a crash when a shirtless spectator with a cigarette in his mouth popped out of the crowd and tried to get in the saddle.\u201cDon\u2019t know if he was \u2018helping\u2019 or taking off as I was searching people for my stolen Garmin [computer],\u201d King wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhat a cluster!\u201dAs for what happens to stolen professional-caliber bikes, it turns out the market is somewhat limited. Which came as a relief to the Polish team CCC Sprandi Polkowice when all of their bikes and spare wheels disappeared ahead of the Amstel Gold Race in the Netherlands last April. CCC immediately had its base back home dispatch a new set of bikes, but before they arrived, the original race rigs reappeared.\u201cEaster miracle!\u201d the team tweeted less than 24 hours after the robbery. \u201cThe stolen bikes were found in an abandoned car! We beat the burglars!\u201dAt the Tour, directors are hoping they won\u2019t need such luck. Creative parking jobs and the odd security guard mean they can sleep easier than usual.\u201cIt will maybe not change the world,\u201d Hoffman said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a good feeling that he keeps an eye on our vehicles.\u201dWrite to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/keeping-tour-de-france-bikes-safe-takes-more-than-a-chain-1500564720", "keywords": ["bikes,cycling,tour bikes,tour de france,tour de france robberies,political,general news,crime,legal action,sports,routine general news,bicycles,bicycle parts,consumer goods,leisure,travel goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 11:27:00", "news_title": "John McCain Health News Stuns Capital; Here\u2019s Why ", "content": "At one point in his remarkable run through the New Hampshire Republican primary in 2000, Sen. John       McCain       went into full maverick mode to describe his quest to upset his party\u2019s prohibitive favorite in the race.\u201c      George Bush       is out there raising money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out there raising hell.\u201dRaising hell is what       John McCain       has always been willing to do, without much regard for party or precedent. Indeed, it often appears he can\u2019t help himself. It\u2019s a style that occasionally infuriates Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014but that ultimately has endeared him to many people in both parties, who admire his life story and the courage that has been laced through its many chapters.That admiration explains why the capital went into a kind of shock Wednesday night when the news broke that Mr. McCain has been diagnosed with a brain tumor.At one Washington dinner, perhaps a dozen cellphones pinged more or less simultaneously with the news, which temporarily brought the proceedings to a halt. Sen.       Lindsey Graham,        his closest friend in the Senate, articulated the view of many when he said that cancer has now picked the toughest opponent possible. And as if to underscore the point, Mr. McCain tweeted Thursday his intention to return to the Senate quickly.In a capital full of diverse characters, John McCain stands out. He is singular. Part of it is his remarkable story as a Vietnam War veteran: A young and somewhat reckless Navy pilot shot down over North Vietnam, grievously injured and then imprisoned under the most horrific conditions for more than five years, during which he declined opportunities to be released before his comrades. Candidate       Donald Trump       said during the 2016 campaign that Mr. McCain wasn\u2019t a war hero, but few agreed.There has followed a political career that took him first to the House and then to the Senate and ultimately to the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.But it was that iconic 2000 presidential campaign that cemented the Arizonan\u2019s reputation as a unique political figure.To anyone who wasn\u2019t there, it\u2019s almost impossible to describe what it was like. He banked his whole campaign on winning the New Hampshire primary, and set out to do so by canvassing the state, day after day, on a bus filled with aides and reporters and straight talk. In fact, it became known as the \u201cStraight Talk Express,\u201d and his dozens of town-hall meetings were a cross between religious revivals and voter-therapy sessions.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.He slaughtered his party\u2019s sacred cows and picked up support from disgruntled voters along the way. He said the GOP\u2019s big-money donors not only owned Mr. Bush, but were destroying democracy in the process. He said an emerging federal budget surplus should be used not for tax cuts, but to pay down debt and bank money for Social Security. He attacked the religious right, directly and repeatedly. He was light on policy details, but details didn\u2019t seem to be the point.He became a kind of Pied Piper in New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t just reporters who followed him around. Voters did, too; some of them trailing him in their cars from one town hall to another just to be part of it.In the end, he did win New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t enough, because he went on to lose to Mr. Bush in South Carolina and ultimately in the race for the nomination. He finally won the elusive nomination eight years later, but it felt as if he\u2019d never quite recaptured that 2000 lightning.He returned to the Senate after the 2008 loss to Barack Obama, and seemed deflated at first. But then he roared back, and now leads the powerful Armed Services Committee and occupies a prominent place in every debate and controversy. Among other things, as a victim of torture himself, he has emerged as a powerful voice against harsh interrogation techniques.Sen. McCain has occasionally struck colleagues as tired and disoriented in recent days, probably early signs of the cancer diagnosis to come. But when he appeared last month at a Wall Street Journal conference for an onstage interview, he was sharp as ever.And as outspoken as ever. He talked of his disappointment that President Donald Trump didn\u2019t raise human rights concerns on his recent trip to the Middle East: \u201cIf we abandon our advocacy for human rights, we\u2019re no different than any other nation that rises and falls throughout history,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t change human beings,\u201d Sen. McCain added. \u201cThey want freedom. They want human rights, and they look to us as the role model and our inspiration.\u201dWrite to Gerald F.

Mr. Draghi also quashed speculation that the central bank was looking more to economic growth and unemployment as a guide to future policy, stating inflation remained its sole target. Here are five takeaways.1. Bond-Buying Verdict in FallInvestors had reckoned there was a very slim chance Mr. Draghi would reveal that policy makers had for the first time discussed the future of their bond purchases after December, but it wasn\u2019t to be. Instead, he pointed to some date in the fall\u2014which could refer to meetings in either September or October\u2014as the time for decisions, stressing the need for more information and the value of fresh forecasts from the ECB\u2019s economists.2. Focused on InflationYou can read too much into what central bankers say, and some had begun to detect a shift in emphasis toward growth and unemployment rather than inflation in comments from Mr. Draghi and his colleagues over recent months. The central banker corrected that impression. \u201cOur mandate is neither growth nor employment, it\u2019s price stability,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what our monetary policy is geared for.\u201d With inflation still well below target despite stronger-than-expected growth, that suggests stimulus will be needed for some time to come.3. No LimitsOne popular theory has it that even if the ECB wanted to carry on with quantitative easing through 2018, it wouldn\u2019t be able to, because government bonds\u2014and particularly those issued by Germany\u2014are becoming too scarce. Mr. Draghi said that while his staff had not yet been tasked to examine the issue, he was confident a way could be found to continue, if it were needed. \u201cWhen the governing council needed flexibility to carry through its monetary policy, it was successful in finding it,\u201d he said.4. Sticking With the TargetSome economists have suggested that one way to create higher inflation would be to have a higher inflation target. Mr. Draghi isn\u2019t keen, arguing that would lead to damaging uncertainty and weaken the central bank\u2019s credibility. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be patient, rather than changing the objective,\u201d he said. \u201cEven to discuss changing objectives at this point in time would be highly destabilizing for expectations.\u201d5. Unwanted TighteningThe response of financial markets to his speech in Sintra clearly went too far for Mr. Draghi\u2019s comfort, with the euro strengthening and bond yields rising. What policy makers fear is that in anticipating a winding-down of bond purchases, actual financial conditions become tighter sooner than they intend. So there was a warning shot. \u201cThe last thing we may want is an unwanted tightening of conditions,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/5-takeaways-from-ecbs-news-conference-1500563851", "keywords": ["ecb bond purchases,ecb policy,ecb tapering,eu inflation,europe economy,europe markets,Mario Draghi,conferences,exhibitions,corporate,industrial news,economic news,banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 11:09:00", "news_title": "How to Organize Your Closet\u2014When You Really Love Fashion", "content": "Mandana Dayani, the Los Angeles-based chief brand officer of online estate-sale website Everything But the House (EBTH), recently reorganized her walk-in with a professional: \u201cIt was the most therapeutic thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she said.On hanging order: Ms. Dayani goes for the classic combination of hanging clothes by color and category. \u201cBlazers together and organized by color; coats by color and so on,\u201d said Ms. Dayani. The one exception is her dresses. \u201cWe organized them by length,\u201d she said. Anything embellished for evening is in a garment bag\u2014with a clear window\u2014to avoid snagging its neighbor.On shoe storage: Ms. Dayani is lucky enough to have a wall of shoe shelves in her walk-in. But a recent tweak in how she arranges them has made a big difference. \u201cI used to do one heel forward, one toe forward to save space,\u201d she said. This time I did both toes forward; it just feels happier.\u201d All boots get stuffers to keep them upright. \u201cYou see them so much better,\u201d she said.On the best practice everyone can follow: Don\u2019t jam a closet to the brim.

Being able to see and access your clothes, said Ms. Ross, is a crucial step in being stylish. \u201c[Getting dressed] is like baking a cake,\u201d she added. \u201cYou have to have the right ingredients on hand\u2014and know when to mix them.\u201dOn shoe storage: Again, visibility is important. \u201cNothing is in a box,\u201d said Ms. Ross of the floor-to-ceiling shoe shelves in her main closet.On the best practice everyone can follow: Take stock every season. Twice a year, she purges pieces she\u2019s not wearing and knows she won\u2019t wear again. She also sifts through various secondary closets to find things she\u2019ll want to access quickly and moves them to her main closet. \u201cIt\u2019s like shopping in your own wardrobe,\u201d she said. \u201cI pull out things from 10 years ago that are relevant today.\u201dThough she\u2019s streamlined her wardrobe since having kids (ages 7, 6 and 1), Brett Heyman, founder of handbag line Edie Parker, still requires serious closet space for a vintage collection which, she said charmingly, equips her to dress for impromptu costume parties.On hanging order: Ms. Heyman also hangs by type\u2014trousers, skirts, dresses, et cetera\u2014which is probably so common because it\u2019s simply logical. The designer is dedicated to one sort of hanger\u2014the razor-thin SlimLine brand. \u201cIt\u2019s out of necessity,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t fit anything else.\u201dOn shoe storage: Ms. Heyman made her closets a priority when she renovated an apartment with her husband eight years ago. Footwear got its own special place. \u201cI used faux Venetian glass to make a beautiful wall in our bedroom that you open [to reveal] a shallow shoe closet.\u201d One drawback: it doesn\u2019t fit boots. \u201cI just put them in my main closet and close my eyes,\u201d she said.On the best practice everyone can follow: Don\u2019t get too attached to stuff. \u201cThere are so many great consignment places,\u201d said Ms. Heyman.

We use a radar subscription service called dtn WeatherSentry that tells me the dew point, humidity, wind speed and \u201cevapotranspiration\u201d rate\u2014which is how much water the grass could be losing in a day. I\u2019m looking at it from the time I wake up to when I go to bed and all throughout the day because it can change drastically from one moment to the next.We cut grass at the ballpark two times a day using the Toro Reelmaster 3100-D. With eight separate blades on each reel, it has an almost scissor-type of cut, unlike the rotary mower you would use at home, which spins clockwise. If you have a really jagged cut or your blades are dull, it can cause infection in the grass by creating a point of entry for fungus to get into the plant and destroy it. The Reelmaster provides a healthy, straight-edge cut.A Leatherman Wingman is on me all the time. It has a bunch of tools\u2014I use the pliers or the blade if I need to cut out dead material [from the grass] or fix an irrigation head.Another important tool that we use is the AcuRite 00661 Soil Thermometer, which helps us keep an eye on how hot our soil is. Any time the temperature is over 65 degrees, you have prime conditions for disease for the field\u2019s Kentucky bluegrass. You can cool the soil down with water, but you have to watch it, because too much water can cause disease as well. It\u2019s really a fine line between too much and too little, too hot and too cold. It\u2019s something that you have to monitor a couple of times a day.I\u2019m here from 9:30 in the morning until an hour and a half after every game. I\u2019m outside for 10 hours a day straight, so sunglasses and sunscreen are very important. Right now I\u2019m wearing Maui Jim Blue Hawaii Mavericks sunglasses. For sunscreen, I like Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 70. It doesn\u2019t feel too greasy. I just have to be mindful to reapply all the time. You can\u2019t just put it on once.My main job during the game is to monitor the radar and make sure that we\u2019re ready for any storms that could possibly impact the playability of the surface or our fans.

The hamlet and neighboring village of Kingham have become ultra fashionable thanks to a single local business.The woman behind Daylesford\u2019s rise is Lady       Carole Bamford,        the wife of industrialist Lord Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB.The couple own a 1,500-acre country estate in the area and in the late 1990s Lady Bamford developed an interest in organic food and traditional farming methods. In 2002 she opened a stylish farm store and cafe she named Daylesford Organic.The venture drew Londoners like bees to honey. \u201cThey want somewhere to go where they can get their skinny latte,\u201d explained Luke Morgan, a partner at Strutt & Parker\u2019s country department.Today the Daylesford brand has four shops, a spa, a Michelin-starred country pub and culinary school.Mr. Morgan says the enterprise has had a transformative effect on Daylesford and Kingham, where properties now carry a price premium of 10%. \u201cVillages like Kingham have been upgraded to super-village status in the last few years,\u201d said Mr. Morgan. \u201cWhen we do have something for sale there, it flies off the shelf.\u201dDaylesford and Kingham have advantages beyond proximity to Lady Bamford\u2019s store. Both villages are located about 90 miles outside of London\u2014a manageable weekend commute and popular with celebrities. The former Blur bassist Alex James owns a farm just outside Kingham and hosts an annual music and food festival, the Big Feastival.The beautiful countryside is dotted with period properties. Knight Frank is currently listing a stone manor house in nearby Maugersbury for \u00a31.95 million, or $2.55 million. The 9,505-square-foot house comes with almost 2 acres of land.The \u201cDaylesford Effect\u201d is spreading. \u201cMore recently we have seen a reinvigoration of the local pub in the surrounding areas, where in many, food has taken center stage,\u201d Lady Bamford said in a written response.This spread has reached as far as the county of Wiltshire, where the Swedish owner of the             H&M                   fashion brand,       Stefan Persson,        owns a country estate near Ramsbury, 70 miles from London. He also owns the local pub\u2014the Bell. \u201cHe has totally revamped that pub,\u201d said buying agent Charlie Wells, managing director of Prime Purchase.In the village of Kersey, located in Suffolk, a rural county 80 miles east of London, buyers pay an estimated 10% premium on properties like Bridge House, a pink-painted five-bedroom historic home right in the center of the village, which is listed with             Savills                   with a guide price of $1.17 million.Caroline Edwards,        a partner at Carter Jonas estate agents, said that four years ago, the village\u2019s \u201cpretty average\u201d pub, the Bell Inn, was bought by sisters Wendy Green and Janet Woolard.The venue was previously slightly frosty to wealthy incoming urban types, Ms. Edwards said, but is now a \u201ccompletely inclusive\u201d spot, welcoming London hedge-fund managers and local farm laborers alike. \u201cIt has become a real heart of the local community,\u201d she said.She is convinced the warm welcome at the Bell has boosted prices in Kersey at a time when the rural market in Britain is flailing.In 2014, the British government increased stamp-duty costs on homes worth roughly $2 million or more. In 2016 it imposed a 3% stamp-duty surcharge on second homes. What this means is that anyone spending about $2 million on a second home in the country will pay about $122,850 in taxes, an increase that has shaken the prime rural market.And businesses like Daylesford and the Bell are also bucking a trend which is seeing traditional pubs and village stores\u2014selling basic groceries\u2014close amid online competition and changing lifestyles. According to the advocacy group Campaign for Real Ale, 21 British pubs close for good every week.In the face of these closures an increasing number of local communities are coming together to save local businesses.Mr. Wells cites the example of the Queens Arms in East Garston, Berkshire. \u201cThe pub was facing closure three or four years ago until it was bought by a couple of local residents who wanted to keep a pub in the village,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was in effect a community buyout has resulted in a great success story.\u201dA similar community effort helped open a not-for-profit shop in the village of Lodsworth in West Sussex. The Lodsworth Larder opened in 2009, with a strong emphasis on organic, sustainable, seasonal produce (plus a gluten-free range). Most of its produce is supplied by small local businesses, and it is squarely aimed at affluent locals, many of whom commute the 50 miles to central London.Philip Harvey,        managing partner at Property Vision, said the shop has elevated Lodsworth above surrounding villages. Properties, as a result, are 10% more expensive, he estimated.For Lindsay Cuthill, head of Savills\u2019 country department, the premium pricing makes sense. \u201cIf you had a choice between living in a village which had a nice pub or shop and one which did not, you would choose the one with,\u201d he said. \u201cErgo prices go up.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Lord Bamford as Sir Anthony Bamford, and the company as Daylesford Organics.

The SARB now expects gross domestic product to grow just 0.5% this year, down from a previous prediction of 1% growth.Next year, GDP is expected to expand 1.2%, down from 1.5% forecast previously and 1.5% in 2019, down from 1.7% previously predicted.\u201cA number of sentiment indicators and data points have reached levels last seen during the 2009 recession, at the height of the global financial crisis,\u201d the bank\u2019s governor, Lesetja Kganyago, warned.Mr. Kganyago said the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee didn\u2019t believe the rate cut would boost growth in any significant way, but could provide some relief at the margins.\u201cTinkering with monetary policy is not going to produce the engineers that this economy needs. It\u2019s not going to build more ports,\u201d he said.Most analysts had expected the bank to keep rates on hold, and Mr. Kganyago acknowledged that the committee was split in its decision, with four members voting for a reduction, while two would have preferred to keep the repo rate at 7%.Even as the economy has struggled, a relatively strong rand and low oil prices allowed the bank to take a more dovish position. For three months running, consumer inflation has been within the bank\u2019s 3%-to-6% target range and the SARB now expects consumer prices to rise at a slower rate in the coming years.The bank sees consumer prices increasing 5.3% this year, down from an earlier forecast of 5.7% inflation. In 2018 inflation is expected to fall to 4.9%, before rising again to 5.2% in 2019.Pressure on the SARB to cut rates has been mounting in recent months, amid a debate on whether its mandate needed to be shifted away from inflation targeting toward wealth redistribution. South Africa is one of the most unequal societies in the world, where much of the wealth is still owned by the white majority.Mr. Kganyago said the bank took its decision based on economic factors not political pressures, but warned that the debate created uncertainty for the businesses and policy makers. \u201cUncertainty is not what South Africa is looking for at this stage,\u201d he said.Write to Gabriele Steinhauser at gabriele.steinhauser@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-africa-cuts-repo-rate-amid-weaker-growth-outlook-1500558550", "keywords": ["consumer prices,economic outlook,gdp forecast,inflation,interest rates,south african central bank,south african economy,The South African Reserve Bank,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,prices,monetary policy,economic news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 10:41:00", "news_title": "3 Books for Travelers Who Prefer Exploring by Foot ", "content": "By Sarah Baxter ($28, Thunder Bay Press)British travel writer Sarah Baxter tackles an ambitious task in this 400-page volume: compiling a list of walkable routes that have shaped natural and human history.

Mr. Wray, whom Mr. Trump nominated last month after firing       James Comey,        has drawn bipartisan praise on Capitol Hill and has faced no serious obstacles from his confirmation in the Senate.He inherits leadership of the FBI from Mr. Comey, who was fired by the president in the middle of an investigation into Russian activity during the 2016 presidential election and whether Mr. Trump or his associates had contact with Moscow. Mr. Comey\u2019s firing alarmed many senators in both parties.An attorney by training, Mr. Wray has worked in private practice and the U.S. government.

Before that, he was a federal prosecutor in Georgia and served in the Justice Department leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In 2003, he was tapped to run the criminal division of the Justice Department.Mr. Wray\u2019s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week earned him bipartisan praise.During his appearance, he vowed independence from the president and a thorough investigation of questions about Russian interference or collusion in the democratic process. The Kremlin has denied meddling in the election and Mr. Trump has called inquiries into alleged collusion a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dSenate Republican leaders have vowed a speedy confirmation for Mr. Wray.

Inventive dishes that seem timeless.A COUPLE YEARS ago, when       Steven Satterfield       was writing his cookbook \u201cRoot to Leaf,\u201d the publisher nixed a chapter devoted to peanuts at the last minute. \u201cIt was deemed too colloquial,\u201d said Mr. Satterfield. \u201cThe book was meant to have national appeal.\u201d But the Savannah-born, Atlanta-based chef couldn\u2019t let it go; he knows how versatile and appealing this Southern staple can be. So he presented the jettisoned recipes to another publisher, Short Stack Editions, and four months ago his \u201cPeanuts\u201d cookbook hit the shelves.That\u2019s where this recipe, his final Slow Food Fast contribution, comes from. It stars grilled okra, nestled into a lemon-yogurt spread spiced with cumin and coriander. Generous handfuls of toasted peanuts and torn mint are scattered overtop.\u201cGrilled okra gets a nice green-bean texture and a bit of smokiness from the grill,\u201d said Mr. Satterfield. If you\u2019re wary of the viscous quality okra can have, take heart: This quick-cooking technique produces crisp-tender results without that familiar ooze. But it\u2019s the crunch of the toasted peanuts that really gives this quick summertime recipe snap.Total Time: 20 minutes Serves: 41. Submerge several 6-inch wooden skewers in water to soak. Preheat a grill.2. Place yogurt in a medium bowl. Use a fine grater to grate garlic and lemon zest over yogurt. Halve lemon and squeeze one half into yogurt. Add cumin, coriander, red pepper flakes and season with salt and more lemon juice, if needed. Stir to combine and refrigerate until ready to use.3. Thread a skewer through 4-6 okra pods just below caps. Thread a second skewer through the same pods, about \u00bd inch from the tapered tips, creating a secure plank of skewered pods. Repeat with remaining skewers and okra, leaving about 1 inch of bare skewer at each end.4. Brush both sides of okra with oil and sprinkle with salt. Place okra skewers on hot grill and cook until okra begins to char, about 2 minutes. Flip and grill opposite side until charred, about 2 minutes more. Transfer grilled okra to a platter and discard skewers.5. To serve, spread yogurt sauce over a serving platter or individual plates. Drizzle with oil and top with okra.

Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Kim Eckart.Elder fraud is a well-known problem in the U.S.: Studies have shown that seniors lose nearly $3 billion annually, whether to outside scammers or manipulative family members. But we hear less about the financial cognitive decline\u2014the stage at which a person starts to lose an understanding of how to manage their money\u2014that can set the stage for elder fraud.When senior citizens experience financial cognitive decline they might start bouncing checks or forgetting to pay credit cards; they might begin to lose track of what money is coming in from investments, pension funds or Social Security; or they may forget how to pay their taxes. For example, a client of ours set herself up for automatic debit of her credit-card bill, but continued to receive a paper statement that she then paid\u2014she was double-paying on her credit card and didn\u2019t know it.Seniors experiencing this cognitive decline also can be financially vulnerable to family, friends or strangers who might take advantage of them. As advisers, we should try to prevent this situation.First, have a form on file that gives you permission to talk to other family members or trusted associates if a concern arises. Second, identify the future financial caretaker who will step in when the client is no longer able to manage their affairs. Make sure everyone in the family knows who that is and how information will be communicated. My firm creates family-engagement standards that spell out the client\u2019s wants and needs and then share it with the family.Once a client is older and in greater need of assistance, encourage him or her to simplify their financial affairs by consolidating accounts and then using aggregation software, such as Mint.com or eMoney Advisor, to keep track of them. This software lets the client, the adviser and the financial caretaker view all of the client\u2019s different account information in one place without withdrawal access to the accounts. That way, the adviser, the client and the client\u2019s family members can monitor the account, helping to ensure there is nothing amiss.\u201cUsing this software can be a tough sell: Elderly people often don\u2019t always like their financial affairs to be visible to their family. But I explain to clients that their information is already on the internet, and that by creating a login and getting help monitoring their affairs, they can help keep fraudsters from accessing their information instead.\u201dYou want elderly people to have as much control for as long as possible, as long as it\u2019s safe. But if you see something amiss, use nonthreatening, nonjudgmental conversational tools and open-ended questions to bring it up.

The location reopened on Wednesday.As of late Wednesday night,       Patrick Quade,        the founder of the food poisoning website, said the site had received reports of 133 people sickened at the Sterling Chipotle.\u201cWe know that maintaining the highest level of safety in all of our restaurants is incumbent upon us.

He said his staff carefully vets the reports that come in to ensure they come from distinct internet addresses and legitimate email addresses.Aside from the Sterling outbreak, \u201cWe have no confirmed reports of illnesses from Virginia or Maryland,\u201d a Chipotle spokesman said.Dr. Goodfriend said his office works closely with the state health department, which also works with neighboring states, and that he isn\u2019t aware of any cases that are similar to what he\u2019s seeing in Sterling. \u201cWhen you get a high profile situation like this, you\u2019re more likely to have folks report about restaurants in other locations,\u201d he said.The spokesman deferred to the health department for the latest figures but said as for the reports coming in on the website, \u201cthere is no medical or clinical validation process\u201d for that.Chipotle\u2019s sales have been slow to recover from a series of food safety outbreaks in 2015, including norovirus and E.coli.Write to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/over-100-report-being-sickened-at-virginia-chipotle-1500559449", "keywords": ["chipotle food,chipotle outbreak,food poisoning,norovirus,sterling virginia,Chipotle Mexican Grill,CMG,product,consumer safety,corporate,industrial news,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,limited-service eating places,leisure,arts,hospitality"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 09:57:00", "news_title": "We Need to Relax Like Roger Federer", "content": "Folks, I have some news: I\u2019ve decided to mail it in for the rest of the summer.I know what you\u2019re thinking: Buddy, you\u2019re a newspaper columnist.

Greatness rest. Championship rest.Federer rest.This past Sunday,       Roger Federer       won his eighth Wimbledon men\u2019s singles title\u2014his first in five years. Weeks away from turning a sports-ancient 36, the Swiss legend is playing some of the best tennis of his life, and a big reason appears to be rest. As the Journal\u2019s Matthew Futterman has elaborated upon, an injured and exhausted Federer took six months off at the end of 2016, only to show up this January in Melbourne fresh as a daisy, and win the Australian Open. Then Federer turned right around after Oz and skipped the entire clay court season and the French Open\u2014but returned for Wimbledon and rolled to another Slam title.\u201cI\u2019ve got to take more time off,\u201d Federer said when it was done. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone again for the next six months if it keeps working out this [fantastically] when I come back.\u201dThe sports science appears increasingly clear: rest may be nature\u2019s finest performance-enhancing drug, restorative both physically and mentally. Smart teams are routinely resting key players in the NBA. (The influential San Antonio Spurs basically double as a Canyon Ranch during the regular season.) You can\u2019t tell me a four-game suspension to begin 2016 wasn\u2019t a reason a 39-year-old       Tom Brady       looked so sharp in February\u2019s Super Bowl. Cycling giant Kristin Armstrong has full on stopped and retired twice, only to turn around and win Olympic gold medals, her most recent last year at 42.Sports are catching up to what workplace productivity experts have known for ages: time off is good for everybody. Rested employees are consistently better employees, with higher performances and morale. Non-rested employees are...a grumpy disaster waiting to happen.\u201cAmericans seem to believe that logging more hours leads to increased output, but respite deprivation can actually increase mistakes and workplace animosity,\u201d then-University of Michigan nursing school Dean Kathleen Potempa wrote in the Journal a couple of years back.Yes, everyone in the office kind of hates the guy who can\u2019t stop talking about his three-month sea kayaking sabbatical. But it\u2019s far worse to be the sourpuss who won\u2019t take any vacation time and diddles away the week complaining about the air conditioning and his sandwich.It\u2019s obvious to the point of cliche: It\u2019s not the quantity of work that matters, it\u2019s the quality. This is what Federer has seized upon during what should be the end of his career. He realized: I want to win more Wimbledons. I don\u2019t really need to schlep to another Madrid Open.Federer, of course, is a globally enviable figure whom most of us will never compete with athletically, financially or stylistically. He possesses a superhuman level of grace and elegance. He basically plays tennis in a dinner jacket. It\u2019s like someone merged Rod Laver with James Bond.I\u2019ll never resemble Federer on the court.

Here, the changeable weather has a way of wiping out any opening day histrionics. Just two winners of the Claret Jug the past 40 years have led wire-to-wire. In other words, it might prove best to pay no attention to the numbers on that leaderboard, no matter how tempting it became Thursday afternoon at Royal Birkdale, as Jordan Spieth, Brooks Koepka and Matt Kuchar put up five-under 65s to set the pace as a rainy, windy morning gave way to a sun-splashed afternoon beside the Irish Sea.Better, instead, simply to take in the quirks of a congenitally quirky tournament that figures to stay that way with a whole lot of weather expected to roll in Friday afternoon.Spieth took a piece of mint gum from his coach Cameron McCormick on the way to the course Thursday morning. When he was 1-under through the challenging first three holes, he figured he ought to keep chewing, even though he seldom does when playing. He was still chomping on the gum four hours later.Spieth had a bit of wild ride around Birkdale, hitting only five of 14 fairways but getting to all but three greens in regulation, and on one of those misses he was right on the fringe. He stayed relaxed and positive throughout, far more so than early in his recent majors. Coming to an errant tee shot on the wrong side of the ropes on 16, he asked the crowd, \u201cDid I hit anyone or are we good?\u201dOn the 17th tee, he sent his ball sailing left into the tall grass. \u201cAt least we got a chance, right?\u201d he asked caddie Michael Greller. Perhaps it was the gum.Spieth dropped in birdies on the eighth and ninth holes to make the turn at three under. A strange moment arrived on the 13th hole, when someone accidentally moved his ball. No matter. He drained a 20-foot putt on the 14th for a birdie, scrambled from the rough and then a bunker to save par on 16, and left his eagle putt inches from the hole on 17 to get in position to go five-under. A makeable eight-footer for birdie on 18 curled left in the final moment, keeping him inches from a 64.Spieth said he has been eating better, aside from the occasional burger and beer, and he has been a little more focused on his fitness work at the gym. Swimmer Michael Phelps has become a friend of late and given him advice on competing.Will it matter? Friday afternoon\u2019s projected storm may have more to say about Spieth\u2019s destiny than Phelps\u2019s words of wisdom. Spieth tees off at 2:48 p.m.Koepka, playing in his first competition since winning last month\u2019s U.S. Open, holed out from a greenside bunker on 17 for an eagle to draw even with Spieth. Koepka won the U.S. Open on June 18. He didn\u2019t play another practice round of golf until after July 4, and that was it before he got here last weekend to get familiar with Royal Birkdale.\u201cIt\u2019s more mental with me, being mentally re-charged,\u201d he said. Seems like he is.With the wind dying and the sun shining Thursday afternoon, Kuchar seared the front nine, going out in 29 to get to five-under. He stayed there the rest of the day, missing not-too-hard birdie putts on 14, 15 and 17, where he rimmed out from 5 feet.\u201cA great way to start,\u201d Kuchar said, before reminding everyone, \u201cit\u2019s Thursday.\u201dKuchar is 39-years-old and has never won a major. But five of the last six Open champions have been his age or older. He should be done by early afternoon on Friday, before the predicted sideways rain comes around. Perhaps there lies the fabled luck of the British Open draw.Lurking right behind them were Paul Casey of England, Charl Schwartzel of South Africa and Rafael Cabrera-Bello of Spain.At first, a fortunate draw made no difference to Rory McIlroy, who is in the same \u201clater-early\u201d shift as Kuchar. McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, was 5-over on the front-nine, before making four birdies on the back to get to 1-over. The player who so recently looked like the sport\u2019s next big thing remains an enigma.Despite McIlroy\u2019s travails, there was a moment Thursday morning when the championship had a proper British leaderboard: Ian Poulter, Justin Rose, and Matthew Fitzpatrick of England were all up there, as was Stuart Manley of Wales. By the end of the day, after the calm afternoon, only Poulter from that list remained in the top 10. England\u2019s Casey and Richard Bland were also in the top 10.Manley, who flirted with a pro soccer career as a teenager, braved the wind and the rain of his ugly 6:46 a.m. start time to become the clubhouse leader before noon.By the time he walked off the 18th green, he\u2019d been up for nine hours. His six-month old baby woke him at 3 a.m. needing his \u201cdummy\u201d (British for pacifier). Manley never went back to sleep, though his alarm was set for 4 a.m. He arrived at Royal Birkdale around 5:15, grabbed some breakfast and hit balls for an hour, then teed off. Manley grinded through the morning cold and the 20 mile per hour wind as he stood in a greenside bunker on the par-five 17th he was just one shot over par. His wedge found the hole for an eagle, then he drained a 40-foot putt on 18 to card a 2-under 68.A bit of late controversy arose late in the day on 17, when Jon Rahm fiddled with a long plant \u201cwith thorns in it\u201d around his ball and by moving the plant may have improved his lie.

In 2015, Ford Motor Co. and Google also were in talks about a partnership on self-driving technology, a person familiar with the situation said at that time. The talks broke off, and no deal was ever reached. In February, Ford invested $1 billion in self-driving startup Argo AI.Honda and Waymo said last December they would talk about teaming up, a sign that Honda was looking for help in catching up with larger, better-funded rivals in the race to develop next-generation car technology.Mr. Hachigo said the discussions are still alive, and he said people from Honda and Waymo meet regularly in Mountain View, Calif., where both have offices. The lack of specific progress \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve come to a deadlock or we\u2019re not getting anywhere,\u201d he said.Asked whether Waymo\u2019s willingness to share technology was an issue, Mr. Hachigo said the talks hadn\u2019t progressed far enough for that to come up.A person familiar with Waymo\u2019s thinking said talks have moved little in the past seven months. The two companies are looking at equipping Honda vehicles with Waymo hardware or having Honda manufacture vehicles for Waymo\u2019s road tests of self-driving cars, this person said.Analysts said the lack of progress was worrisome because they said Honda, which is about half the size of Toyota and         General Motors Co.       in terms of annual car sales, needed to collaborate more on technology.\u201cThe whole reason they inked an agreement is a recognition that they can\u2019t do it alone. They both need each other,\u201d said Christopher Richter, an auto analyst at CLSA. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit discouraging that things can\u2019t move more quickly.\u201dKurt Sanger, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said, \u201cHonda doesn\u2019t have a history of playing well in the sandbox.\u201dHonda\u2019s Mr. Hachigo rejected that view, saying his company was working well with European suppliers of self-driving technology. He also highlighted a partnership with         Hitachi Ltd.       to build electric motors for vehicles.\u201cWe want to attach importance to collaboration with suppliers that can work together with us in the field of motors, batteries and electronic control,\u201d he said.The one big auto maker that has advanced in its work with Waymo is         Fiat Chrysler Automobiles               NV. Fiat Chrysler manufactures minivans equipped with Waymo\u2019s suite of sensors and sells them to Waymo for testing use. It took around six months from the deal\u2019s signing to delivery of the first vehicles, Waymo Chief Executive       John Krafcik       said in a December blog post.In the time since the Honda talks were announced, Waymo has looked outside the class of traditional car makers for collaborations. It signed a deal with ride-hailing startup Lyft Inc. to co-develop self-driving technology and in June tapped rental car company         Avis Budget Group Inc.       to maintain its growing fleet of driverless cars.Honda plans to sell a car capable of driving itself on highways by 2020 and on city streets by 2025, but its own self-driving suite is still in the early stages of development.Yuji Yasui, a Honda engineer in charge of automated driving, said the company would need to staff up and obtain outside software expertise to meet the targets. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to achieve them with what we have now,\u201d Mr. Yasui said. \u201cWe need to expand our collaborative relationship with universities and maybe other startups\u2014especially on software.\u201d\u2014Jack Nicas contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   In 2015, Ford Motor Co. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google were in talks about a partnership on self-driving technology, a person familiar with the situation said at that time.

Backers of the Seattle measure expected to be signed this week by Mayor Ed Murray, a Democrat, are spoiling for a legal fight they believe will pave the way for a statewide income tax.Taxpayer advocacy groups, meanwhile, are gearing up for litigation, confident that the state courts will reject this tax as they have in the past.The new Seattle measure would impose a 2.25% tax on any income over $250,000 or above $500,000 for couples filing jointly. The city would use the estimated $140 million in new annual revenue to fund affordable housing, education and transit services, and replace federal funding that might be lost because of federal budget cuts.The city, which is the midst of a tech boom, already has a balanced budget.Backers are hoping to upend the state\u2019s tax system starting with the Seattle measure.\u201cSeattle is challenging this state\u2019s antiquated and unsustainable tax structure by passing a progressive income tax,\u201d said Mayor Murray. \u201cOur goal is to replace our regressive tax system with a new formula for fairness.\u201dSome business leaders say that the income tax would make Seattle less inviting to businesses and job seekers, and cause wealthy residents to move outside the city limits.\u201cAs\u00a0a venture capitalist helping build companies, we are recruiting talent from other parts of the country and the world,\u201d said       Matt McIlwain,        managing director at Madrona Venture Group, who\u00a0has\u00a0formed\u00a0a group to fund\u00a0the legal fight against the tax. \u201cThe whole area of attracting talent would be much harder.\u201dIn a recent radio interview, former             Microsoft                   CEO       Steve Ballmer       said that the income tax would hurt business in Seattle.\u201cIt would drive up wages here, and cause people to have to think about moving jobs elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cThat would certainly happen.\u201dNeither Microsoft, based in nearby Redmond, Wash., nor             Amazon.com Inc.,       based in Seattle, have taken public positions on the tax.A Microsoft representative declined to comment. A representative for Amazon didn\u2019t return requests for comment.Combined with new legislation in Seattle to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, \u201ceverything makes it a little more difficult to do business,\u201d said J. Thomas Ranken, chief executive of the CleanTech Alliance, which represents clean technology companies in the area.Seattle has seen housing costs and homelessness soar in recent years.Molly Moon Neitzel, owner of local chain Molly Moon\u2019s Homemade Ice Cream, said she welcomes the new tax even though it will likely eventually hit her family.\u201cThe inequality in wealth distribution in Seattle has just gotten really extreme since we started recovering from the recession,\u201d said Ms. Moon\u00a0Neitzel.A local tax-the-rich measure in a state with no income tax is unusual and so there has been little research on the type of economic impact it could have, said Justin Marlowe, a public finance professor at University of Washington\u2019s Evans School of Public Policy & Governance.Based on the small number of taxpayers, Mr. Marlowe predicted it wouldn\u2019t have a big immediate impact. But he said that businesses will be concerned that this could be the \u201cproverbial camel\u2019s nose in the tent\u201d that leads to imposing income taxes on a broader swath of earners.The expected legal fight over the measure could lead to a fundamental change to the unique politics of Washington state, a liberal-leaning state with a longstanding aversion to taxing income. A similar measure lost in the capital city of Olympia last year, and a tax-the-rich statewide initiative was voted down in 2010.The last time voters passed a graduated statewide income tax, it was struck down by the state Supreme Court in 1933 as unconstitutional. The state constitution requires that property be taxed at a uniform rate, which the court said applied to income in turning down the tax.\u00a0The state also has tight restrictions on the authority of cities to impose such taxes.John Burbank, executive director of the Economic Opportunity Institute, a nonprofit that pushed the Seattle tax measure, said he welcomes the legal challenge: \u201cWe live in a much different society and polity now than 80 years ago.\u201dThe Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit that has fought tax measures in the past, is readying for a legal battle. \u201cThose who oppose this new tax are right on the law,\u201d said David Dewhirst, litigation counsel for the Freedom Foundation. \u201cThe problem is we have a very political court, you can\u2019t at all depend on them adhering to that.\u201dThe state has the most regressive tax system in the nation, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group. The state\u2019s poorest 20% of residents, or those making less than $21,000 a year, paying 16.8% of their income and the richest 1%, or those making $507,000 or more, paying 2.4% of their income, according to the group.Seattle residents required to pay the new tax would file with the city. Officials are still working out the details and will have some time to do so because of the expected legal challenge.Write to Zusha Elinson at zusha.elinson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Court Fight Likely for Seattle Tax.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/seattle-effort-to-tax-the-rich-appears-headed-for-court-battle-1500555600", "keywords": ["ed murray,income tax,seattle,taxes,washington state,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 09:00:00", "news_title": "Twitter Crackdown on Abuse Raises Question: Do the Rules Apply to Trump? ", "content": "Twitter Inc.        TWTR -1.80%       said it has clamped down on harassment on its service, a campaign that is forcing the company to confront tricky questions about how it applies its standards.Twitter suspends or restricts accounts for abusive content at 10 times the rate of a year ago, the company said in a media briefing at its San Francisco headquarters this week. Twitter declined to say how many of its 328 million monthly average users are affected.Compared with the previous four months, Twitter over the past four months has removed twice as many new accounts created by repeat offenders banned for abuse, said       Ed Ho,        general manager of consumer product and engineering teams.Over the past year Twitter has increasingly used artificial intelligence to flag potential abuse, instead of leaving detection to users. This marks a drastic change for a company that had been loath to police its platform, former employees say.But tweets posted by President       Donald Trump       on his personal account in recent weeks have raised the question of whether he is violating the social network\u2019s rules. In late June, Mr. Trump ridiculed the appearance of television news host Mika Brzezinski; in July, he posted a doctored video of himself beating up a man whose face had been digitally altered to show the CNN logo.Asked this week whether the site treats Mr. Trump like other users, Twitter\u2019s head of trust and safety,       Del Harvey,        said, \u201cWe apply our policies consistently. Rules are rules.\u201dThose rules ban graphic content, threats of violence and the targeted abuse of others, though comments judged hateful or abusive can be exempted if they are deemed newsworthy. Twitter last year created a Trust and Safety Council made up of safety advocates, academics and researchers to advise it on online safety.\u201cThe Trump tweets are a litmus test for folks in the safety council, folks who work for Twitter and observers on the outside,\u201d says council member       Stephen Balkam,        founder of the nonprofit Family Online Safety Institute. \u201cThere are robust discussions about whether the tweets should be left up or not.\u201dA spokeswoman for Twitter declined to comment on Mr. Trump, citing a policy of not commenting on specific users.The White House has defended the tweets. Deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Americans \u201cknew what they were getting when they elected Donald Trump.\u201dHow Twitter applies harassment policies to public figures versus ordinary users suggests the limits of its willingness to censor. To keep users from abandoning the site for fear of being harassed, Twitter is slightly restricting free speech, one of its core values. At the same time, Twitter wants to be a hub for news chatter, including controversial views.\u201cFor our democracy, I think we should all see what Trump is saying,\u201d says council member       Danielle Citron,        a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law who studies online harassment. She has advised Twitter since 2009.Other academics disagree. Retired professor       Michael Hawley,        formerly of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, wrote to Twitter in early July urging a temporary ban on Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and official Twitter accounts, @realdonaldtrump and @potus, for violating the terms of service.\u201cSuch tweets have the effect of promoting abusive behavior, or worse, stimulating real violence,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets have drawn rebuke from lawmakers from both parties. Republicans including Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and       Ben Sasse       of Nebraska have asked him to stop targeting people. \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal and it\u2019s beneath the dignity of your office,\u201d Sen. Sasse tweeted.How Twitter polices what people can say on its network has evolved significantly in the past several years. In 2012, Twitter\u2019s then-chief executive, Dick Costolo, said: \u201cWe are the free-speech wing of the free-speech party.\u201dBut when user growth started to stagnate in late 2015, some executives pointed to abuse on the platform as a cause, according to a former Twitter employee. A tipping point was reached when       Milo Yiannopoulos,        then a conservative political commentator at Breitbart, helped lead an online attack against actress       Leslie Jones.       His followers sent her racist and sexist comments. Ms. Jones quit Twitter temporarily.Twitter created the Trust and Safety council, rolled out tools to stop the creation of new abusive accounts and added filters so users can control what content they see.Accounts that Twitter temporarily restricts for posting abusive content now generate 25% fewer abuse reports after restrictions are lifted than they did in February, when Twitter started doing this. Part of the challenge, Ms. Harvey says, is Twitter users all have different levels of sensitivity to content.\u201cThis is something we\u2019re going to be in for the long haul,\u201d Ms. Harvey said.Write to Georgia Wells at Georgia.Wells@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-crackdown-on-abuse-raises-question-do-the-rules-apply-to-trump-1500555604", "keywords": ["trump tweets,trump twitter,twitter abuse,twitter harassment,twitter rules,twitter standards,Twitter,TWTR,Donald Trump,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 08:41:00", "news_title": "PayPal, J.P.

Morgan\u2019s Chase Pay service, a smartphone application the bank launched last year to drive usage of its credit and debt cards for in-store and internet purchases.The deal, which is expected to be fully rolled out by 2018, will also make it easier for its customers to load their J.P. Morgan cards into PayPal\u2019s rival application and let them use their reward points to pay for goods and services through PayPal.\u201cThese are parallel strategies,\u201d said       Jennifer Roberts,        the J.P. Morgan executive overseeing Chase Pay. \u201cWe want to be where our customers are.\u201dThe rapid growth in mobile-payment transactions has drawn interest from firms from a variety of industries, from smartphone makers like Apple Inc. to credit-card networks like Visa Inc. and retailers like             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,       and led them to develop their own digital wallets to capitalize on the opportunity.The volume of mobile online retail payments in the U.S. is expected to reach nearly $319 billion in 2020, up from $122 billion in 2015, according to consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research.PayPal has a leg-up over many of those other companies thanks to its nearly 20-year history in e-commerce. The company says it has 94 million active U.S. customers, and analysts at             Morgan Stanley                   said last year that PayPal was accepted at 73% of large internet retailers.Since last summer, the San Jose, Calif-based company has been angling to handle more payments that happen at physical retailers.The J.P. Morgan agreement enables its cardholders to pay via PayPal in brick-and-mortar stores. Previously signed deals gave the same option to PayPal users who hold cards issued by             Citigroup Inc.,Discover Financial Services                   and Wells Fargo & Co as well as users of Android Pay and             Samsung                   Pay.\u201cA lot of their customers are already in a PayPal environment,\u201d said       Jim Magats,        PayPal\u2019s head of payments, product and engineering. \u201cThey see the opportunity [to] create a better experience.\u201dThe latest agreement is expected to help solve a different problem for J.P. Morgan. Chase Pay is accepted as a payment method at big merchants such as             Starbucks Corp.       and             Best Buy Co.       but relatively few big e-commerce and technology businesses.As part of the new deal, PayPal is expected to add support for Chase Pay as a payment method for merchants who process payments through Braintree, a PayPal subsidiary that counts companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc.Despite this latest partnership, J.P. Morgan and PayPal will still compete in other areas.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast 243,000 new claims.Last week\u2019s claims were near the lowest level recorded since 1973, but the data comes with the caveat that seasonally adjusted figures can be choppy in early July due to temporary factory shutdowns that vary from year to year.Jobless claims generally have hovered near four-decade lows in recent months, suggesting that employers are holding on to workers.The four-week moving average of initial claims, which evens out weekly volatility, decreased by 2,250 last week to 243,750.The number of claims drawn by workers for longer than a week\u2014so-called continuing claims\u2014grew 28,000 to 1.977 million in the week ended July 8.

But there\u2019s one apparent bright spot\u2014fewer bonds are going bad.The number of defaults on Chinese corporate bonds dropped to just 23 in the first half of the year, on debt worth a combined 18.7 billion yuan ($2.8 billion)\u2014a drop in the ocean in a $4.9 trillion market. That\u2019s down from 38 bonds worth 23.7 billion yuan in the first half of 2016, according to data provider WIND Info.A steady performance from China\u2019s economy has helped corporate earnings. Steel and coal companies, among the heaviest bond issuers in recent years, have benefited from higher commodity prices.\u201cThe seemingly better performance of bond defaults was to a large extent due to the significant rebound in steel and coal prices, thanks to Beijing\u2019s strong efforts to cut overcapacity in those industries,\u201d said       Zhang Shuncheng,        analyst at Fitch Ratings.Note: 10 trillion yuan=$1.48 trillionSource: Wind InfoA drop in defaults might encourage foreign investors, who have greater access to China\u2019s bond market than in the past. Last year, Beijing scrapped many restrictions on foreign investment in domestic bonds, and earlier this month it opened the so-called Bond Connect trading link, which enables global investors in Hong Kong to invest in bonds traded on the mainland.Still, some say the low default level may be a warning sign\u2014a reflection of Beijing\u2019s history of bailing out state-owned companies in financial trouble. While good for bondholders in the short term, bailouts can hinder the development of a market where credit risk is priced properly.Corporate debt has ballooned to around 150% of China\u2019s GDP as companies rely ever more on borrowed money to support themselves and grow. And recently the cost of borrowing has risen: The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond now stands at 3.59%, just below the 29-month high of 3.69% it hit in early May. With some 4.41 trillion yuan\u2019s worth of corporate bonds due to mature this year, looking to refinance could face higher costs.\u201cThe fundamentals of China\u2019s corporate bond market have actually deteriorated a lot and the risk of more defaults down the road isn\u2019t going away at all,\u201d said Fitch\u2019s Mr. Zhang.Some analysts say bond issuance is a better indicator than defaults: Chinese companies raised two trillion yuan via corporate bond sales in the first half of 2017, less than half the year-earlier 4.2 trillion yuan.With more Chinese corporate debt maturing than is being issued, net bond financing in the first half was a negative 251.3 billion yuan\u2014 the first time it has turned negative for a six-month period\u2014compared with a positive 1.92 trillion yuan the first half of 2016.

The spot has been unoccupied for nearly three years.Mr. Laguarta\u2019s current duties will be given to       Laxman Narasimhan,        who will continue to oversee the snack-and-beverage giant\u2019s Latin America division. Both appointments will take effect Sept. 1.In an interview, Ms. Nooyi, 61 years old, said she intends to keep running the Purchase, N.Y.-based company \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The two promotions are the latest in a series of moves over the past few years to \u201cstretch\u201d executives and prepare them to be contenders for the top job, she said. The company\u2019s division heads will continue to report to her.The leading internal candidates to succeed Ms. Nooyi include Mr. Laguarta, Mr. Narasimhan and       Hugh Johnston,        PepsiCo\u2019s chief financial officer, who in 2015 was named vice chairman and put in charge of e-commerce and information technology.PepsiCo, which has a market value of about $165 billion, has been using higher prices, smaller packaging and a broader product portfolio to help boost results amid shifting consumer tastes that are pressuring the packaged-food and beverage industries. Despite falling soda demand and other industry challenges, the company\u2019s profit margins are rising and its shares are trading near all-time highs.During Ms. Nooyi\u2019s 11-year tenure, two potential successors have been promoted to the No. 2 role of president only to leave the company later on. The job has been vacant since the 2014 departure of       Zein Abdalla.Ms. Nooyi, who was chief financial officer and president before she was named chief executive in 2006, said Mr. Laguarta shouldn\u2019t be presumed to be her successor.She took over as chairman in 2007 and led the spinoff of             Yum Brands Inc.       as well as acquisitions of Tropicana and Quaker Oats. She has fended off calls to break up the company and has pushed into healthier snacks and beverages.\u201cThere is no heir apparent,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the time comes for succession, whenever it is, I think the wonderful thing is our board is going to have so many people to choose from.\u201dMr. Laguarta, 53, a native of Barcelona, joined the company in 1996 and has spent most of his career rising through the ranks of the European operations. He has an M.B.A. from Spain\u2019s ESADE business school. He speaks English, Spanish, French, German, Greek and Catalan and will relocate to the U.S. from Geneva in his new role.Mr. Narasimhan, 50, was previously a senior partner at McKinsey & Co., where he spent 19 years before joining PepsiCo in 2012. He worked as senior vice president and finance chief at PepsiCo Americas Foods before rising to Latin America chief in 2014.Ms. Nooyi said she wanted Mr. Laguarta, whom she called \u201ca great operating executive,\u201d to gain experience at the corporate headquarters, where his mandate will be to increase sales and productivity to fund investments, she said.Meanwhile, she said she wanted to push Mr. Narasimhan to \u201clift and shift ideas\u201d across Europe, Africa and Latin America to accelerate his divisions\u2019 growth. He has \u201cevolved from brilliant strategist to a very good operating executive,\u201d Ms. Nooyi said.As Mr. Laguarta takes on some of Ms. Nooyi\u2019s responsibilities, she said she would turn her focus to PepsiCo\u2019s future.

EBAY 1.98%       is scheduled to announce its second-quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday.

(The company earned 38 cents a share unadjusted.) The company forecast adjusted second-quarter earnings of between 43 cents and 45 cents.REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue of $2.31 billion is forecast by the analysts, compared with $2.23 billion a year ago. EBay expected revenue of between $2.28 billion and $2.32 billion.WHAT TO WATCH:--STRUCTURED DATA: Investors will be looking for updates to eBay\u2019s all-important structured-data initiative, in which the company is making its site more searchable in part by grouping single listings into browsable categories. Executives in the first quarter said that the initiative was drawing more traffic to those pages. It\u2019s part of the company\u2019s broader push to become more modern and move away from its legacy image as an online garage sale.

But over the past three years, workers have received increases in pay and benefits totaling about 10% annually.Mr. White, the company\u2019s president, calls the raises \u201ca proactive strike\u201d designed to keep his 35-person team in place. \u201cBusiness is better, so we are able to do it,\u201d he added.Even with the latest increases, wage growth at small firms is only now approaching that of larger companies, which typically pay more than small firms. The increase is being fueled by heightened demand for employees and websites like PayScale and Glassdoor that make it easier for both workers and bosses to see what competitors pay.Wage growth for existing employees accelerated by 1.07% annually over the past three years at companies with fewer than 50 employees, according to an analysis of ADP data by Moody\u2019s Analytics for The Wall Street Journal\u2014well above the 0.69% average increase for firms of all sizes over the same period.Small businesses are feeling the pressure, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said. \u201cThey have to work harder to keep employees now that the labor market is tight.\u201dThere were 5.7 million job openings in May, the latest month for which data were available, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.According to a June survey of roughly 800 companies by the Journal and Vistage Worldwide Inc., 58% of small-business owners reported increased difficulties finding needed workers. Many have responded by boosting pay or benefits, while others have stepped up training or slowed the pace of growth.Craig Zoberis, president of Fusion OEM, a contract manufacturer outside Chicago, has raised hourly pay for entry-level workers by $1 for each of the past three years. Over the past two years, he has also stepped up efforts to reward the best employees on his production floor, who can now see their pay jump by as much as 73% over a four-year period.\u201cWith the competition going on for top employees, we had to meet and exceed what the marketplace is looking for,\u201d he said.But rising pay is also burdening small firms, which typically operate with thinner margins than their bigger competitors. With wages up, \u201cthere are things we are scrimping on,\u201d said Julie Irwin, owner of Spectrum Building & Restoration Corp. and a Servpro franchise in Bend, Ore., which recently gave new and existing employees raises of as much as 10% to 20% to keep competitors from poaching them.She has been forced to delay purchases of new vehicles and tools for the 23-person contracting firm, which specializes in fire and water damage cleanup and restoration. \u201cWe are making do with what we have,\u201d she said.Younger workers\u2014those under age 35\u2014are capturing the biggest pay increases, according to the Moody\u2019s Analytics analysis.At Gold Systems Inc., a software firm in Salt Lake City, Utah, \u201cyear two and year three salaries are much higher than they used to be,\u201d said owner Dave Wilcox, noting that $10,000 raises have become more common for employees with starting salaries of $50,000 to $60,000. Younger workers come to the negotiating table well-armed, he said, with spreadsheets and reports detailing how much money they should make and what competitors pay.Higher salaries for new workers are also driving broader pay adjustments. Matt Haney, chief executive of Universal Network Solutions Inc., an information technology consultancy in Minneapolis, boosted pay by 12% to 17% over the past two years after experienced workers realized that they earned less than new hires.\u201cWe had unknowingly fallen behind and had to make up for that,\u201d he said.Some entrepreneurs concede they will never be able to match the pay and benefits offered by bigger companies. Scott Karman, owner of Silver Fox Productions Inc., a Seattle graphic design firm, lost three designers in the past year to corporations promising 50% to 100% more in their pay packages.Even though it wasn\u2019t hard to fill the open positions, Mr. Karman said he would like to boost retention. He rolled out a bonus plan that can be scaled up and down with business conditions and has added perks, such as occasionally bringing in lunch or a masseuse to the office.\u201cI don\u2019t want my talent to go to competitors,\u201d he said.Write to Ruth Simon at ruth.simon@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-small-firms-are-giving-out-15-pay-raises-1500552000", "keywords": ["employee raises,labor market,pay raises,raises,small business,small business wages,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,small,medium businesses,workers pay,political,general news,crime,legal action,general labor issues"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 07:37:00", "news_title": "CMO Today: Univision Fields M&A Interest; Amazon Pays Publishers for Posts; Publicis and Omnicom Q2", "content": "Good morning. Lots of earnings are out today. We\u2019ll get to the advertising company ones in a second, but it\u2019s worth taking a moment to look at how one of the world\u2019s biggest ad spenders got on. Unilever reported a sharp rise in profit in the first half of 2017 and said it plans a \u201cstep-up in brand and marketing investment\u201d in the second half. That\u2019s good news for media owners and the agencies that work with the CPG giant, although the results mention that its \u201czero-based budgeting\u201d strategy to reduce the cost of advertising production isn\u2019t going away anytime soon.Another day, more media M&A. The latest to step into the frame is Univision, owner of the dominant Spanish-language broadcaster of the same name in the U.S., The Wall Street Journal reports. Cable mogul John Malone held early talks with Univision\u2019s financial backers about a potential deal. Univision\u2019s owners, a collection of private-equity firms, have been hunting for an exit for years and registered for an IPO in 2015. An IPO this year still seems unlikely, given the weak performance of media stocks. Mr. Malone is everywhere nowadays: he\u2019s a backer of Discovery Communications, which WSJ reported this week is in talks to buy Scripps, was behind the roll-up of QVC and Home Shopping Network, and is scouting a potential wireless deal with Sprint. Univision\u2019s young-skewing audience has made it appealing, but its ratings lead over rival Telemundo has narrowed and its debt burden is a concern.Amazon is paying publishers and social media influencers to post to its new social network, Spark, CMO Today\u2019s Jack Marshall reports. Spark works like Pinterest, but looks more like Instagram. It encourages users to share images and videos and tag the products contained within them so people can buy them through Amazon. A feed full of adverts, essentially. I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll take off. Publishers are being paid a flat fee for a specific amount of posts to the new social network, rather than taking a revenue share from the items bought. It seems you have to be prepared to pony up if you\u2019re going to convince webstars to weave their influence on new channels these days. Remember, Facebook was reportedly spending tens of millions of dollars to get publishers to produce Facebook Live video last year. Speaking of Facebook cozying up to publishers, WSJ\u2019s Lukas Alpert reports that the social network is partnering with Nielsen to give news outlets more data on how their stories are performing on the platform.Arthur Sadoun marked his first quarterly earnings since taking over as Publicis Groupe CEO. Publicis Media CEO Steve King also got a lot of stage time on the earnings call, too, fielding the tough questions about media, while Mr. Sadoun outlined his vision for transforming Publicis. While the numbers weren\u2019t magnifique, they beat analysts\u2019 estimates, as the WSJ\u2019s Nick Kostov reported. The advertising holding company returned to organic growth (0.8%, versus estimates of a 0.5% decline) in the second quarter, having battled through a tough 2016. Publicis credited the improvement of its business in North America and the impact of new account wins including Walmart, Motorola, HPE, Asda, USAA and Lowe\u2019s. The outlook is looking rosier, too. Publicis said it expects to \u201creturn to a growth rate comparable with our peers\u201d in the second half of the year. Omnicom also reported earnings today, posting organic growth of 3.5% in its second quarter.Rap facts: Hip-hop makes you hungry. Or at least that\u2019s what Chipotle is banking on with its latest marketing push. The food chain is looking to get people back through the doors after customers fell ill having eaten in one of its restaurant this week. Chipotle has called upon Wu-Tang Clan rapper RZA to help design its new website, Bloomberg reports.

The central bank now sees the target being reached by March 2020, five years after Mr. Kuroda\u2019s initial timing.The BOJ also kept its main interest rates on hold and looks set to dig in for some time with its ultraloose policy while the Federal Reserve and some other major central banks raise rates and the European Central Bank hints at scaling back its stimulus.Mr. Kuroda, whose term ends next year, said the frequent inflation revisions were regrettable but wouldn\u2019t affect the BOJ\u2019s credibility.\u201cCentral banks in the U.S. and Europe have also pushed back the timing to achieve their inflation targets a few times. There are some factors that are just too difficult for a central bank to control or predict, such as falls in oil prices,\u201d the governor told a news conference.However, many economists said they think even the BOJ\u2019s latest forecasts are unrealistic.In its quarterly economic outlook released Thursday, the central bank said core consumer prices excluding fresh food would likely rise by an average of 1.1% in the year ending March 2018, down from a 1.4% increase forecast in April. The bank lowered its inflation projection for the year ending March 2019 to 1.5% from a previous forecast of 1.7%. The headline inflation rate was 0.4% in May, the most recent data available.On average, economists believe that the inflation rate is likely to fall short of 1% this year and next, according to a July survey conducted by the Japan Center for Economic Research, a think tank.\u201cIt was inevitable for the BOJ to lower its inflation forecasts because previous views were impossible to achieve,\u201d said SMBC Nikko Securities chief economist Junichi Makino.Japan\u2019s struggle to meet the BOJ\u2019s price target comes despite brighter signs elsewhere. The bank raised its economic assessment and said growth in the year ending March 2018 was likely to reach 1.8%, up from an earlier forecast of 1.6%.Central bankers around the world are trying to figure out how inflation can remain so weak while economic growth gathers momentum\u2014a factor that usually drives up prices.Retailers in Japan have pointed to price-slashing e-commerce sites as one possible cause. Thursday\u2019s BOJ economic outlook cited possible improvements in productivity as another reason companies might be able to avoid price increases.With the targeted inflation rate expected to take longer to arrive, the board kept its target for 10-year Japanese government bond yields at around zero and its short-term deposit rate at minus 0.1%, as expected. The bank also reiterated its promise to buy government bonds at an annual rate of \u00a580 trillion ($715 billion), which investors saw as a gauge of its commitment to easing, even though the pace of purchases has already slowed to below that level.Mr. Kuroda said current policies could maintain or strengthen upward momentum in prices.The BOJ governor\u2019s \u201cextraordinary easing appears to be endless because the bank aims for impossible\u2014that is, 2% inflation, which is too high compared with the ability of the Japanese economy and the inflation view of the Japanese people,\u201d said Mizuho Securities chief market economist Yasunari Ueno.Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com and Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Japan Extends Inflation Timetable.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-japan-pushes-back-inflation-target-time-frame-1500521081", "keywords": ["bank of japan,bank of japan policy decision,Haruhiko Kuroda,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 07:00:00", "news_title": "The Hottest Field in Law?

For larger firms, the average is $691,000, with one reporting spending $5 million.Attorneys have received accolades for decades. Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton used to tout that she was one of the National Law Journal\u2019s \u201c100 Most Influential Lawyers\u201d in 1988 and 1991.But since the recession, the awards race has intensified, in part as legal-trade publications look to monetize honors to prop up revenue.Many of the rankings are bestowed by trusted brands that vet lawyers\u2019 reputations by calling clients and reviewing court victories or major deals. Even these can ask winners to pay $500 for plaques, $5,000 for advertisements or $10,000 for tables at awards banquets. Newer contests are often pay-to-play, requiring several-hundred dollar submission fees or even withholding awards if certain products aren\u2019t purchased.\u201cA whole cottage industry has developed on playing off of lawyers\u2019 egos and insecurities,\u201d said the head of one large New York-based law firm. \u201cIt\u2019s accelerating dramatically because people see that there\u2019s money to be had.\u201dMany law firms say the awards do more to help internal morale than to acquire new business. In a 2016 survey of general counsel by BTI, 4.6% said they looked to the attorney directories first when hiring law firms, while 25% said they use them to confirm observations about a hire.Chambers USA\u2019s editor,       Toby Eccleshall,        said they hear about clients who rely on the guide. \u201cIt\u2019s not just intended to be a vanity project for lawyers,\u201d he said. Super Lawyers, which awards the distinction to up to 5% of lawyers in each state, serves as a starting point to \u201chelp consumers navigate the legal realm,\u201d publisher       Cindy Larson       said.Faced with a stagnant supply of high-end litigation and corporate deal work, law firms see the awards as a way to distinguish themselves and get an edge on the competition.Joseph Andrew, global chairman of 8,000-lawyer law firm Dentons, said awards have gained prominence as firms compete internationally and recognize the value of sharing successes on social media. \u201cIf you\u2019re the world\u2019s largest law firm, you want to make sure you\u2019ve won more awards than anyone else,\u201d Mr. Andrew said.Law-firm marketers say they have become accustomed to almost daily emails from partners forwarding awards pitches and asking some variation of \u201cdo we care about this?\u201d One recently making the rounds to Manhattan attorneys congratulates them on their nomination as one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Top 100 Attorneys\u201d in New York, listing 79 other lawyers who have already \u201caccepted this honor\u201d and a link to pay $1,000 onetime membership dues.Topping that list is Gary Naftalis, a name partner at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, a firm based in New York.Mr. Naftalis, whose website bio lists dozens of honors he has received in his more than 40-year career representing chief executives and major corporations, said he didn\u2019t know he was being used in promotional materials. \u201cLook, obviously everybody has egos,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you work hard, if you\u2019re good at what you do, it\u2019s nice to be recognized.\u201dSome marketing professionals are getting fed up with endless nomination requests and have begun to push back\u2014and urge attorneys to be more discerning. Ms. Braverman said attendees cheered at a marketing conference earlier this year when a senior-in house lawyer said he didn\u2019t care about rankings.Kent Matsumoto, general counsel of specialty-paper maker Glatfelter, said he hires lawyers who show an interest in the industry and can serve as an extension of the company, qualities he says that can\u2019t be ascertained in a lawyer directory.As awards makers tap out the law-firm market, some have started conferring prizes on corporations\u2019 law departments, then asking law firms to take out advertisements to congratulate their clients.Edward Ryan, the general counsel of Marriott International, said he weighs the prestige and value of an accolade against the pressure it would put on law firms he hires to buy tables at awards dinners. So, he politely declines some, but accepts others.\u201cIt can be hard to celebrate your successes,\u201d he said. \u201cRecognition from an outside source really helps people say, wow, we did something special.\u201dWrite to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hottest-field-in-law-ranking-the-lawyers-1500548400", "keywords": ["attorney rankings,best lawyers,lawyer rankings,legal profession,marketing,martindale-hubbell,super lawyer,who's who,Cindy Larson,Toby Eccleshall,corporate,industrial news,legal services,business,consumer services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 07:00:00", "news_title": "Happy 100th Birthday! There Goes Your Life Insurance ", "content": "When       Gary Lebbin       turns 100 years old in September, hanging over any celebration will be one very costly fact: His life insurer aims to cancel two policies totaling $3.2 million in death benefits.The Lebbin family has run up against a provision that exists in many life-insurance policies. Policies have expiration dates, and the one in the Lebbin family\u2019s two contracts is age 100 for the policyholder.It is a standard feature of permanent life insurance, a product combining a tax-deferred savings component with a tax-free death-benefit. The provision calls for the termination of the death benefit and payout of all of the built-up savings when the policyholder reaches the specified age.The limits weren\u2019t an issue in the many decades when very few people lived beyond 100. But they increasingly are a problem for the U.S. life-insurance industry as more people become centenarians. There were an estimated 53,364 centenarians in the U.S. as of 2010, up from 37,306 in 1990 and 32,194 in 1980, according to a U.S. Census report published in December 2012.Since the mid- to late-2000s, the industry has used age 121 as the standard maturity date in new contracts. But an unknown number of older contracts with the 100-year-old limit remain in consumers\u2019 hands. Some insurers previously offered older policyholders the opportunity to extend the age in their older policies with varying financial terms.The Lebbin family\u2019s insurer, a unit of Transamerica Corp., didn\u2019t offer an extension.Lawrence Rybka,        president of insurance brokerage Valmark Financial Group in Akron, Ohio, worries many people may unexpectedly lose out. At least seven people have recently contacted his firm with questions about older policies with maturity dates of 95 to 100 years. \u201cContract language of this type was common practice,\u201d he said.Faced with the potential loss of coverage, Mr. Lebbin\u2019s family filed suit in federal court in Maryland earlier this month, accusing Transamerica of knowingly using a too-low age at the time of sale in the early 1990s. The suit also alleges the insurer improperly marketed the policies as \u201ccoverage for life.\u201dThe federal-court lawsuit says the Lebbins paid Transamerica more than $1.5 million in premiums over the years. It seeks revision of the contracts to allow coverage until Mr. Lebbin\u2019s death. It also seeks an award including punitive and other damages.In a statement, Transamerica, a unit of the Netherlands\u2019s             Aegon                   NV, says it acted properly.\u201cWe understand that Mr. Lebbin is disappointed that his life insurance coverage will shortly come to an end. However, his policies, according to their terms, pay benefits only if he were to pass away before the policies\u2019 anniversaries nearest age 100\u2026We take seriously our obligations to the millions of customers who rely on the solutions we provide and we abide fully by the terms and conditions of our policy contracts,\u201d according to the statement.In terminating the policy, Transamerica said it would pay Mr. Lebbin the built-up \u201cnet cash value,\u201d or savings. That is as per contractual terms.It is unclear how much cash value there is, said       James Bainbridge,        a lawyer for the family. Industrywide, many of these policies have performed poorly in recent years because interest buildup is tied to the insurers\u2019 bond investments, and low interest rates have had a punishing effect. Upon termination of the policies, the Lebbin family would collect less money and potentially pay taxes, while a future $3.2 million death benefit would be tax-free, Mr. Bainbridge said.\u201cTransamerica has a public-relations problem because it didn\u2019t think ahead and offer policyholders like these\u201d options at an earlier stage to deal with the looming age issue, said       Todd Erkis,        a former chief actuary at             Lincoln National Corp.       and a visiting professor at St. Joseph\u2019s University.Ironically, policy maturity dates were born as a way to help consumers get a reasonable value out of a policy after years of ownership but before a death, said       Paul Graham,        a senior actuary with the American Council of Life Insurers. To calculate monetary values and set annual premium levels, \u201cyou have to have an end point,\u201d he said.By the mid 2000s, a new mortality table was available that established 121 as the new maturity age to help prevent an abundance of policies maturing before death, according to Mr. Graham.\u201cThe agents didn\u2019t want the policies maturing before people were dying, the companies didn\u2019t want it happening, and policyholders didn\u2019t want it happening,\u201d he said.The policies taken out by the Lebbins are called universal life. They are a popular form of permanent life insurance. Permanent life stands in contrast to basic \u201cterm\u201d life, which is sold to provide a payout if a death occurs within a specified period of time, usually 10 to 30 years.The suit alleges Transamerica marketed the policies as coverage that would insure the Lebbins for life and would guarantee they would have tax-free income with which their heirs could pay estate taxes. The lawsuit maintains that Transamerica established the maturity date with a 1980 mortality table \u201cdespite the fact that it was outdated and not an accurate reflection of the actual life expectancies of its customers.\u201dThe Lebbins became aware last year of Transamerica\u2019s intention to terminate the policies and unsuccessfully sought an extension of the contracts until Mr. Lebbin\u2019s death, the lawsuit says.Mr. Lebbin was born on Sept. 6, 1917, in Berlin. He came to the U.S. in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution, according to his son-in-law       Phillip Spector.      \u00a0From arriving penniless, he founded a paint-manufacturing business in the 1940s and ultimately had more than 50 retail outlets in the Baltimore-Washington area.He married in 1944. Bernice Lebbin died in 2015.\u201cCentenarians are cherished and routinely honored by local communities and governments,\u201d said Mr. Bainbridge, the lawyer. \u201cCentenarians, however, are problematic for the life-insurance industry.\u201dWrite to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'This Life Insurance Isn\u2019t So Permanent.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/happy-100th-birthday-there-goes-your-life-insurance-1500548402", "keywords": ["Transamerica,Aegon,NL:AGN,Gary Lebbin,Lawrence Rybka,commodity,financial market news,insurance,life insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 07:00:00", "news_title": "GE Earnings: What to Watch ", "content": "General Electric Co.        GE 0.59%       is set to report second-quarter earnings before the market opens on Friday. Here is what you need to know:EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings per share of 25 cents, compared with adjusted earnings per share of 51 cents during the same period last year.REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts project revenue of $29.02 billion, down from $33.49 billion a year earlier.WHAT TO WATCH:END OF AN ERA: Friday\u2019s conference call is to be       Jeffrey Immelt\u2019s       last one after running the industrial giant for 16 years. Critics point out the poor stock performance during that time, while his fans say he was dealt a tough hand and has navigated crises and exited multiple unattractive businesses, including media, insurance, financial services and virtually all consumer products. Mr. Immelt will remain chairman until the end of the year but hands over the CEO keys to       John Flannery       on Aug. 1. Both will be on the call.CASH FLOW: Wall Street was blindsided in April by a negative cash flow of $1.6 billion from industrial operating activities, $1 billion below GE\u2019s own target. The company blamed the shortfall on the timing of inventory and orders and has since reiterated its goal of $12 billion to $14 billion of positive industrial cash flow by the end of the year, up from $11.6 billion in 2016. GE typically does more business in the second half of the year, but investors are looking for reassurance that the guidance is plausible.OUTLOOK: Investors are waiting for GE to walk back from its long-held 2018 earnings goal of $2 a share. Analyst estimates have dropped to $1.81, according to Thomson Reuters, and GE has said $2 is now at the high end and will require more cost-cutting. Will GE rip the Band-Aid off now or wait until later when Mr. Flannery is running the show?COST CUTS: GE plans to trim $1 billion in its industrial business for each of the next two years. After working with activist Trian Fund Management, GE increased its planned cuts and tied executive bonuses more closely to core business performance. Mr. Flannery is expected by many on Wall Street to continue the cutting and possibly restructure the sprawling conglomerate.BAKER HUGHES                        : GE earlier this month closed a deal to put its long-struggling oil and gas business together with Baker Hughes Inc. to create a new GE-controlled public company providing equipment and services to major oil producers.

Here\u2019s what to expect.EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expect Microsoft to report adjusted per-share earnings of 71 cents, up from 69 cents a year earlier. Adjusted results exclude items such as deferred revenue and restructuring charges. A year ago, the company reported net of 39 cents a share.REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect Microsoft to post adjusted revenue of $24.29 billion, up from $22.64 billion a year earlier. The adjusted number reflects Windows 10 revenue deferrals.WHAT TO WATCH:\u2014CLOUDY CONDITIONS: Microsoft continues to ramp up its business of selling web-based, on-demand computing processing and storage. Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback estimated in a recent research note that Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud-computing business grew about 87% in the quarter to $1.1 billion, continuing \u201cto close the gap\u201d with market pioneer and leader             Amazon.com Inc.       In the fiscal third quarter, Azure revenue grew 93%. He credited Microsoft\u2019s \u201cmaturing product offering\u201d as well as its ability to sell hybrid offerings that combine cloud services with software that runs in customers\u2019 own data centers. Microsoft\u2019s commercial-cloud run-rate\u2014the last month of sales of its Azure and Office 365 products, multiplied by 12\u2014should hit $18 billion, up 49% year-over-year, Mr. Reback estimated.\u2014DATA-CENTER SPENDING: To handle its growing cloud business, Microsoft needs to build costly data centers around the globe. The company, along with Amazon and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google, spent a combined $31.54 billion in 2016 in capital expenditures and capital leases, up 22% from 2015, according to company filings. That rate of spending is likely to continue as Microsoft works to keep pace with its rivals, in turn making it more costly for would-be competitors to catch up. Mr. Reback estimated Microsoft will post $3 billion in capital expenses in the quarter, bringing the company\u2019s fiscal year total to $8.9 billion. He expects the annual number to climb to $11.4 billion in the current fiscal year.\u2014SURFACING SALES: Three months ago, the biggest blemish on Microsoft\u2019s results was a 26% decline in revenue from the company\u2019s Surface line of computers. At the time, Microsoft attributed the slide to older Surface computers in the market, as well as increased price competition. Since then, Microsoft has rolled out a new Surface laptop for the education market, and an update to its Surface Pro tablet-laptop hybrid device. Those products, though, became available toward the end of the quarter and aren\u2019t likely to have factored much into the company\u2019s top line.\u2014SHRINKING WINDOWS: Sales of personal computers, the vast majority of which run Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, continue to decline. Last week, International Data Corp. reported world-wide PC shipments fell 3.3% in the second quarter, while             Gartner Inc.       estimated the drop at 4.3%. Since More Personal Computing, comprised largely of Windows revenue, remains Microsoft\u2019s largest segment, PC declines continue to dog the company\u2019s results.

It is starting to look more like one.Goldman\u2019s 450 or so partners own just 4.8% of the firm today, according to a securities filing late Wednesday. That is the lowest level since its initial public offering and slips under a 5% regulatory threshold that for years has mandated public disclosures that opened a window into the sway held by this elite\u00a0inner circle.Going forward, Goldman won\u2019t have to disclose its partners\u2019 stakes, or their buying and selling of the bank\u2019s shares,\u00a0unless the\u00a0group\u2019s collective stake jumps back over 5%.That\u00a0would\u00a0shield from public view when\u00a0partners unload their shares en masse, which happened last winter as Goldman stock touched new highs.The filings\u00a0are the last outward vestige of the old private partnership that once ruled Goldman. The\u00a0document itself is defiantly old-school, using a stripped-down format abandoned by most companies for Securities and Exchange Commission submissions.The private-partnership era, which stretched from Goldman\u2019s 1869 founding to its 1999 IPO, once meant that access to its upper\u00a0echelons meant tying one\u2019s personal fortunes to the firm\u2019s capital.Still, the ritual of selecting partners every two years has remained a vital part of the firm\u2019s identity, a way to reward and motivate its most promising employees and help guard the firm\u2019s culture as Wall Street changes around it.Partner slots carry minimum salaries of about $1 million and bonuses that can be multiples of that. Partners also get access to invest in firm deals and other perks.Goldman\u2019s IPO made its partners much more wealthy. But it also set in motion a slow-motion\u00a0transformation of the firm.\u00a0With more than 95% of its shares held by outside investors, Goldman is now,\u00a0more than ever, a public company.That lesson was hammered home this week, when Goldman faced tough questions from analysts about whether it has moved quickly enough to address weakness in its core trading business.

CSX 0.97%       is telling some shippers to brace for growing pains, including additional days of transit times, as the railway implements Chief Executive       Hunter Harrison\u2019s       plan to tighten schedules.Mr. Harrison, who joined CSX in March, is in the early days of executing the \u201cprecision railroading\u201d that he put in place while leading two of Canada\u2019s largest railways. The strategy includes hewing to more precise schedules but upends some aspects of the Jacksonville, Fla., railroad company\u2019s network, such as shutting down yards that sort long trains and idling hundreds of locomotives and freight cars.During a call with analysts on Wednesday, CSX executives said they have told customers that as they are making these changes, any short-term disruptions would eventually pay off with a better-run railroad and more predictable delivery times.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a little pain and suffering,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, frankly, how to get there without some bumps in the road.\u201dHe added a sentiment he said he is hearing from customers: \u201cWe\u2019re willing to suffer some cuts and bruises along the way, just don\u2019t bruise us too much.\u201dSome of the changes have slowed down freight shipments. In a notice sent to some customers last month, CSX said to allow for an additional 72 hours of transit time for cars moving through a handful of terminals in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and upstate New York as it activates new service plans. According to an executive at a company that is a CSX customer, transit times are up about 48 hours over the last 3\u00bd months.One broader gauge of railroad shippers also shows some problems for CSX. A recent Cowen & Co. survey found 24% of rail customers rated CSX service as \u201cpoor.\u201d No other rail had a \u201cpoor\u201d rating from more than 6% of shippers.Cowen said that CSX\u2019s scores were likely affected by a scaling back in shipping offerings rather than poor quality of service, since CSX trains are running faster and spending less time in terminals.Asked about customer satisfaction overall during Wednesday\u2019s call, CSX\u2019s chief marketing officer,       Fredrik Eliasson,        said: \u201cWe\u2019re asking our customers to hang with us and see what is ultimately on the horizon.\u201dMr. Harrison on Wednesday defended the changes he is making, which came a day after CSX said its second-quarter earnings rose 15% to $510 million on an 8% uptick in revenue.The 72-year-old railway veteran has chafed at the perception that he is focused on cutting costs and jobs and not on customers. \u201cIt\u2019s just that perception, you don\u2019t like customers,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t buy into that.\u201dIn a later interview, Mr. Harrison said that complaints about rail disruption have been rare. \u201cIn the scheme of things, it\u2019s a non-event,\u201d he said, adding that CSX has gained customers recently.CSX\u2019s quarterly results were helped by a one-time infusion of $113 million, stemming from a settlement with a customer that didn\u2019t ship as much with CSX as it normally does and a favorable judgment related to a previously condemned property.The company backed its guidance for the year and boosted its share buyback plans 50% to $1.5 billion. The results still disappointed investors who were hoping for a raised forecast. Its shares fell 6% to $51.40 in afternoon trading.Write to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.comAppeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition as 'CSX Warns of Bumps in the Railroad.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/csx-warns-of-bumps-in-the-road-as-it-tightens-rail-schedules-1500490256", "keywords": ["cargo rail,cargo train,rail,railroad,rail shipping,rail transport,railway,shipping,CSX,Fredrik Eliasson,Hunter Harrison,corporate,industrial news,railroads,freight transport,logistics,road,railroad freight,transportation"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 06:00:00", "news_title": "Reputed Creator of Buffalo Wings to Open NYC Restaurant ", "content": "New York City could finally be getting a true taste of Buffalo\u2014the city, that is.Anchor Bar, the Buffalo, N.Y., dining and drinking spot that claims to have created the Buffalo wing, is close to finalizing a deal to open its first location in the Big Apple, said       Mark Dempsey,        a vice president with the company.The 4,000-square-foot, 200-seat restaurant is slated to open\u00a0in Midtown Manhattan at 327 West 57th\u00a0St.\u00a0in the coming months, Mr. Dempsey said. The restaurant would be run by a franchisee,       Carlos Rosario,        and startup costs would be about $500,000, he said.DNAinfo, a local news site, earlier reported the company\u2019s plan.The move into New York City, Mr. Dempsey said, is a proud moment for Anchor Bar, which opened its flagship location in Buffalo in 1935. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited,\u201d he said.In recent years, the company has opened restaurants in other upstate New York locations, in addition to cities ranging from Richmond, Va., to San Antonio.As for Anchor Bar\u2019s Buffalo wings, they were something of a happy accident, Mr. Dempsey said. When patrons visited the original location one night in 1964 and asked for something different to eat, proprietor       Teressa Bellissimo       came upon some chicken wings and fried and flavored them with hot sauce. And so, a legendary\u2014and spicy\u2014dish was born.Anchor Bar may claim to be the first name in Buffalo wings, but it now competes in a crowded field. New York City already has eight locations of             Buffalo Wild Wings,       a national chain. Countless independent restaurants also serve the wings in numerous varieties.Moreover, there is growing interest in Korean-style wings, which some fowl enthusiasts say have a more appealing texture because they are double-fried for extra crunchiness.\u201cOnce you eat Korean wings, you can\u2019t go back to the Buffalo wing,\u201d said       Mihae Cho,        owner of Roosterspin, a New Jersey restaurant with two locations that specializes in the dish. Ms. Cho said she plans to open more locations in the coming years to meet demand.Still, Anchor does have a \u201cgood back story,\u201d said       Michael Whiteman,        president of Baum + Whiteman, a New York-based restaurant-consulting firm. And given the popularity of wings, once a throwaway part of the chicken, the competition issue might be moot. \u201cThere\u2019s generally room for one more of everything,\u201d Mr. Whiteman noted.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/reputed-creator-of-buffalo-wings-to-open-nyc-restaurant-1500544800", "keywords": ["buffalo wings,new nyc eateries,nyc restaurants,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility openings,political,general news,arts,entertainment"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 05:33:00", "news_title": "Today\u2019s Top Supply Chain and Logistics News From WSJ", "content": "Sign up: With one click, get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.The path to precision railroading isn\u2019t going to be smooth.CSX Corp.

The caution in a conference call on CSX\u2019s strong second-quarter earnings comes as the company is already seeing freight shipments slow down, the WSJ\u2019s Paul Ziobro reports, with some shippers reporting longer transit times and surveyed assessments of CSX service declining. The barbs that Mr. Harrison has favored cost-cutting over service have followed the veteran rail executive at other stops, and he dismisses that as an unjust perception.

The word that the countries would formally open a potential overhaul of the North American Free Trade Agreement came after the Trump administration outlined key goals that include improving access for U.S. goods exported to Canada and Mexico, the WSJ\u2019s William Mauldin reports. That White House also wants much stronger labor standards in a new Nafta, an outcome that could raise labor costs in Mexico and change the economic measures manufacturers have used in shifting factory work from the U.S. to Mexico. That also could bring transportation issues to the table. Federal regulators have allowed a handful of Mexican truckers to continue to operate in the U.S. since a controversial test program called for under Nafta ended in 2014, and some trucking companies and the Teamsters union may raise new objections to the provision.India\u2019s new goods and services tax is upending traditional business processes, and that\u2019s just fine with the country\u2019s truckers. The freight and logistics sector has provided an important success for the government\u2019s major economic initiative, the WSJ\u2019s Corinne Abrams, Debiprasad Nayak and Anant Vijay Kala report, as checkpoints for collecting state taxes have come down and long delays and heavy costs that include bribery have retreated. India\u2019s state-tax system has been part of the country\u2019s notoriously inefficient transportation operations, and a successful overhaul could trigger bigger improvements in infrastructure and changes to lure new foreign investment. The GST\u2019s impact on supply chains hasn\u2019t been all sunny: the enormous textile industry has had disruptions as traders adjust, and some businesses are hunkering down as they get paperwork in order. But the fragmented and inefficient logistics industry is already counting financial gains, and a projected 20% savings in logistics costs could spur more shipping once the new tax system becomes clearer.The legal dispute between             Apple Inc.       and chip supplier             Qualcomm Inc.       is turning into a battle across the electronics production supply chain. Several major smartphone makers, including contract manufacturers for Apple, are joining the company\u2019s claim that Qualcomm has charges excessive licensing fees and violates antitrust laws, the WSJ\u2019s Tripp Mickle reports, expanding a case that now covers some of the technology world\u2019s biggest factory operators. Taiwan-based contract manufacturers             Foxconn Technology                   Group,             Compal Electronics Inc.Pegatron Corp.       and             Wistron Corp.       jumped into the fight with a lawsuit against Qualcomm filed in federal court in San Diego this week. That suit comes as Qualcomm filed a new complaint against Apple in Germany looking to stop the shipping of the company\u2019s new iPhone into the country\u2014mirroring the chip maker\u2019s moves earlier this month to block imports of some Apple devices into the U.S. Getting the contract manufacturers into the fray raises the stakes for both Qualcomm and Apple.\u2018There\u2019s going to be a little pain and suffering.

Some groups, like Boko Haram, controlled huge territory. Other Islamic State \u201cprovinces,\u201d such as the one in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus, consisted of scattered militants on the run.In any case, the conflicts in which all these \u201cprovinces\u201d thrived preceded Islamic State\u2019s 2014 proclamation. And even after the recent liberation of Mosul and the impending collapse of Islamic State\u2019s second-largest stronghold of Raqqa, in Syria, these distant conflicts will persist, following their own individual dynamics.\u201cOperationally, the fall of Mosul changes nothing because every one of these groups is autonomous from Islamic State central,\u201d said Mathieu Guidere, a terrorism expert at the University of Toulouse. \u201cThe only impact is psychological\u2014these groups will fear that something like what happened to Mosul will happen to them, and will draw their lessons.\u201dIn fact, just as Iraqi troops were mopping up the last pockets of resistance in Mosul, Islamic State\u2019s Asian affiliate halfway around the world attempted a dramatic takeover of Marawi, one of the largest Muslim cities on the southern Philippines island of Mindanao. The battle there still goes on.\u201cIslamic State is a very resilient organization, it\u2019s not one single group but a movement now,\u201d said Rohan Gunaratna, head of the International Center for Political Violence and Terrorism Research at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. \u201cAnd because the world has no real strategy to contain, isolate and eliminate Islamic State beyond Iraq and Syria, we will see a significant global expansion of this group.\u201dAsia, home to many more Muslims than the Middle East, is a particular concern. \u201cWe should prepare for a Daesh pivot to Asia. Opportunities are limitless here because it is a very deep market,\u201d said Richard Javad Heydarian, a security analyst in the Philippines, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. \u201cPlaces like Mindanao are a perfect haven: borders are extremely porous and it\u2019s easy to travel from Malaysia and Indonesia, while the depth of grievances of the Muslim minority in the southern region of the Philippines provides an ecosystem for extremism.\u201dWhile Islamic State\u2014routed from much of its territory in Syria and Iraq\u2014no longer has the winning momentum that once made it so attractive to potential jihadists, the organization has left a permanent mark on the motley assortment of militant groups that joined its caliphate project.\u201cDaesh has already done its damage, transforming the local groups ideologically and operationally,\u201d said Muhammad Amir Rana, head of the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, a think tank focused on counterterrorism and security. \u201cThey have become ideologically more radical and have turned to more brutal attacks.\u201dOne consequence of Islamic State\u2019s losses in the Middle East may be a rekindled debate within the organization\u2019s affiliates about just how indiscriminately brutal they should be. That issue has already split Boko Haram, currently known as Islamic State West Africa Province, with one faction treating anyone not actively aiding the group as apostates deserving death and another preaching more targeted violence against Christians and government officials.In Pakistan, a recently formed group made up of disaffected Islamic State fighters, Ansar ul-Sharia Pakistan, has similarly rejected mass attacks targeting ordinary Muslims, focusing on assassinating police officers instead.In trying to assess Islamic State\u2019s global future after Mosul, terrorism experts and counterterrorism officials look for clues in what happened to al Qaeda after the loss of its Afghan base in 2001 and the killing of Osama bin Laden\u00a010 years later. While these events significantly weakened al Qaeda\u2019s core and reduced its ability to target the West, the group\u2019s regional affiliates have flourished nevertheless\u2014and marched on to victories in places such as northern Mali, Somalia and Yemen.Niger parliament member Lamido Moumouni Harouna, who represents a region on the border with Nigeria that is frequently attacked by Boko Haram, said that he doesn\u2019t expect his constituents to benefit from Islamic State\u2019s demise in Mosul and Raqqa. \u201cThe conflict here is a local conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the way it will develop will depend on how the local environment develops.\u201dWrite to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'After Mosul, Faraway ISIS \u2018Provinces\u2019 Fight On.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beyond-syria-and-iraq-faraway-isis-provinces-fight-on-1500543000", "keywords": [" boko haram, isil, isis,islamic state, marawi, mosul, nigeria, philippines, raqqa,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 05:30:00", "news_title": "How Quants Calm the Stock Market ", "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s quiet out there. Too quiet.\u201dThe number of times that this movie clich\u00e9 turned trading clich\u00e9 has appeared in market commentaries recently is a testament to how dull trading has been and how nervous investors are about it.Stock-market volatility was so low in the first few months of the year that some analysts said bad times were coming soon. Then the market got calmer. Over half of the 25 lowest readings ever in the VIX, the             CBOE                   Volatility Index that is widely cited as a proxy for investor caution, have occurred since May. Earlier this month the VIX hit its lowest-ever 30-day moving average.The main explanation why options prices, upon which the VIX is based, are showing little concern about volatility in the future is that actual, realized volatility of stocks also has been so low. The most commonly cited factors are that central banks will save the day in the case of bad news and that there have been few recent economic surprises.Neither will last forever, but there may be a less-noticed factor dampening volatility with more staying power: quant trading.\u00a0The share of trading done by funds run by algorithms has doubled in just four years to over a quarter of U.S. stock turnover, according to Tabb Group. Their success is partly a result of vast new flows of information from satellites, credit-card transactions, social media and other sources being interpreted by an army of PhDs with massive computing power.\u201cIf there are fewer things that lead to surprises because information is going from completely unknown to completely known\u2026then you should have less volatility,\u201d says Leigh Drogen, a former quant trader and chief executive officer of crowd-sourced earnings-estimate provider Estimize.Investors sell when they hear bad news about a company, but if they get that news from multiple sources over time, the selling should be spread out. In the past, everyone learned of the downturn when the company announced earnings, making the selloff rapid and the stock more volatile. While hard to quantify, the VIX, now below 10, may well be two or more points lower thanks to better information.But could this happy state of affairs contain the seeds of a major comeuppance? Despite more information, business cycles or geopolitical risks haven\u2019t gone extinct. Traders grappling with a low-return world where passive funds rule have crowded into similar strategies and bet on the same statistical anomalies, often using leverage.Mr. Drogen doesn\u2019t think such statistical arbitrage investors will bolt in a market shock, but he admits that high-frequency traders might. Since they provide so much liquidity, and since computerized trades won\u2019t be placed if liquidity dries up, a quant exodus could happen.The so-called quant quake in August 2007 saw some funds lose nearly a third of their value in a week and many odd stock market moves, but no systemic shock. With traditional stock pickers and bank trading desks playing a much smaller role than a decade ago and quant funds being far larger, the notion that we are experiencing the calm before a fairly nasty storm may be more than just a bad screenplay.Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-quants-calm-the-stock-market-1500543001", "keywords": ["quant funds,quant trading,vix ,vix quants,commodity,financial market news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 05:17:00", "news_title": "The Saga Isn\u2019t Over for Dalian Wanda", "content": "Many good movies have a satisfying twist at the end. China\u2019s Dalian Wanda Group\u2014owner of the world\u2019s biggest cinema chain,             AMC Entertainment        AMC 0.96%      \u2014may hope a last-minute tweak to a deal to sell nearly $10 billion of hotel and amusement park assets can solve some its near-term problems. Yet its key audience, the powers that be in Beijing, may still not be applauding.Under scrutiny from regulators following its debt-fueled shopping spree overseas in recent years, Wanda had originally planned to sell a collection of its Chinese assets to             Sunac China,        1918 9.65%       a fellow property developer. Sunac itself, though, is also heavily in debt, to the extent that Wanda had arranged to lend it some $4.4 billion to get the deal done.The arrival of a new buyer, midsize developer             Guangzhou R&F Properties,        2777 4.37%       means Wanda can sell it some of the hotels in the deal for $2.95 billion. That leaves Sunac needing to fund a smaller bill of $6.5 billion to buy only the theme parks. As a result, Wanda\u2019s loan to Sunac has been canceled.Happy endings for all, it might seem. Sunac\u2019s shares jumped 16% Thursday, while R&F\u2019s rose 10%. Wanda says the deal will lead to a \u201csignificant\u201d reduction in its debt burden: The price of its bonds surged Thursday.But investors should wait for the credits to roll. Sunac will still be highly indebted after this deal, which, even at its reduced size, will eat up most of its cash. The yield on its bonds is still well up from their level a month ago, meaning it faces much higher financing costs in future.As for Wanda, its objective of gaining a listing in mainland China by August next year may remain tough to achieve. The company delisted its commercial unit from the Hong Kong exchange last year in a $4.4 billion take-private deal. It promised that deal\u2019s investors a higher valuation from a mainland listing, adding that it would repay them with 12% interest a year if that didn\u2019t materialize.There is, however, still a logjam of companies trying to list in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

The move, which will take effect in November, is part of the exchange operator\u2019s efforts to boost interest and trading volume in its market. The exchange scrapped its longstanding lunch break in March 2011.While going out for lunch is a dying tradition in the U.S. during the working week, the meal is still sacrosanct in many countries across Asia, not just for eating but also for networking. In 2012, hundreds of brokers in Hong Kong protested when the Hong Kong stock exchange cut its onetime two-hour midday trading break down to the current 60 minutes.\u2018 Lunch is a way to network.\u2019Stock exchanges in mainland China, Malaysia and Tokyo also have midday lunch intermissions. The Indonesia Stock Exchange has a 90-minute break each day, an intermission that swells to 2\u00bd hours on Fridays.Still, continuous trading occurs on exchanges in India, South Korea and Australia. And no major Western stock exchange has a midday break. In the U.S., the New York Stock Exchange gave up its lunch intermission in 1871.Singapore had originally scrapped the lunch hour to increase competitiveness with its Asian-Pacific peers, but critics said trading volume dried up during what were normal lunch hours anyway. The exchange has also announced plans to increase the minimum bid sizes for some listed securities and other measures to boost trading volume.Many appear to feel a proper lunch break will help concentrate traders\u2019 minds.\u201cThere was agreement with SGX\u2019s view that a midday break will not adversely affect trading volumes in any significant way,\u201d SGX said, following a consultation with some 40 firms involved in the market. \u201cSome respondents also said that shorter trading hours may in fact result in higher trading velocity and a concentration of liquidity which would make price discovery easier.\u201dNicholas Teo,        a trading strategist at KGI Securities in Singapore said: \u201dLunch is always good. We\u2019re in a relationship-building business. Lunch is a way to network.\u201dFrom a corporate perspective, Mr. Teo said that a lunch break might also give companies the opportunity to release news in the middle of the day without concern of a halt in trading of their stock.Singapore has long been an important financial center in Asia, and has become a hub for high-tech data centers in recent years. Still, its equity market is relatively small, with roughly a $730 billion market capitalization as of May, according to the World Federation of Exchanges. That is much smaller than rival exchanges in Asia such as those in Tokyo and Hong Kong, and a fraction of major markets in the U.S., data from the federation showed.Singapore\u2019s market has performed well so far in 2017. The Straits Times index is up 15% year to date, riding a wave that has lifted most global equity markets higher for the year.The Singapore Exchange\u2019s reputation has taken a hit over the past several years. A crash of three small-capitalization stocks listed there in 2013 wiped out billions in market value, spooking investors and leading to diminished trading volumes in the region. The exchange has also grappled with a spate of high-profile trading outages in recent years. It hosted just 16 initial public offerings last year, down from 27 in 2014 and as many as 79 in 2004, according to data provider Dealogic.The announced changes are set to go into effect on Nov. 13.Write to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/traders-rejoice-lunch-break-is-returning-to-singapores-stock-market-1500540680", "keywords": [" sgx continuous trading,sgx lunch, sgx lunch break,sgx trading hours,singapore equities,singapore stock exchange lunch break, singapore stock exchange trading hours,singapore stock market,Singapore Exchange,S68.SG,SG:S68,Nicholas Teo,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,financial investments,securities,commodity exchange activities,financial services,investing"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 04:47:00", "news_title": "Volvo Accelerates Toward Electric Future With China\u2019s Geely", "content": "STOCKHOLM\u2014Volvo Car Corp. and its Chinese parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. on Thursday outlined a wide-ranging technical collaboration to further the Swedish auto maker\u2019s transformation into an all-electric brand and as well Geely\u2019s global ambitions.Under their agreement, they will create a China-based joint venture to build on their current technology sharing with the aim of accelerating electric-car development.Volvo Cars will also take a \u201csignificant minority stake\u201d in             Lynk        GELYY -2.36%       & Co., a car brand the Chinese investment group created in its effort to become a global automotive force.

The iconic car maker, long known in suburban America for its safety and reliability, is trying to leverage its brand recognition to become a force in new technology such as electric cars, connected vehicles and self-driving cars.Volvo on Thursday said its second-quarter net profit rose to 1.56 billion Swedish kronor ($187.8 million) from 1.27 billion kronor last year, with operating profit rising 34% to 3.29 billion kronor.New car sales in the period rose 9.2% to 148,493 units, riding strong results in China. Revenue rose to 54.47 billion kronor from a year-earlier 42.18 billion kronor, driven by demand for the company\u2019s XC60, S90 and V90 models and favorable exchange rates.Volvo and Geely already share some technology, including a system that allows Volvo, Geely and Lynk models to share components. Mr. Samuelsson said the new joint venture aims to greatly expand the collaboration.The venture aims to lower development costs by sharing technology across the three car companies controlled by Geely Holding as Volvo prepares to launch three new electric vehicles by 2025 and Lynk sets out to expand its offering after the launch this year of its Model 01 sport-utility vehicle.The collaboration will also expand to include the development of battery cells, electric motors and charging systems with components shared across Geely Holding\u2019s three auto brands.Write to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com and Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/volvo-accelerates-toward-electric-future-with-chinas-geely-1500540467", "keywords": [" electric cars, electric motors, geely, hyrbrid, joint venture,volv,Geely Automobile Holdings,0175.HK,Volvo Car,Zhejiang Geely Holdings,Zhejiang Geely Holding Group,corporate changes,financial performance,earnings,ownership changes,joint ventures,consortia,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,headquarters relocation,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 03:45:00", "news_title": "Unilever Reassures Investors With Strong Earnings", "content": "LONDON\u2014            Unilever        UL 0.76%       PLC on Thursday reported a sharp rise in first-half profit and forecast better-than-expected margins for the full year, making good for now on its promise to improve its performance after fending off a $143 billion takeover approach from Kraft Heinz Co. earlier this year.The upbeat earnings report will reassure investors as the industry grapples with fast-changing consumer tastes and slowing sales.

Analysts had \u00a0projected a \u00a00.5% decline.The Paris-based company is trying to turn things around after a difficult 2016 in which its financial performance lagged rivals.

It is too early to tell whether the ad market in the U.S. is turning a corner after a weak first quarter that set the scene for a potentially tough year, he added.Mr. Sadoun was installed last month as only the third chief executive to lead the storied ad conglomerate at a time when the advertising world has been wrestling with the seismic shift from traditional platforms, such as print and TV, to digital.Recently, Publicis and its rivals have contended with major slowdowns in industries that they have long relied upon for growth.Mr. Sadoun has already ruffled feathers by announcing Publicis would take a break from creative awards\u2014seen by employees as an important validation of their craft and achievements\u2014and channel the savings to build an artificial intelligence platform.Publicis said net profit rose 1.6% in the first half to \u20ac387 million.

Analysts at the time estimated that it could be worth $2.5 billion to $4 billion.The agreement also comes amid a flurry of planned sales or strategic reviews of well-known packaged food brands across an industry looking to cut costs and insulate itself from slowing sales. Many companies are trying to change their product mixes as consumers move to healthier or locally produced options. Low inflation has made it difficult to raise prices to make up for sluggish volume growth in many markets.That has triggered a number of strategic reviews among big food firms. Unilever PLC, the Anglo-Dutch consumer-goods behemoth that earlier this year rejectedKraft Heinz Co.\u2019s       $143 billion takeover bid, has said it is planning to unload its margarine-and-spreads business.

Post faced several other bidders for the brand, which China\u2019s Bright Food Group Co. and Baring Private Equity Asia had put on the block.Bright bought its 60% stake in Weetabix in 2012 for \u00a31.2 billion but never succeeded in turning it into a hit in Asia. Still, the price Bright ultimately got from Post translated into a higher multiple over adjusted earnings than some had expected.Reckitt\u2019s food business, called RB Foods, was seen as one of the most attractive on the block in recent months. French\u2019s is America\u2019s best-selling yellow mustard. RB Foods other brands include Frank\u2019s RedHot sauce and Cattlemen\u2019s barbecue sauce.Reckitt said it wasn\u2019t core, as it puts more emphasis on its home and personal-care offerings. In February, Reckitt agreed to acquire baby-food maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.RB Foods generated just \u00a3411 million ($536 million) of Reckitt\u2019s overall revenue of \u00a39.89 billion in 2016. But its operating margins\u2014considered close to 27% last year\u2014are considered high for packaged food.Sparks, Md.-based McCormick, whose current brands include Lawry\u2019s and Grill Mates, said it expects combined 2017 annual net sales of about $5 billion. It also projects the deal will generate cost savings of around $50 million, the majority of which will be achieved by 2020.Though McCormick\u2019s leverage ratio will increase because of the deal, the company plans to maintain its dividend policy but curtail its share-buyback program in an effort to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, it said.

Nintendo had trouble ramping up manufacturing of the console and as a result, Switch production during the quarter was lower than what the Kyoto-based company had planned.OUTLOOK REVISION: Media reports of hundreds of people lining up to buy a Switch console suggest demand remains strong. Analysts think Nintendo\u2019s Switch sales forecast of 10 million units by the end of March next year is too conservative, and expect Nintendo to slowly raise that target every quarter, but avoid setting a very ambitious goal.NO BRIEFING: Nintendo\u2019s earnings briefings for media and analysts have often been an opportunity for the company to unveil what\u2019s coming up next, but by custom the company doesn\u2019t hold one for the first quarter, which a Nintendo spokesman confirmed would be the case this time as well.

Investors will watch closely for hints as to the bank\u2019s moves after December, when QE is currently due to end. The details of the ECB\u2019s exit strategy matter hugely for asset prices, interest rates and the euro currency.Here are key questions ahead of the central bank\u2019s policy release, due at 1145 GMT (7:45 a.m. EDT).Taper tips. According to Mr. Draghi, ECB officials haven\u2019t yet discussed winding down, or tapering, their bond purchases. If a first discussion took place this week, that would be a strong signal that an announcement on tapering QE is imminent\u2014perhaps after the ECB\u2019s next policy meeting on Sept. 7. Concrete details will probably have to wait, however. Mr. Draghi is also likely to soothe markets by emphasizing that any policy change will be gradual.It is in its best shape since before the financial crisis. After outpacing the U.S. in the first quarter, the bloc\u2019s economy might have grown by 3% on an annualized basis in the three months to June\u2014the fastest pace in around a decade. Unemployment is falling, and consumer and business sentiment indicators are at multiyear highs.Because the indicator that the ECB actually targets\u2014inflation\u2014is still too weak. Policy makers don\u2019t fully understand why strong growth has yet to feed through to consumer prices, which rose only 1.3% on the year last month. But in a crucial shift, Mr. Draghi has suggested that ECB officials may be willing to overlook that weakness because they are confident that inflation will pick up over time.Mr. Draghi might announce an internal review into different exit strategies. The most obvious plan would be to reduce QE by \u20ac10 billion a month from January, following the example of the Federal Reserve, but many analysts expect staggered \u20ac20 billion reductions at three-month intervals. The ECB chief might also clarify how soon interest rates will rise after the end of QE. And the ECB might drop its pledge to accelerate QE if the economic outlook darkens, though that is unclear.A lot. Officials are wary of repeating the Fed\u2019s policy error four years ago, when it triggered a \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d in financial markets by signaling the end of its own QE program. A surge in interest rates and the value of the euro could stop the region\u2019s long-awaited recovery in its tracks. That is why Mr. Draghi is expected to stress the need for patience and prudence.Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-brace-for-clues-on-ecb-tapering-1500523201", "keywords": [" asset purchases, draghi,ecb, ecb qe, ecb stimulus, european central bank, mario draghi, qe,European Central Bank,Mario Draghi,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"]}]
