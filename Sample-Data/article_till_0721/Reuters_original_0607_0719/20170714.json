Singapore's GDP expanded 0.4 percent in the April-June period from the previous quarter on an annualised and seasonally adjusted basis, but was lower than a median forecast of 1.1 percent in a Reuters poll.     The economic growth clocked an average pace of 2.5 percent in the first half of 2017, putting the city-state on track for an annual growth in the range of 2 percent to 3 percent, which is within official parameters, OCBC Bank said in a note.     Singapore shares rose as much as 0.6 percent, posting gains across sectors. Singapore Telecommunications was the biggest boost on the index, rising as much as 1 percent, while Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp climbed 0.5 percent.      Other stock markets in the region fell, with the Philippines  dropping as much as 0.6 percent. Real estate stocks Ayala Land and SM Prime Holdings fell 1.4 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.     Indonesian shares slipped 0.3 percent, dragged by financials and consumer stocks. Unilever Indonesia fell as much as 1.7 percent, while Bank Rakyat Indonesia  dropped nearly 1.9 percent.     Thai shares fell as much as 0.2 percent, after two sessions of gains, with real estate developer Central Pattana  posting a 2.2 percent drop to hit its lowest in more than two weeks.      Oil and gas refiner PTT Pcl was the biggest drag on the index, falling 0.5 percent.     Vietnam was marginally lower, pulled under by Vinamilk and property developer Vingroup JSC.      Malaysian shares were largely flat as losses in telecom stocks Axiata Group and DiGi.Com outweighed a 2.3 percent gain in Genting Bhd.

On the third stop of four-day, four-city barnstorming blitz to promote their Aug. 26 Las Vegas clash, the witty barbs that characterized their exchanges Los Angeles and Toronto were replaced by what appeared to be real venom. Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) champion McGregor traded in the stylish suits he wore on the previous two legs of the tour for psychedelic pants and a furry white coat worn over a bare, tattooed chest. He strutted imperiously onto the Barclays Center stage to an Irish ballad and thunderous applause before flexing his muscles, striking poses and rattling off a dance step or two as he waited for the undefeated boxer. It looked for a moment as if the circus was going to take a turn for the worse when McGregor, who addressed the 40-year-old Mayweather as  boy  in Toronto, let a howling crowd know he did not take the charges of racism seriously.  A lot of media have said I am against black people, that's absolutely ... ridiculous,  McGregor roared. The Irishman, who at times during the earlier stops had appeared to get under Mayweather's skin, had no such luck in Brooklyn, where the American ignored the jibes and took selfies while McGregor barked in his ear. McGregor is expected to be the aggressor in the ring against the former five-division world champion to make up for his lack of boxing experience and has played that role throughout the tour, which wraps up on Friday with a stop in London. Famous for his knockout power in the MMA cage, McGregor  managed only glancing blows on Thursday as Mayweather, widely regarded as one of the best defensive fighters of all-time, side-stepped and returned fired by dubbing McGregor a quitter.

Murray-USA TODAY Sports (He) didn't quit once, (he) didn't quit twice, (he) quit three time,  Mayweather screamed with another volley of profanity, referring to McGregor tapping out in his three career defeats.  While boxing purists have denounced the fight as nothing more than a laughable cashgrab it has nonetheless captured the fascination of many fight fans. McGregor has been the undisputed favorite at each stop on the media tour, and can expect more of the same in London, but few give him any chance in the ring against one of the most skilled and tactically astute boxers of all time. Jul 13, 2017; Brooklyn, NY, USA;  Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor during a world tour press conference to promote the upcoming Mayweather vs McGregor boxing fight at Barclays Center. Mandatory Credit: Noah K. Murray-USA TODAY SportsThe fight would seem an outlandish mismatch with Mayweather 49-0 stepping into the ring against McGregor, who will be making his professional boxing debut. The underdog role is one that fits McGregor like one of his tailored suits, however, and he recalled similar predictions before he beat Jose Aldo to win the UFC featherweight title in late 2015.  They said the same things then as they're saying now,  he said.  They said I had no chance. They said I’m in over my head. They said he kicks too hard. Too many weapons.   The Irishman is going to fall short, he doesn’t stand a hope.   It took me 13 seconds.  Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto.

Liu Xiaobo, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. Liu Xia has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 and was allowed to visit him in prison about once a month. She suffers from depression. Liu Xiaobo died on Thursday after suffering multiple organ failure. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. Rights groups and Western governments have mourned Liu Xiaobo's death and also called for Chinese authorities to allow his wife and the rest of his family to move around freely. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein also urged China to guarantee Liu Xia freedom of movement, and allow her to travel abroad should she want to. China, however, said the case remained an internal matter.  The handling of Liu Xiaobo's case belongs to China's domestic affairs, and foreign countries are in no position to make improper remarks,  China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement sent to Reuters on Friday.  We call on relevant countries to respect China's judicial sovereignty and not to meddle in China's domestic affairs with this individual case,  he said. Hu Jia, a fellow dissident and family friend, said Liu Xia's freedom was now a top priority for Liu Xiaobo's supporters.  Now, we are most concerned about Liu Xia, but there has been no information about her. She is at this moment the person who is suffering most,  Hu said.  All the willpower and force we put behind freeing Liu Xiaobo, we have turned to Liu Xia,  he said, calling on the United States and Germany to continue pressuring China to free Liu Xia. Efforts should also focus on Liu Hui, the younger brother of Liu Xia, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2013 for fraud and to whom Liu Xia is very close, Hu said. Several other family friends also confirmed that they were still unable to contact Liu Xia or other members of Liu's family to confirm her whereabouts. Shanghai-based writer Wen Kejian, another friend of the Liu family, said his supporters would  pay very close attention to Liu Xia's freedom .  I think, no matter what, she should be granted complete and unconditional freedom,  Wen said.

His comments came after Japan and the European Union signed a free-trade pact that has displeased some parts of Japan's agriculture sector.  Aso told reporters it was too early to offer details on the size of any additional spending on the farm sector or how it would be funded. But the minister said he wasn't interested in simply handing out subsidies to farmers who are too weak to compete with an expected increase in dairy and lumber imports from the EU once the trade pact takes effect. Aso's comments show the government is likely to turn a deaf ear to any requests for a huge spending increase, and suggest Japan will put more emphasis on improving logistics in the  agriculture sector.   I don't want backward-looking policies based on the assumption that we will lose out to increased competition,  he  said.  I want forward-looking polices that will help us win at the export game.  Japan and the EU agreed early this month to create the world's biggest open economic area and signal resistance to what both sides characterized as a shift to protectionism by U.S. President Donald Trump. Under the pact, Japan will phase out tariffs as high as 29 percent on European hard cheese over 15 years. In return, the EU will eliminate tariffs of up to 10 percent on Japanese cars over seven years. Some in Japan's agriculture sector argue that their high costs for fresh milk put them at a disadvantage relative to European cheese makers.

BlackRock said it supported the shareholder motions to press companies to develop or disclose policies geared to promote gender diversity. It did not name the companies it pushed but said the  majority  had boards of directors lacking women.  We've been particularly focused on increasing the number of women on U.S. boards because progress in the U.S. has been slower than in many other markets,  BlackRock said in a report it distributed.  Board diversity, particularly in terms of gender, is important from a sustainable investment perspective, given that diverse groups have been demonstrated to make better decisions,  it added.  This appears to be because they are better able to consider, where appropriate, alternatives to current strategies - a proposition that can ultimately lead to sustained value creation.  Women hold about a fifth of board seats in the S&P; 500 .SPX index, according to Catalyst Inc, an advocacy group. BlackRock said it also voted against board members at five companies who sat on nominating committees but failed to respond to investors' concerns about diversity. It was the first year the company  decided to vote against members of the nomination committee of men-only boards in a more systematic manner,  a spokesman said, although it had engaged on the topic of gender diversity for  many years.   The New York-based company manages more than $5.4 trillion in assets, many in index funds that buy broad swaths of the market, making it a top shareholder in most public companies. It has been pressured by activists and investors to back shareholder-fronted propositions and vote against obstinate boards to prompt better corporate citizenship. Chief Executive Larry Fink has encouraged executives to adjust their behavior to focus on generating long-term value for shareholders, rather than meeting short-term earnings targets. Breaking with prior practice, BlackRock this year publicly disclosed opposition to practices at oil company Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), drugmaker Mylan NV (MYL.O) and other firms over climate change, compensation and other policies.

The Nikkei index was up 0.2 percent at 20,144.82 at the end of morning trade. It was up 1.1 percent for the week. Markets in Japan will be closed for a holiday on Monday and will resume trading on Tuesday. Major U.S. indexes marked modest gains overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging up to a record close, as investors warily awaited earnings and U.S. inflation data. The U.S. quarterly earnings season revs up on Friday with big U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all reporting results. The U.S. core consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to have risen only 1.7 percent year-on-year in June after a similar gain in May. On a month-on-month basis, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent increase the previous month.  The U.S. CPI figures will come out later, so the market is waiting for this,  said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  Ahead of a three-day weekend in Japan, investors have no incentive to extend their positions,  he said. Weighing on sentiment, market giant Fast Retailing Co saw its shares skid 4.5 percent after the owner of clothing chain Uniqlo reported a quarterly operating profit of 49.9 billion yen ($440.07 million) for the three months through May. That fell short of a 52.85 billion yen Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate based on estimates of six analysts. Shares of industrial materials maker JSR Corp rose 3.1 percent. The company's operating profit is estimated to have surged to 10 billion yen in the April-June quarter from 5.6 billion yen a year earlier, business daily Nikkei reported.

The U.S. currency's recent advance, notably against the yen, has stalled towards the end of this week as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen curbed some of the monetary tightening expectations that had supported the greenback. Signs of a pickup in U.S. inflation could reinforce views that the Fed would hike interest rates again sooner rather than later, which would lift Treasury yields and the dollar. However, the core consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to have risen only 1.7 percent year-on-year in June after a similar gain in May. On a month-on-month basis, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent gain the previous month.  After their June rate hike, the Fed is seen watching inflation trends carefully before tightening policy again. So market interest towards inflation data is very high and the dollar is likely to move widely in either direction,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was flat at 95.740, poised to end the week 0.25 percent lower. The greenback inched up 0.1 percent to 113.415 yen but still some distance away from a four-month peak of 114.495 struck on Tuesday. Other currencies also advanced against the yen. The euro rose 0.2 percent to 129.400 yen, sterling also added 0.2 percent, to 146.90 yen and the Australian dollar climbed 0.3 percent to 87.89 yen, its highest since mid-February.  Central banks around the world are poised to move from an emergency mode to a more normal stance, with the exception of Japan,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior forex strategist at Daiwa Securities.  The yen clearly stands out as a result and its weakness is likely to persist.  The euro was little changed at $1.1407, unable to draw much lift even as Germany's 10-year bund yield climbed back above the 0.50 percent threshold overnight on a report that the European Central Bank is likely to signal in September that its asset purchase programme will be gradually wound down next year.  The euro has become top heavy over the past few days with participants unwinding some of the bloated long positions built up recently. But the euro is still likely to begin probing highs again on speculation that the ECB would begin normalising policy,  Yamamoto at Mizuho Securities said. The common currency had set a 14-month high of $1.1489 on Wednesday on views that the ECB would begin reversing its very easy monetary policy sooner rather than later. The Australian dollar touched a four-month peak of $0.7746 . The Aussie was on track to rise 1.7 percent on the week, lifted by an improvement in broader investor risk appetite thanks to hopes for a more gradual tightening schedule by the Fed and rise in prices of commodities, notably iron ore. The New Zealand dollar, another relatively high-yielding currency that has benefited from stronger risk appetite this week, traded at $0.7320 after climbing to an eight-month peak of $0.7369 on Thursday.

They were waiting for credentials to enter the World Health Organization's global tobacco treaty conference, one designed to curb smoking and combat the influence of the cigarette industry. Treaty officials didn't want them there. But still, among those lined up hoping to get in were executives from Japan Tobacco International and British American Tobacco Plc. There was a big name missing from the group: Philip Morris International Inc. A Philip Morris representative later told Reuters its employees didn't turn up because the company knew it wasn't welcome. In fact, executives from the largest publicly traded tobacco firm had flown in from around the world to New Delhi for the anti-tobacco meeting. Unknown to treaty organizers, they were staying at a hotel an hour from the convention center, working from an operations room there. Philip Morris International would soon be holding secret meetings with delegates from the government of Vietnam and other treaty members. The object of these clandestine activities: the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking globally. Reuters has found that Philip Morris International is running a secretive campaign to block or weaken treaty provisions that save millions of lives by curbing tobacco use. In an internal document, the company says it supported the enactment of the treaty. But Philip Morris has come to view it as a  regulatory runaway train  driven by  anti-tobacco extremists  – a description contained in the document, a 2014 PowerPoint presentation. Confidential company documents and interviews with current and former Philip Morris employees reveal an offensive that stretches from the Americas to Africa to Asia, from hardscrabble tobacco fields to the halls of political power, in what may be one of the broadest corporate lobbying efforts in existence. Details of those plans are laid bare in a cache of Philip Morris documents reviewed by Reuters, one of the largest tobacco industry leaks ever. Reuters is publishing a selection of those papers in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) Dating from 2009 to 2016, the thousands of pages include emails between executives, PowerPoint presentations, planning papers, policy toolkits, national lobbying plans and market analyses. Taken as a whole, they present a company that has focused its vast global resources on bringing to heel the world's tobacco control treaty. Targeting the Treaty Philip Morris works to subvert the treaty on multiple levels. It targets the FCTC conferences where delegates gather to decide on anti-smoking guidelines. It also lobbies at the country level, where the makeup of FCTC delegations is determined and treaty decisions are turned into legislation. The documents, combined with reporting in 14 countries from Brazil to Uganda to Vietnam, reveal that a goal of Philip Morris is to increase the number of delegates at the treaty conventions who are not from health ministries or involved in public health. That's happening: A Reuters analysis of delegates to the FCTC's biennial conference shows a rise since the first convention in 2006 in the number of officials from ministries like trade, finance and agriculture for whom tobacco revenues can be a higher priority than health concerns. Philip Morris International says there is nothing improper about its executives engaging with government officials.  As a company in a highly regulated industry, speaking with governments is part of our everyday business,  Tony Snyder, vice president of communications, said in a statement in response to Reuters' findings.  The fact that Reuters has seen internal emails discussing our engagement with governments does not make those interactions inappropriate.  In a series of interviews in Europe and Asia, Philip Morris executive Andrew Cave said company employees are under strict instructions to obey both the company's own conduct policies and local law in the countries where they operate. Cave, a director of corporate affairs, said that while Philip Morris disagrees with some aspects of the FCTC treaty and consults with delegates offsite during its conferences, ultimately the delegations  make their own decisions.   We're respectful of the fact that this is their week and their event,  said Cave in an interview in New Delhi, as the parties to the treaty met last November. Asked in an earlier interview whether Philip Morris conducts a formal campaign targeting the treaty's biennial conferences, Cave gave a flat  no.  Health Impact When the FCTC delegates gather, lives hang in the balance. Decisions taken at the conferences over the past decade, including a ban on smoking in public places, are saving millions of lives, according to researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center. Between 2007 and 2014, more than 53 million people in 88 countries stopped smoking because those nations imposed stringent anti-smoking measures recommended by the WHO, according to their December 2016 study. Because of the treaty, an estimated 22 million smoking-related deaths will be averted, the researchers found. According to the WHO, though, tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death – and by 2030 will be responsible for eight million deaths a year, up from six million now. There was jubilation among anti-smoking advocates when the treaty was adopted in 2003. The treaty, which took effect in 2005, made it possible to push for measures that once seemed radical, such as smoke-free bars. About 90 percent of all nations eventually joined. A big holdout is the United States, which signed the treaty but has yet to ratify it. Since the FCTC came into force, it has persuaded dozens of nations to boost taxes on tobacco products, pass laws banning smoking in public places and increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. Treaty members gather every two years to consider new provisions or strengthen old ones at a meeting called the Conference of the Parties, or COP, which first convened in 2006 in Geneva. But an FCTC report shows that implementation of important sections of the treaty is stalling. There has been no further progress in the implementation of 7 out of 16  substantive  treaty articles since 2014, according to a report by the FCTC Secretariat in June last year. A key reason:  The tobacco industry continues to be the most important barrier in implementation of the Convention.  'More Powerful Than Ever' Indeed, the tobacco industry has weathered the tighter regulation. There has been only a slight 1.9 percent decline in global cigarette sales since the treaty took effect in 2005, and more people smoked daily in 2015 than a decade earlier, studies show. The Thomson Reuters Global Tobacco Index, which tracks tobacco stocks, has risen more than 100 percent in the past decade, largely due to price increases.  Some people think that with tobacco, you've won the battle,  said former Finnish Health Minister Pekka Puska, who chaired an FCTC committee last year.  No way,  he said.  The tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.  With 600 corporate affairs executives, according to a November 2015 internal email, Philip Morris has one of the world's biggest corporate lobbying arms. That army, and $7 billion-plus in annual net profit, gives Philip Morris the resources to overwhelm the FCTC. The treaty is overseen by 19 staff at a Secretariat office hosted by the WHO in Geneva. The Secretariat spends on average less than $6 million a year. Even when buttressed by anti-smoking groups, the Secretariat is outgunned. Its budget for this year and last year for supporting the treaty clause on combating tobacco company influence is less than $460,000. Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the FCTC treaty Secretariat, is the person tasked with preventing the industry from neutering the agreement. In two interviews at her Geneva office, da Costa e Silva, a medical doctor who holds a PhD in public health and has a dyed pink streak in her hair, explained why the FCTC banned attendance by any member of the public at the 2014 biennial conference in Moscow. The ban came in response to efforts by tobacco executives to use public badges to get inside the venue, she said, adding that industry representatives then started borrowing badges from delegates they knew to gain entry.  It's a real war,  said da Costa e Silva. But she had only a partial picture of the forces ranged against her. She wasn't aware of the fact that Philip Morris had a large team operating throughout the convention in Moscow, or the details of its activities in New Delhi last November.  This is so disgusting. These are the forces against which we have to work,  da Costa e Silva said in May after being told about the Philip Morris documents.  I think they want to implode the treaty.  Tobacco Outrage The idea of a global tobacco treaty had been discussed among health advocates since at least 1979, when a WHO committee suggested the possibility. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway who became director-general of the WHO in 1998, made it happen. She was aided by outrage over documents that surfaced as part of the landmark 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, in which the four largest U.S. tobacco companies agreed to pay more than $200 billion to 46 U.S. states. The internal communications showed that tobacco executives lied for years about their knowledge of the deadly nature of cigarettes. A 1989 document revealed one company's plan to fight threats to the industry.  WHO's impact and influence is indisputable,  the document said. It went on to contemplate  countermeasures designed to contain/neutralize/re-orient the WHO.  That company was Philip Morris. In 2008, Altria Group Inc split up its Philip Morris business. Philip Morris USA, which remains a subsidiary of Altria, sells Marlboro and other brands in the United States. Philip Morris International was spun off, and handles business abroad. Since the split, Philip Morris International shares have more than doubled and Altria's have more than tripled. Philip Morris International's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, down the street from a patch of Gallo-Roman ruins, in a sleek building with a cafeteria, gym and a patio facing Lake Geneva. From there, the company is working to hobble the treaty. Internal company communications reveal the scope of Philip Morris' operation during the 2014 FCTC treaty meeting in Moscow. The company set up a  Coordinating Room  that could seat 42 people, according to the 2014 PowerPoint presentation, titled  Corporate affairs approach and issues.  Leading the operation was executive Chris Koddermann. Formerly a lawyer and lobbyist in Canada, Koddermann joined Philip Morris in 2010. He is now a director of regulatory affairs in Lausanne. The PowerPoint describes the ideal corporate affairs executive as someone who is able to  play the political game.  Koddermann previously worked for federal and provincial cabinet ministers in Canada, according to his LinkedIn profile. Reached on his cell phone in March, Koddermann said he wouldn't be able to meet and that any questions should be directed to Philip Morris International. Congratulatory Email At the end of the Moscow meeting, on Oct. 18, 2014, Koddermann sent an email congratulating a 33-person Philip Morris team on their success in diluting or blocking measures intended to strengthen tobacco controls and reduce cigarette sales. The gains he touted at the end of the week-long conference were the culmination of a two-year effort, his email said. The documents shed light on one key objective in Philip Morris' FCTC campaign: Keep tobacco within the ambit of international trade deals, so that the company has a way to mount legal campaigns against tobacco regulations. In Moscow, one proposal initially called for carving out tobacco from trade pacts. International trade treaties often include provisions, such as the protection of trademarks, that Philip Morris has used to challenge anti-smoking measures. If tobacco were taken out of the treaties, as suggested by the proposal, Philip Morris could be deprived of many such legal arguments. An early draft asked parties to support efforts to exclude tobacco from trade pacts and to prevent the industry from  abusing  trade and investment rules. In the end, the proposal was watered down. The final decision only reminded parties of  the possibility to take into account their public health objectives in their negotiation of trade and investment agreements.  There was no mention of excluding tobacco. Koddermann, in his email to colleagues on the last day of the conference, declared victory, describing the change as  a tremendous outcome.  Overall, the company achieved its  trade related campaign objectives,  including  avoiding a declaration of health over trade  and  avoiding the recognition of the FCTC as an international standard,  he wrote. The win was significant. A former Philip Morris employee said the company has routinely used trade treaties to challenge tobacco control laws. The aim, he said, was  to scare governments away from doing regulatory changes.  Even though the tobacco industry has lost a series of major legal battles, its suits have served to discourage the implementation of regulations that curb smoking. Those delays can yield years of unimpeded sales. As the Philip Morris PowerPoint presentation from 2014 put it:  Roadblocks are as important as solutions.  'Watered Down' One roadblock was a campaign to stop the 2011 introduction of rules in Australia banning logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The company's litigation and arbitration against the measure ultimately were dismissed – but not before five countries filed complaints against Australia on the same subject at the World Trade Organization. The global trade body has yet to announce a decision in the matter. The attempt to undo Australia's regulations has had a chilling effect elsewhere. It slowed the introduction of plain-packaging rules in New Zealand. Citing the risk that tobacco companies may  mount legal challenges,  the government announced in 2013 that it was postponing the move and waiting to  see what happens with Australia's legal cases.  The legislation is now scheduled to go into effect next year. In his Moscow conference email, Koddermann also expressed pleasure at the fate of a proposal on farmers. Initial language would have recommended that countries restrict support for tobacco growers. The proposal was  significantly watered down,  he wrote.  This is a very positive result.  Gustavo Bosio, at the time a manager for international trade, chimed in a few days after the conference in an email:  These excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow.  Philip Morris isn't alone in seeking to weaken the treaty. Ahead of the 2012 FCTC conference, in Seoul, four cigarette giants – Philip Morris, British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Brands Plc – formed an  informal industry Working Group  to oppose various proposals on tobacco taxation, according to an internal BAT document reviewed by Reuters. The 45-page paper, whose existence hasn't been previously reported, noted that the group would coordinate  to the extent that these issues do not raise any anti-competitive concerns.  The paper outlined a global campaign planned by BAT to counter the FCTC, which was  increasingly going beyond  its mandate. And it listed objectives, including a bid to block discussions around the introduction of a minimum 70 percent tax on tobacco. BAT declined to answer questions about the industry working group. Both Imperial and Japan Tobacco International said they didn't want to comment on a document from a competitor. Japan Tobacco International said its tax experts met with counterparts from other tobacco companies to discuss treaty guidelines on taxation ahead of the 2012 conference. Philip Morris did not comment on the document. Wooing Delegates The Philip Morris emails and documents don't explicitly detail how the company pulled off the victories in Moscow. But they provide insight into the importance it places on wooing delegates. The FCTC traditionally makes decisions by consensus, and so influencing a single national delegation can have an outsized impact. The treaty has a key clause meant to keep the industry from unduly influencing delegations. Article 5.3, as it's known, says nations should protect their public health policies from tobacco interests. Guidelines that accompany Article 5.3 recommend that countries interact with the industry only when  strictly necessary.  But the article – a single sentence – contains a loophole Philip Morris has exploited. The sentence ends with the words  in accordance with national law,  opening the door to arguments by pro-tobacco forces that any lobbying that's legal in a certain country is permissible when interacting with that country's representatives. They also argue that a sentence in a related document, the guidelines for Article 5.3, allows for such interactions to take place as long as they are conducted transparently. One of the company's targets has been Vietnam. The day the Moscow meeting ended, Koddermann received an email from his colleague Nguyen Thanh Ky, a leading corporate affairs executive for Vietnam. Ky said he had a  debrief lunch  with the Vietnamese delegation and had a good outcome to report: The delegation was in favor of  moderate and reasonable measures  to be implemented over a  practical timeline,  he wrote. He did not specify which measures they discussed. The Vietnamese delegation spoke up often during the Moscow meeting. A review of notes compiled by tobacco-control groups accredited as observers showed Vietnam's interjections frequently mirrored Philip Morris' positions on tobacco-control regulations. Just like the tobacco giant, the Vietnamese said a higher tax on cigarettes would lead to more illicit sales. Like Philip Morris, they said the FCTC should stay out of trade disputes. And like Philip Morris, they opposed proposals to set uniform parameters for the legal liability of tobacco companies. The FCTC guidelines on taxation did ultimately include a WHO recommendation for a minimum tax of 70 percent – something Philip Morris opposed. But the proposal to give the treaty more sway over trade disputes was weakened, and measures to strengthen the legal liability of cigarette companies were delayed. Vietnam's foreign ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters. Secret Rendezvous As soon as the conference ended, the documents show, Philip Morris turned to the next one: the 2016 meeting in India. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation outlined the need to identify ways to gather intelligence during the Delhi conference. In a separate 2015 planning document, the company talks about the arrangement of farmer protests in the run-up to the meeting. Such protests did take place – including one in front of WHO offices in New Delhi. Reuters couldn't determine whether Philip Morris was behind those demonstrations. While other major tobacco companies also sent people to Delhi in November, Philip Morris was distinguished by its stealth. Executives from the company did not sign in with their tobacco industry colleagues at the FCTC convention center and stayed at a hotel about an hour's drive away. The anonymity and distance helped Philip Morris approach delegates covertly. On the second day of the conference, a white Toyota van pulled away from the front of the Hyatt Regency hotel – where Philip Morris had its operations room – and headed for the FCTC treaty venue. The van was carrying Ky, its corporate affairs executive from Vietnam. Ky's driver talked his way past police at the barricade outside the conference center, where FCTC-issued credentials were checked, explaining that he was driving  VIPs,  the driver later told Reuters. A few minutes later, a man in a dark suit walked out of the conference center, passed the van and stopped at a street corner. The van did a U-turn, and a Reuters reporter saw the man in the suit quickly climb in. He was a senior member of Vietnam's delegation to the FCTC conference: Nguyen Vinh Quoc, a Vietnamese government official. The driver, Kishore Kumar, said in an interview that he dropped the two men off at a local hotel. Kumar said that on several other occasions that week, he took Ky to pick up people from the Hotel Formule1, a budget lodging where Vietnam's delegation was staying during the conference. Ky and Quoc did not respond to requests for comment. Asked by Reuters about the interaction between Ky and the Vietnam representatives, Philip Morris executive Andrew Cave thumped on the table in a bar at the hotel where company representatives were staying. Reuters should focus, he said, on efforts by the industry to develop so-called reduced-risk products – those that deliver nicotine without the burning of tobacco and which the company says reduce harm. When pressed about the meetings with Vietnam, Cave thumped the table again:  I'm angry that you're focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.  In a subsequent email, Cave said:  Representatives from Philip Morris International met with delegates from Vietnam  during the Delhi conference  to discuss policy issues and this complied fully with PMI's internal procedures and the laws and regulations of Vietnam.  Delegates, Cave said in separate interviews, are reluctant to meet openly with Philip Morris because they are afraid of being  named and shamed  by anti-smoking groups. 'Slavery Ended a Long Time Ago' Some delegates questioned the extent to which Philip Morris shaped the decisions made at the Moscow conference, saying attendees genuinely disagreed on certain issues. Nuntavarn Vichit-Vadakan, a Thai delegate, oversaw many discussions as the chair of an FCTC committee at the Moscow conference. She said delegates differed over the regulation of e-cigarettes, for instance, and any lobbying the company carried out would not have determined the outcome. The Philip Morris documents leave questions unanswered. In some cases, the documents show the company hatching plans to change an anti-smoking regulation or to monitor activists, but don't always make clear to what extent or how the plans were executed, if at all. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation called for  achieving scrutiny  of tobacco control advocates and said a  global project team  had been established for this purpose. It did not list what means would be used. In some instances, Philip Morris' lobbying plainly failed. In July 2015, the Ugandan parliament passed sweeping new anti-tobacco laws inspired by the treaty. All that was needed was President Yoweri Museveni's signature, and the small African nation would become a leader on the continent in implementing a strict interpretation of the FCTC. Philip Morris sent an executive, a younger white man, to tell the septuagenarian president, who long ago had helped topple dictator Idi Amin, why the tobacco act was a bad idea. Sheila Ndyanabangi, Uganda's lead health official for tobacco issues who was present at the meeting, described the executive's approach as lecturing the statesman.  He said, 'Ugandan tobacco will be too expensive' and 'it will not be competitive,'  Ndyanabangi said. Her account was confirmed by a senior Ugandan government official who was also present. Museveni stared for a moment at the Philip Morris executive and a representative from a major tobacco buyer who'd come with him. The president then declared:  Slavery ended a long time ago.  There was a long silence in the room, recalled Ndyanabangi. Museveni said Uganda didn't need tobacco, and the meeting was over. The president signed the bill that September. Museveni's office did not respond to requests for comment. Changing the Delegations Over time, however, the industry's lobbying has slowed the treaty's progress. At the biennial conferences, the discussions have changed. In Moscow, for instance, there was a strong focus on trade and taxes.  You could see from the floor that interventions were very, very, very much focusing on the trade aspects, many times even putting trade over health,  the FCTC's da Costa e Silva said in an interview last year. The composition of FCTC delegations sent by governments has changed to include more members who aren't involved in health policy. That's in line with what Philip Morris and other tobacco companies want: Philip Morris, as well as British American Tobacco, has sought to move the balance of the membership away from public health officials and toward ministries like finance and trade. Such agencies, said the former Philip Morris executive, benefit from tobacco tax revenues and attach less weight to health concerns.  The health department would just want tobacco to be banned, while for the finance ministry it's more like how can we leverage or get as much money as we can,  he said. The object of Philip Morris' efforts, according to the 2014 PowerPoint on corporate affairs, is to  move tobacco issues away  from health ministries and demonstrate there are broader public interests at play – that  it's not about tobacco.  Cave, the Philip Morris corporate affairs executive, confirmed the company tries to persuade governments to change the composition of delegations. Health officials, he said, aren't equipped to handle the intricacies of issues such as taxation.  You're looking at illicit trade, you're looking at tax regimes, you're looking at international law,  he said.  Now each of these areas, it's logical, if you want to really tackle the trade and tobacco smuggling, illicit trade, who would you go to? You wouldn't go to the health ministry.  Reuters analyzed the rosters of the almost 3,500 accredited delegation members who have attended the seven FCTC conferences since 2006. The analysis found that there were more than six health delegates for every finance-related delegate in 2006. In Delhi last year, that ratio had fallen to just over three health delegates for every finance delegate. The number of delegates from finance, agriculture and trade fields has risen from a few dozen in 2006 to more than 100 in recent years. Vietnam's delegation, for example, has changed markedly. At the first FCTC conference in 2006, none of its four delegates were from finance or trade ministries. By 2014, in Moscow, there were 13 delegates, with at least four from finance-related ministries, including the chief delegate. Vietnam's foreign ministry did not respond to questions about the delegation. Da Costa e Silva isn't opposed to having delegates from trade ministries, but she says their primary focus needs to be on health. And she was concerned by the makeup of the Vietnamese delegation. In a letter to the Vietnamese prime minister in late 2015, she asked that tobacco industry employees be excluded from the delegation. If they weren't, she wrote, Vietnam might be  unable to play a full part in discussions.  In 2016, Vietnam brought 11 delegates to the conference, of whom six were from health agencies, including the chief representative. Some tobacco-control activists who attended the Delhi meeting in November say it was the worst so far in terms of passing new anti-smoking provisions. Matthew Myers, who heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said multiple countries came prepared to consciously block action. He said he heard delegates making arguments  I haven’t heard in 25 years.  A Nigerian delegate, for instance, asked to remove a reference to  the tobacco epidemic  from a draft proposal on liability for tobacco-related harm, according to notes taken by anti-smoking groups. Asked for comment, Christiana Ukoli, head of the delegation in Delhi, said the  Nigerian delegation strongly dissociates itself from statement.  The Delhi conference ended as it began, with treaty Secretariat officials not knowing where Philip Morris had been or what it had done. The company had flown in a team of executives, used a squad of identical vans to ferry officials in New Delhi, and then left town without a trace.

The agency believes app-based providers are likely to continue disrupting conventional business models in the taxi industry, leaving the credit profiles of conventional operators under pressure in the short to medium term. The Ministry of Transportation's new regulations - Permenhub No. 26/2017 - which supersedes Permenhub No. 32/2016, became effective on 1 July 2017. The new rules introduce minimum and maximum tariffs for app-based services that are almost the same as that of conventional taxis; app-based tariffs range from IDR3,500-6,000 per km in Java, Bali and Sumatera, and IDR3,700-6,500 per km in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku and Papua. The regulations also stipulate fleet quotas for each city and introduce a vehicle road-worthiness test for cars, as is required for conventional taxis, further placing the two services on par. However, Fitch believes enforcing this will be challenging. In addition, the pricing mechanism slightly favours app-based services, as some set a fixed fare for the whole journey, removing consumer uncertainty as to the total cost of travel. Conventional taxi operators, like PT Blue Bird Tbk and PT Express Transindo Utama Tbk, charge flag-fall fees of around IDR6,500 per ride, waiting fees of around IDR40,000 per hour and a minimum charge (if the taxi is ordered by phone) of IDR15,000-20,000 per ride on top of per km fees. This creates an impression that conventional taxis are more expensive than their app-based peers. App users can also choose higher-rated cars, with each car being rated by the user rating after a ride, increasing the appeal of these services. Both Blue Bird and Express have teamed up with app-based providers to expand their networks, as this allows them to be included in the app's car-searching algorithm when a consumer books a car. Blue Bird teamed up with GoCar in 2016, while Express partnered with Grab in 2015 and Uber in 2016. However, the partnership have seen limited improvement in conventional operators' financial profiles; Blue Bird's revenue fell by 32% yoy in the 12 months to March 2017 and its EBITDA fell by 18% yoy. Express's revenue declined by 48% yoy and its EBITDA declined by 66% yoy during the same period. Express's situation is further exacerbated by the large proportion of its drivers under a fixed daily rental scheme; these drivers find it difficult to make payments to Express, as their revenue has declined due to weakening demand. Express' leverage, measured by net debt/ EBITDA, increased to 9.5x in 1Q17, from 6.2x in 2016, and receivable days lengthened to 334 days, from 274 days, in the same period. The new regulations also fail to address app-based providers of two-wheeled transport, such as Grab Bike, Gojek and Uber Motor, which operate in a legal grey area. Two-wheeled transport providers are not explicitly banned, but a 2009 Ministry of Transportation statute does not include these vehicles as a means of public transport, citing safety concerns. Fitch believes app-based two-wheeled transport providers have stolen market share from conventional taxi operators, although to a lesser extent than their four-wheeled counterparts.

Not a bit of it, says embattled Formula One team owner Vijay Mallya. The flamboyant businessman, currently fighting a high-profile Indian extradition request, speaks instead of 'enjoying the fruits' of his labors on track and planning high-flying Force India's next decade. He is also, despite the court appearances and travel restrictions, still living the good life and enjoying a summer of sport. Horse racing at Royal Ascot, the Wimbledon tennis championships and Champions Trophy cricket have all been on his social diary, along with Wednesday's Formula One promotional event in London.  There’s nothing to miss,  the 61-year-old told Reuters at the British Grand Prix when asked if he missed India.  All my immediate family is either in England or the U.S. Nobody in India at all. As far as my step-siblings are concerned, they are all UK citizens. So there’s nothing family-wise to miss.  India is seeking Mallya's extradition over $1.4 billion that the authorities say he owes as a result of loans tied to his defunct Kingfisher Airlines. Mallya has dismissed the charges against him.  This witch hunt against me has been going on for a while,  said Mallya, who has lived in Britain since 1992 and considers it a second home.  So it isn’t as if I have any emotional ups and downs. I have done absolutely nothing wrong. In fact I am glad that it is finally before a UK court and an impartial court. So we wait and see how it plays out.  The full extradition hearing has been provisionally listed to start on Dec. 4 and to last two weeks. Until the issue is resolved, Mallya cannot leave Britain but he said that was no hardship, even if Silverstone is likely to be his first and last appearance in the Formula One paddock this year. Novelty Value  I enjoy this atmosphere ... I enjoy meeting all the guests and sponsors and walking around the paddock. But while I enjoy it, there’s no novelty value any more,  he said.  I’ve been there and done it.   When I first started I went to every single race to the point where it was getting a bit exhausting, going to 20 races in a year. So it’s not as if I’m missing something.  If you look at my role in the team, there’s nothing for me to miss. I am participating in all the decision making and I’ve got a virtual pit wall at home.  I miss being around but I'm also happy in my space. My time will come and I’ll go back to the tracks.  Mallya took over the failing Jordan team a decade ago and renamed it Force India as a measure of his pride in setting up India's first Formula One entry. The talk now is of taking India out of the name to attract the sort of big name sponsors who want a global reach rather than a regional focus.  Things have changed. Force India is getting very limited in terms of potential. The Indian Grand Prix is gone, sadly. There are no Indian sponsors who’ve come to the table. They seem to be spending all their money on cricket,  said Mallya.  And I need, for the continuing financial stability of this team, to reach out to more international sponsors.  We have to think about positioning the team for the next 10 years,  he said, adding that he intended to be around as well. Force India are currently fourth overall in the constructors' standings, the position they finished in last year.   When the team is doing well, then I am able to enjoy the fruits of my labor over so many years,  said Mallya.  Getting the right people and culture in place and motivating them and developing a car that has fought in the world championship -- that’s no coincidence or stroke of luck. This is proper performance.  This is the time I’m enjoying the fruits of my 10 years of ownership.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index was 0.5 percent, or 27.37 points, higher at 5,763.70 by 0235 GMT after a 1.1 percent rise on Thursday. The benchmark has added over 1 percent so far this week, heading toward its strongest weekly rise since the week ended June 16. The day's gains rode on a solid rise in energy and financial stocks, with the Australian energy index on track to record its best trading day since early May with a 2.4 percent rise. Aussie energy sector bellwether Woodside Petroleum, an oil and gas explorer, climbed 2.1 percent boosted by overnight advances in oil prices, which came on the back of data showing stronger Chinese demand for crude. Smaller rivals Oil Search and Santos rose about 1.7 percent each. Origin Energy, which has significant natural gas interests, was also helped by the rise in oil, gaining 2.7 percent and thereby single-handedly pushing up the utilities sector. The Australian financial index followed U.S. financials higher as investors bought in before second quarter earnings kicked-off with three of the biggest U.S. banks reporting results.  Our markets are looking ahead to the reporting (earnings)from the U.S. with a degree of optimism,  said Tony Farnham, an economist with Patersons Securities. A Reuters survey showed second-quarter earnings for S&P; 500 companies rose 7.8 percent from a year ago, with financials projected to have had the third-best profit growth among sectors. The Aussie big banks rose in a range of 0.7 percent to 1.2 percent and were the biggest contributors to overall gains. Meanwhile, the second leg of U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's testimony, this time before a Senate panel, further buttressed her advocacy of a gradual rate of policy tightening. Investors have seen Yellen's dovish tone as a green light for riskier trades on Wall Street. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index added 0.3 percent or 23.24 points to 7,634.13, and was on track for a fifth straight week of increases. Gains were concentrated in consumer, utilities and financial shares with dairy products maker a2 Milk and energy retail business Mercury NZ Ltd the biggest advancers on the benchmark, up 1.5 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. Mourning his death, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Liu was a  courageous fighter for civil rights and freedom of expression , while the French, British and U.S. governments called on China to allow Liu's family to move around freely. Already seriously ill, Liu, a thorn in the ruling Communist Party's side since he helped negotiate a deal to allow protesters to leave Tiananmen Square before troops and tanks rolled in, was moved last month from prison to a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang. The Shenyang Bureau of Justice said in a brief statement on its website that Liu had suffered multiple organ failure and efforts to save him had failed. Though allowed out on medical parole he was never freed, spending his final days in the hospital surrounded by security guards. Teng Yue'e, the chief doctor treating Liu, told a news conference in a nearby hotel that Liu died at 5:35 PM (0935 GMT) surrounded by his family.  When Mr. Liu Xiaobo died, he was not in any pain at that moment, he was very much at peace, because all of his relatives said their goodbyes beforehand. So when we saw him we thought he was very much at peace,  Teng said. The leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee which, to Beijing's ire, awarded Liu the peace prize in 2010, said the Chinese government bore a heavy responsibility for his death.  We find it deeply disturbing that Liu Xiaobo was not transferred to a facility where he could receive adequate medical treatment before he became terminally ill,  said Berit Reiss-Andersen in an emailed statement. China said at the time that Liu's award was an  obscenity  that should not have gone to a man it called a criminal and a subversive. Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist who died in 1938 in Nazi Germany's Berlin, was the last Nobel Peace Prize winner to live out his dying days under state surveillance. Reform Call Related CoverageChina should allow Liu's wife to travel abroad, German minister saysWest mourns Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, criticizes BeijingU.N. chief 'deeply saddened' by Chinese dissident's deathWestern governments criticized Beijing for not allowing him to seek treatment for his cancer overseas and called on China to loosen its restrictions on dissent.  China has lost a deeply principled role model who deserved our respect and adulation, not the prison sentences to which he was subjected,  said U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad. Tsai Ing-wen, the president of self-ruled Taiwan which China regards as a wayward province, said on her Facebook page the island hoped China could now show self-confidence and promote political reform.  Only through democracy, in which every Chinese person has freedom and respect, can China truly become a proud and important country,  she said. In China, while mention of Liu's passing was swiftly removed from Weibo, the country's answer to Twitter, images and comments were shared on the WeChat messaging service. Some activists shared a picture of a black screen with the years 1955-2017 - his lifespan - or of a single candle superimposed over his face.  Mr. Liu, rest in peace,  wrote rights lawyer Zhang Peihong on his WeChat account. Pro-democracy activists mourn the death of Chinese Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 13, 2017.Bobby YipState news agency Xinhua reported the death only in English in a brief story that noted he had been seen by  China's top-rated cancer experts . State-run tabloid the Global Times said in an English-language editorial on its website early Friday morning that Liu's last days were politicized by overseas forces.   They used Liu's illness as a tool to boost their image and demonize China,  it said.  While Chinese doctors were doing their best to save Liu, they clamored and asked the critically ill patient to be transferred abroad only to show their so-called 'sympathy'.  Freedom of Movement        United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein urged China to guarantee his widow, Liu Xia, freedom of movement, and allow her to travel abroad should she want to. Liu Xia has lived under house arrest since 2010.  Despite the imprisonment and separation from the wife he adored that could have fueled anger and bitterness, Liu Xiaobo declared that he had no hatred for those who pursued and prosecuted him,  Zeid said.    Slideshow (16 Images)Rights groups and Western governments had urged China to allow Liu and his wife to leave the country to be treated abroad, as Liu had said he wanted. But the government said Liu was being treated by renowned Chinese cancer experts and the hospital said he was too sick to travel. Beijing did allow two foreign doctors, from the United States and Germany, to visit Liu on Saturday. They later said they considered it was safe for him to be moved overseas. Family friend and fellow dissident Hu Jia said the authorities would not let him die in peace.  To some extent, this was an attempt by the Party to show their strength, to show that they control your life if you live in China,  he told Reuters.   But I think the historic message they are leaving is very different. By letting a Nobel peace prize winner die in custody they lost a chance to show humanity and instead proved their cold-blooded nature.  In the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, which enjoys broad freedoms not granted in mainland China, around 100 protesters gathered in silence outside Beijing's representative office, some quietly sobbing and others with their heads.  Many held signs reading  The people's hero, he'll always be remembered,   the murder of a dissident  and  free Liu Xia . A White House statement on Thursday said President Donald Trump was  deeply saddened  to learn of Liu's death.       At an earlier news conference during a visit to Paris, Trump made no mention of Liu when asked about the U.S.-China relationship, but instead chose to praise Chinese President Xi Jinping as a “great leader,” a “very talented man” and a “very good man.”  “President Xi is a terrific guy. I like being with him a lot. And he’s a very special person,” Trump said.  Earlier on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Liu’s death “tragic” and called on China to free his widow. A White House official said on Wednesday that Trump raised Liu's case in a July 2 telephone call with Xi, while the U.S. national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, raised it with his Chinese counterpart at the G20 meeting last week. Additional reporting by Christian Shepherd, and James Pomfret and Venus Wu in Hong Kong, J.R.

The region's future growth and security - as well as the welfare of hundreds of millions of people - are at stake, said a new report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).   Countries in Asia and the Pacific are at the highest risk of plummeting into deeper poverty - and disaster - if (climate change) mitigation and adaptation efforts are not quickly and strongly implemented,  said Bambang Susantono, the ADB's vice-president for sustainable development.  The landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which came into force last November, pledges to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times.   Related CoverageFactbox: Floods, reef loss and migration: Asia's future on a hotter planetEarly and aggressive measures are needed to achieve that goal, the report said. If the world continues to emit planet-warming greenhouse gases as now, global mean temperature would increase by over 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, with parts of Asia-Pacific seeing a rise of 6 degrees, it added.  Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwestern China could experience even hotter climates, with temperatures rising 8 degrees Celsius, it added. This would bring drastic changes in the region's weather, biodiversity, agriculture and fisheries, and drive migration as some parts become less habitable, said the report.  Such a scenario may even pose an existential threat to some countries in the region, and crush any hope of achieving sustainable and inclusive development,  the ADB said in a statement. Asia-Pacific is home to two-thirds of the world's population and nine out of 15 countries listed as most vulnerable to natural hazards globally. Millions of people in South Asia are already affected by rising temperatures, and despite impressive economic growth, United Nations' figures show one in 10 Asians still live in extreme poverty.  Investments to rapidly shift Asia's economy onto a low-carbon path must be a high priority because the coming decade is crucial to achieving the Paris Agreement goals, the report said.  Many countries in the region still rely heavily on fossil fuels for energy. The ADB said it would invest $4 billion by 2020 to promote renewable energy supplies and green growth across the region.

The measures will be the first in an expected wave of global legislation as pressure mounts on technology companies to provide such access after several terror suspects used encrypted applications ahead of attacks. Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, is on heightened alert for attacks by home-grown radicals since 2014 and authorities have said they have thwarted several plots, although Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said law enforcement needed more help.  We need to ensure the internet is not used as a dark place for bad people to hide their criminal activities from the law,  Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.  The reality is, however, that these encrypted messaging applications and voice applications are being used obviously by all of us, but they're also being used by people who seek to do us harm.  Australia's proposal will require device manufacturers and technology companies to help its law enforcement agencies intercept and read messages sent by suspects. The proposal, to be introduced when parliament resumes in August, could be adopted within months, lawmakers have said. But the plan sets the scene for a clash between Australia's government and some of the world's biggest technology companies. Apple, which declined a request by Reuters to comment on the proposal, has previously resisted sharing such information, citing privacy concerns. A Facebook spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While Australia is poised to become the first country to adopt laws on encrypted messages, other nations have said they will introduce similar laws. Several European nations, including France and Britain, have committed to new laws requiring access to encrypted messages, a key issue in this month's talks among the  Five Eyes  intelligence-sharing network.

Oscar Perez, 36, who also is an action film star who portrays himself as a James Bond-cum-Rambo figure on social media, surprised opposition supporters by popping up at a Caracas event to mark the deaths of about 100 people related to anti-government unrest that started in April.  We don't want any more blood on the streets,  he said.  Perez, flanked by young men clad in balaclavas and surrounded by cameras, said the opposition must continue protesting. On Sunday, the opposition will hold an unofficial referendum to let Venezuelans have their say on Maduro's plan to rewrite the constitution.

Perez has appeared only once since that incident - in a video saying he was in Caracas and keeping up the fight against the government of unpopular President Nicolas Maduro, who has called Perez a terrorist. Slideshow (5 Images)Venezuela is undergoing a major crisis as hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent months calling for an end to Maduro's presidency, amid food shortages, a collapsing currency and soaring inflation.

His Instagram feed shows him riding horseback in combat gear, scuba-diving with rifles and pistols and jumping out of a helicopter with a dog.

I think as soon as tomorrow, the House (of Representatives) could pass it out,  Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an author of the bill, told reporters. He said he expected the House to make changes that would not affect the bill's overall character and to address issues that have worried energy companies, such as a provision that oil firms said could block them out of international exploration projects if Russian firms were also involved. Hoping to send a message to President Donald Trump to maintain a strong line against Moscow, the Senate passed the sanctions on Russia, part of a broader measure also imposing new sanctions on Iran, by 98-2 on June 15. The bill has been mired in the House ever since. The delay has frustrated Democrats, and some of Trump's fellow Republicans, who think the president is so eager to improve relations with Russia that he will not retaliate for Moscow's international aggression. This week, Trump has been defending his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Republicans, who control Congress, said the House could not vote on the Senate bill because it violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues originate in the House. Democrats accused Republicans of stalling because of Trump administration concern about a provision setting up a process for Congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on Russia. Seeking a greater influence in foreign policy, Congress has included such  review  provisions in a few recent major bills, starting with Corker's 2015 legislation forcing congressional review of President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. Corker said he thought there should be more congressional review of foreign policy.  It's been my goal as chairman just to bring back our equivalent status to the executive branch, and this is one way of doing so.   House aides said negotiations on the Russia bill were continuing.  No deal has been reached, but talks have been productive and will continue,  said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan.

Common Cause, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Public Knowledge and other groups echoed other critics of the deal, including some lawmakers, who say that the $85.4 billion deal would give AT&T; (T.N), owner of DirecTV, the ability to withhold Time Warner's (TWX.N) content from other outlets and hurt the move to show television shows and movies on the Internet. The groups argued that after buying Time Warner, owner of HBO and TNT, AT&T; would have the incentive to restrict sales of that programming to cable and online channels. That could hurt DirecTV's rivals as well as AT&T;'s competitors in providing video online, the letter said. The groups also worried that the deal would create incentives for AT&T; to refrain from showing independent programmers. The groups said that the deal  poses ... grave dangers to consumers and creators in mature and emerging markets  and urged the government to consider stopping it.  If you conclude, as appears to us from the available information, that conditions and piecemeal divestitures will not be sufficient, then we hope you will challenge the merger in its entirety,  the groups said in their letter to Sessions. Aside from the Justice Department's antitrust review, the deal is at the center of a controversy over allegations that White House advisers considered using the probe as political leverage. Time Warner owns news station CNN, which President Donald Trump has criticized. AT&T; did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department declined comment on the letter.

The insurers have significant exposure to risky and illiquid assets, such as long-term equities and properties, and rely heavily on new premium inflows to support liquidity needs, as the duration of assets and liabilities are not well matched on these exposures. However, a series of regulatory measures to reduce the sale of short-term savings-type products have slowed premium growth, and the lack of an agency force makes substitute sales of more complicated protection-oriented products challenging. A slowdown in premium inflow may force insurers to dispose of assets to support cash outflow if cash and other liquid assets on hand are insufficient to cover payments, particularly if there is a spike in surrenders. Forced asset sales could cause losses and impairments, particularly in illiquid long-term equity investments and properties. Among China's five major short-term product sellers, Anbang Life Insurance Co., Ltd had the highest level of liquid assets, including cash, bank deposits and repos, covering 59% of its total insurance liabilities as of end-2016. Funde Sino Life Insurance Co., Ltd. had the smallest coverage at just 12%. Meanwhile, the insurers had risky assets - including stocks, funds, long-term equities and properties - to shareholder equity that averaged a high 5.4x at end-2016. Concentration on single-name equity investment or riskier  under construction  property investment also tends to be high. However, industry-wide liquidity pressure or sharp falls in the value of most life insurers' investment portfolios is not probable, given the insurers' overall modest asset size. China's five major universal life providers accounted for 14% of total life insurance assets at end-2016. The other 19 short-term-policy focused insurers represented an additional 4.0% market share by assets.

Big U.S. banks start reporting quarterly results on Friday and according to data from State Street, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF.P), which tracks the S&P; 500 Financials sector .SPSY, has pulled in a net $662 million of inflows, bringing the year-to-date inflows to nearly $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, the Financial Select ETF is up 7.6 percent to $25.01.  There is good reason for investors to be optimistic about the financial sector,  said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  We just had two rounds of stress tests that every single bank passed with flying colors. In general, the banking industry is in very good shape right now,  he said. Shares in the biggest U.S. banks rose at the end of June after they unveiled buyback and dividend plans that topped analyst expectations after the U.S. Federal Reserve approved capital proposals in its annual stress test program. Some of the fund's top holdings, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), report results on Friday and others, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) will post results next week. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for S&P; 500 financial companies rose 7 percent, the third-best growth for a sector after energy and technology, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The financial earnings are going to probably be better-than-expected because we have seen a tick up in the yield curve, and that is going to be better for net interest income,  said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in Charleston, South Carolina. Longer-dated Treasury yields have jumped so far this month while shorter-dated yields have either inched higher or fallen, resulting in a so-called  steepening  of the yield curve. A steeper yield curve benefits bank profitability since it allows banks to borrow at lower short-term rates and lend at higher long-term rates.  Financials have managed to make money no matter what gets thrown at them. Regulations, zero interest rates, they still come through. So I think that we're going to see a positive surprise,  Cavanaugh said. Traders in the options market appear to expect the fund's shares to rise in the near term. For XLF options contracts expiring on July 21, which will cover results from the largest banks, there are 1.2 calls open for each open put. For contracts expiring after this date, the measure stands at 0.77 calls per open put, a significantly more defensive stance. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and usually are used to place bets on shares rising, while put options give the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future. Options on the SPDR S&P; Bank ETF (KBE.P) and individual bank stocks including Bank of America Corp also show a similar bullish bias in near-term contracts. On Thursday, trading in XLF's options leaned toward bullish bets, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.

Wie, who had her neck massaged on course, contrived a makeshift ice pack after fishing out ice cubes from a tee-side cooler, and trailed her caddie keeping a hand on her golf bag for balance at Trump National. The 2014 champion, who initially hurt her neck at the KPMG Women's PGA Championship two weeks ago, laughed the laugh of a winner after her birdie putt dropped into the cup at the 18th for a happy ending and a one-over-par 73. Wie initially hurt her neck at the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship two weeks ago.  I was so happy to be able to tee it up today. I didn't hit a single golf ball since KPMG. Didn't hit a single shot on the golf course here,  Wie told reporters after finishing following a long thunderstorm delay.  I knew I needed a small miracle and I was excited, so giddy playing today.  Wie said she had felt alright until returning after the 125-minute weather stoppage. The 27-year-old from Hawaii called a rules official over at the par-three 14th and was ready to pull out, but physios arrived and, granted 15 minutes for treatment, she was able to carry on.  I'm proud of myself and my caddie for keeping me in there,  said Wie after shooting even par over the last four holes in the rain.  I positioned myself OK. Three more days to go, so I'm excited about that.

A successful trade would be the first in Thailand from the Laos private sector, following early deals from the Lao People’s Democratic Republic’s Ministry of Finance and state-owned EDL-Generation. The Laos government is in the midst of finalising plans for its annual issuance, which is expected to take place at the end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter. Kolao, which is listed on the Korea stock exchange, holds the Laos franchise for Kia and Hyundai and produces its own vehicles. It receievd a BBB- rating from Thai rating agency Tris in early July with a stable outlook. Although there is no mention of a bond issuance in the rating report, two Thai banks Kasikornbank and Krungthai Bank are believed to be working with Kolao on a potential issue. A deal is unlikely to materialise in the near future as Kolao, as a foreign borrower, will need to apply for approval from Thailand’s Ministry of Finance to raise funds in the country. The next borrowing window for applications from foreign issuers closes this month. Kolao has an outstanding bond that is due to mature in August. The three-year S$60 million ($43.6 million) 2 percent bond, sold in Singapore, came with a guarantee from the Asian Development Bank’s Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF). Kolao has a market capitalisation of around $250.6 million, and is majority-owned by Korean individual Oh Sei-Young. Its maiden bond in Thailand will test demand among Thai investors for a privately-owned credit. Thai investors have previously shown robust appetite for bonds sold by the Laos government and EDL-Generation, but confidence in higher-risk local credits took a knock recently after a spate of defaults on bills of exchange. “Some of these companies are rated in the Triple B band, and this could have undermined some of the appetite in this rated band of credits,” said one Thai banker. The most recent prominent default came from Energy Earth , which was rated BBB- by Tris before it defaulted on 717.5 million baht ($21.2 million) debt in early June. The company also failed to redeem 160 million baht of bills of exchange due in June. Nevertheless, recent issues reflected healthy demand even for unrated, albeit small-sized, bonds. Property Perfect managed to sell close to 1.2 billion baht of unrated bonds while TPI Polene, rated BBB+, raised 4 billion baht in two and three years in the first week of July. Another hurdle facing Kolao is Thailand’s rule that foreign issuers cannot take the proceeds of a baht-denominated bond offshore. But the company, which reports its financial results in US dollars, is expected to issue in US dollars, where the rule does not apply. This strategy was applied by the Laos government to circumvent the Thai MOF’s rule when it printed a maiden $182 million onshore bond in Thailand in December last year. The Laos government is however expected to issue in baht when it returns to the market. It will use the proceeds to repay short-dated loans denominated in US dollars extended by Thai commercial banks, a move that will keep the bond proceeds onshore. Laos has a 1.794 billion baht three-year 4.76 percent bond due in October.

As a Formula Two title contender, and Renault development driver, the 24-year-old is closer than he has ever been -- but also still some way off. He knows the clock is ticking and this season could be make-or-break.  I am the next one that’s ready. That’s the way I see it,  he told Reuters in an interview.  And if Jo does go, there’s only Lewis left.   And the rumors that go around about him, you’re never really sure what he’s going to be doing. I’m there and I’m ready if F1 needs another British driver.  With Renault incumbent Palmer yet to score in nine races, a vacancy looks likely. Whether Rowland's name will be picked from the hat is another matter, and the odds already appear more stacked against him than they were a few months ago. That is because former team favorite Robert Kubica is suddenly back in contention, after partially severing his forearm in a rally crash in 2011. Rowland recognizes the threat from the Polish race winner is real, but hopes he might at least get a chance for a head-to-head test.  Kubica’s had a long time off now and with his arm and everything I don’t know exactly where he’s at in terms of performance. I’d like to think that if you put me in a car (test) with him, I’d be there or thereabouts,  he said. On the Limit While Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull can place budding talent with customer teams, Renault do not have such an option. And timing is everything.  I’m probably on the limit now to get in. There’s not too many more years left,  recognized Rowland, who is currently second in the Formula Two championship and 49 points behind Monegasque Ferrari academy driver Charles Leclerc.  You have to have a bit of luck, and I’m aware of that. All I can do is keep pushing and keep doing the right things and fingers crossed that someone believes and gives me a go.  Winner of the 2011 McLaren Autosport BRDC award, which secured a Formula One test with McLaren, Rowland has always had more talent than money. Like Hamilton, plenty of parental sacrifices have been made to help him on the ladder.  We had no carpet in our living room for about four or five years,  he said.  Unfortunately I lost my dad when I was about 18. My mum still pays off his credit card bills from when I was karting at 12.   It was a big strain on my family and my dad put a lot into getting me where I am today. It was his dream for me to get to Formula One as well.  More than a decade ago, as a budding karter, Rowland went to Silverstone when Hamilton was racing in GP2 -- now Formula Two -- and got to know the future champion.  I remember just thinking wow, if I could be in his position and just racing in GP2,  he said.  But your goals change. Now I’m keen that the next time I go there -- not this year but the following year -- I want to be an F1 driver and I want to be who the people are coming to support.

The Olympic bronze medalist took advantage of calm morning conditions with a sizzling opening nine of five-under 31 to lead a pack that included perennial Women's Open contender Amy Yang,  world number one Ryu So-yeon and former number one Lydia Ko. A heavy thundershower interrupted the afternoon wave for two hours five minutes and play was called off due to failing light with 39 players needing to return early on Friday to finish. There were rumblings that Donald Trump was planning to drop in to a course he owns this weekend, which would add a layer of security and could trigger protests by activists who have found comments by the U.S. President demeaning to women. Eric Trump, his son, was spotted during the opening round signing autographs in the merchandising pavilion, where Trump teddy bears were among mementos for sale. Related CoverageGolf: Fun-loving Feng goes on attack for more titlesFeng, who played an event last week in China and arrived in Bedminster exhausted on Monday after an overnight flight, scored in bursts with two batches of three birdies in a bogey-free round at the course some 50 miles west of Manhattan.  I had three birdies in the first four holes and then after that I just felt so comfortable about everything,  said Feng, who had never broken 70 in 10 previous Women's Open appearances. South Korean Yang, who has finished top four in all but one of the last five championships, was one back in second place after a five-under 67. Jul 13, 2017; Bedminster, NJ, USA; Shanshan Feng reacts on the fifth hole during the first round of the U.S. Women's Open golf tournament at Trump National Golf Club-New Jersey. Mandatory Credit: Eric Sucar-USA TODAY SportsRyu, winner of this year's ANA Inspiration major, birdied three of her last five holes for a 68, while New Zealander Ko slipped from six under with two late bogeys in her 68 to also share third on the leaderboard. Late starter Carlota Ciganda of Spain also stood at four-under but with one hole to finish, while 15-year-old amateur Rachel Heck, the youngest player in the 156-player field, was three-under after 13 holes. Rio Games silver medalist Ko played in a group with Feng and gold medalist Park In-bee (77) in an Olympic podium threesome and bogeyed the last after hitting a wedge from the fringe rather than putting through the frog's hair.  Obviously a little disappointing to finish up with a bogey on the last, but when I see how many good par saves I made throughout the day, I'm okay with that,  the 20-year-old said. Feng took it relatively easy after arriving in Bedminster, limiting herself to nine holes of practice on Tuesday and Wednesday while spending extra time on her putting.   It was my sponsor's tournament in China last week and I felt like it was my responsibility to actually go support my sponsor,  Feng said.  Also, that was my first time to play in China this year, so I really wanted to see my family and all my friends back home.  Feng said the Kumho Tire Ladies Open had proved to be a good warm-up for her - the course was narrow and forced her to hit the ball straight.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were down 8 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $48.34 per barrel at 0151 GMT, but up 3.5 percent for the week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $45.98 per barrel, down 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, but up around 4 percent for the week. Crude prices are around levels in late November last year, when a group of oil producers including Russia and Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pledged to withhold around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of production between January this year and March 2018 in order to tighten the market. Oil analysts at research and brokerage firm Sanford C. Bernstein said that global oil stocks remain high.  For the first half of 2017, OECD inventories are likely to finish higher, rather than lower... The most plausible explanation is that OPEC compliance has been not as high as has been suggested,  Bernstein said.  OPEC will have to cut deeper and for longer if it wants to eliminate the inventory overhang and prices to rise,  Bernstein said. It added that the upside for oil prices looked limited even if OPEC took more action due to high U.S. shale production. Goldman Sachs said that the crude oil price outlook remained weak, largely due to rising cost efficiency from U.S. shale drillers.  We see potential for shale to breakeven at $45... (and) we see $45-$55 per barrel annual WTI range,  the U.S. investment bank said.

Three traders told Reuters they have cut the amount of oil they hold in tanks or decided not to renew storage contracts in the past year. A shift away from storage could potentially be bad news for tank operators running in the region like the Netherlands' Vopak and Oiltanking, a subsidiary of Hamburg-based Marquard & Bahls. Oiltanking declined comment, while Vopak did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  Storage in this backwardated market makes no sense as we won't be able to recoup the costs to store the oil,  said a Singapore-based trader in middle distillates, a group of oil products including gasoil and jet fuel. Backwardation refers to a market where prices for prompt-loading cargoes are higher than for months further out, making storage uneconomical. The trader, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media, added that his firm had recently decided not to renew a short-term storage lease. The Asian gasoil and fuel oil markets have been backwardated for most of this year. The spread between the front-month and second-month gasoil contract climbed to an over three-year high of 50 cents a barrel this week, while the fuel oil spread is trading at parity, compared with about minus $4 a tonne at the same time last year. To make money by holding oil products in tanks, the spread between gasoil prices for future months needs to be at about minus 60 to 70 cents a barrel or less to cover the cost of leasing tank space and borrowing the money to buy the fuel to fill it. And traders who are keeping some oil products in storage are putting pressure on tank operators to reduce rates, the sources said. For instance, oil trader Glencore has reduced its storage lease volume of middle distillates, while oil trader Vitol may be giving up some tank space for fuel oil though discussions are still ongoing, the three traders said. Glencore declined to comment, while Vitol did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Storage rates for middle distillates have dropped to about S$6.50 ($4.72) to S$7 per cubic metre from S$7.50 to S$8.50 around 1 to 2 years ago, while fuel oil tank rates have fallen to about S$5 to S$6 from S$6.50 to S$7 a few years ago, they said. Many traders are also re-negotiating contracts to shorter time periods of six months to 1 year, from longer term contracts of 2 to 5 years previously, two sources from storage operators said. Expanding capacity in the Johor Straits between Singapore and Malaysia has also put pressure on tank rates. Oiltanking commissioned the Karimun terminal with a total storage capacity of 730,000 cubic metres in mid-2016, while Jurong Port and Oiltanking are building a 200,000 cubic metre storage facility in Singapore, to be ready by 2019. Traders are also opting to store fuel oil in tankers as freight rates for very large crude carriers have halved from 1-1/2 years ago, the sources said.  Tankers provide more flexibility as they can meet bunker demand quickly without having to load and unload in tanks,  said a Singapore-based fuel oil trader.

Renaissance has claimed that environmental damages that pre-date its operations at Ponton have impeded its development plans. Renaissance won development rights for the Ponton block at auction last year. The area was previously operated by national oil company Pemex before a sweeping energy reform finalized in 2014 forced the Mexican oil giant to give up many of its fields to allow for a series of auctions that have attracted new producers. The force majeure approval safeguards the Canadian oil company's rights to the area as Pemex's challenge to the claim of environmental damages at the site under its watch is handled by Mexico's oil safety agency ASEA. The regulator did not provide a timeline for when the challenge would be resolved. Renaissance was co-founded in 2014 by Ian Telfer, chairman of Goldcorp Inc., the biggest gold miner in Mexico. The firm won several onshore blocks last year, and has said it would like to operate additional projects in Mexico, including possible onshore tie-ups with Pemex.

The proposed rule, endorsed in 2015 by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, would place numerical limits on  bycatch  of whales and other marine creatures, and suspend swordfish gillnet operations if any of the caps are exceeded. The regulation was expected to gain final approval from the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service. But it was withdrawn last month after the Commerce Department agency determined the cost to the commercial fishing industry outweighed conservation benefits, agency spokesman Michael Milstein said on Thursday.  In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, the environmental group Oceana accused the Commerce Department under President Donald Trump's administration of violating U.S. fisheries laws and the federal Administrative Procedures Act. The suit seeks a court order requiring the agency ultimately to put the restrictions into effect.  This rule is critical to protect endangered whales and turtles from death and injury in this wasteful fishery,  Oceana attorney Mariel Combs said. Drift gillnets, consisting of mile-long (1.8 km-long) strands of nylon mesh draped 200 feet (60 meters) deep in the ocean from surface floats, pose a hazard to a wide assortment of marine mammals and turtles that can become entangled and drown. According to Oceana, vessels targeting swordfish ended up discarding 61 percent of all animals caught in their gillnets from 2004 to 2017. The group also cited figures showing that 53 whales, 35 sea turtles and hundreds of dolphins, seals and sea lions were inadvertently captured between 2001 and 2015. Under the proposed rule, the swordfish grounds off Southern California would be temporarily closed to commercial harvests if bycatch limits set for any one of nine protected marine creatures were reached or exceeded, including bottlenose dolphins, four species of whale and four types of sea turtles. A temporary gillnet closure imposed in 2014 to protect endangered sea turtles in Southern California waters halted fishing operations for a fleet of 16 boats whose annual swordfish and thresher shark catch was then valued at about $1 million on average, a small fraction of California's overall commercial fishery. Milstein said commercial fishermen have adopted new measures to mitigate bycatch, including a device that lowers the top of the gillnet below the water's surface where whales and turtles are likely to swim.

The British government, seeking to highlight confidence in the British economy, said Spanish firms had committed millions of pounds of investment to Britain to coincide with a three-day state visit by King Felipe and Queen Letizia. Addressing business leaders in London, Felipe hailed the close ties between Britain and Spain. But he said:  We cannot deny that the scenario originated by the UK decision to leave the EU has generated uncertainty and doubts for our companies ... We must make sure the current negotiations reduce this uncertainty to the minimum.  It is extremely important that the future framework of our relations establishes the conditions for a close economic relationship trying to minimize future obstacles and barriers.  Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis told the event that Spain wanted a Britain that continued to be  bound together  with the rest of Europe. Bilateral trade between the two countries was worth 40 billion pounds ($51.68 billion) in 2015 and more than 400 Spanish companies are registered in Britain, the British government said. Investment Investments announced on Thursday included Spanish manufacturer CAF (CAF.MC) committing 30 million pounds ($39 million) to build trains and trams at a new factory in Wales, creating 300 jobs, and Spanish infrastructure company Sacyr (SCYR.MC) unveiling plans for a new office in London. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and Spain's King Felipe pose for a photograph before a meeting in 10 Downing Street, in central London, Britain July 13, 2017.Leon Neal/PoolSpanish Trade Minister Maria Luisa Poncela said:  Our common goal should be to achieve strong and collaborative relations with the United Kingdom while trying to avoid any unnecessary damage to our trade and investment flows.     The pomp-laden state visit, which included a banquet hosted by Queen Elizabeth on Wednesday, aims to cement ties that have been strained by questions over the post-Brexit status of Gibraltar, a British territory on the southern tip of Spain. The future of Gibraltar, captured by Britain in 1704, and its 30,000 inhabitants will be a major point of contention in the Brexit talks. The EU has offered Spain a right of veto over the territory's post-Brexit relationship with the bloc.  Slideshow (14 Images)During an address to the British parliament on Wednesday, Felipe said he was confident Spain and Britain could work toward an acceptable arrangement over Gibraltar. Prime Minister Theresa May's spokeswoman said the issue of Gibraltar did not come up during a bilateral meeting between the British leader and Felipe on Thursday.  Spain are well aware of our position on Gibraltar,  she told reporters.  We don't see eye to eye on this issue ... The sovereignty of Gibraltar is not up for discussion.  The pair did discuss EU citizens' rights post-Brexit, however. On Wednesday, Felipe urged the British and Spanish governments to work to ensure the Brexit agreement provided sufficient assurance and certainty for such citizens.  The EU and Britain have yet to agree on guarantees for EU citizens living in the UK and British expats living in other EU countries. More than 300,000 Britons live in Spain and more than 130,000 Spaniards live in Britain.

The proposed rule, endorsed in 2015 by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, would place numerical limits on  bycatch  of whales and other marine creatures, and suspend swordfish gillnet operations if any of the caps are exceeded. The regulation was expected to gain final approval from the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service. But it was withdrawn last month after the Commerce Department agency determined the cost to the commercial fishing industry outweighed conservation benefits, agency spokesman Michael Milstein said on Thursday.  In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, the environmental group Oceana accused the Commerce Department under President Donald Trump's administration of violating U.S. fisheries laws and the federal Administrative Procedures Act. The suit seeks a court order requiring the agency ultimately to put the restrictions into effect.  This rule is critical to protect endangered whales and turtles from death and injury in this wasteful fishery,  Oceana attorney Mariel Combs said. Drift gillnets, consisting of mile-long (1.8 km-long) strands of nylon mesh draped 200 feet (60 meters) deep in the ocean from surface floats, pose a hazard to a wide assortment of marine mammals and turtles that can become entangled and drown. According to Oceana, vessels targeting swordfish ended up discarding 61 percent of all animals caught in their gillnets from 2004 to 2017. The group also cited figures showing that 53 whales, 35 sea turtles and hundreds of dolphins, seals and sea lions were inadvertently captured between 2001 and 2015. Under the proposed rule, the swordfish grounds off Southern California would be temporarily closed to commercial harvests if bycatch limits set for any one of nine protected marine creatures were reached or exceeded, including bottlenose dolphins, four species of whale and four types of sea turtles. A temporary gillnet closure imposed in 2014 to protect endangered sea turtles in Southern California waters halted fishing operations for a fleet of 16 boats whose annual swordfish and thresher shark catch was then valued at about $1 million on average, a small fraction of California's overall commercial fishery. Milstein said commercial fishermen have adopted new measures to mitigate bycatch, including a device that lowers the top of the gillnet below the water's surface where whales and turtles are likely to swim.

Howell, firing on all cylinders again a couple of weeks after returning from a lengthy spell out with a rib injury, plundered eight birdies in a flawless opening round at TPC Deere Run in Silvis, Illinois. PGA Tour rookie Ollie Schniederjans also carded a 63 for a share in a two-shot lead over fellow Americans Zach Johnson, Chad Campbell and Patrick Rodgers as well as South African Rory Sabbatini, who all shot 65s. Co-leader Howell has an astonishing record of near-misses on tour with 16 runner-up finishes to accompany his two victories. His latest second-placing came two weeks ago at the Quicken Loans National, where he putted so well it  scared  him. That performance came on his return from the injury, which prevented him from practicing anything but his putting.  All I did was putt for nine weeks but you never know if that means success or not,  the 38-year-old told PGATour.com.  That can go one way or the other. My putter and I spent a lot of time together.  While Howell enjoyed benign morning conditions on a course that invariably offers plenty of birdie chances, Schniederjans posted his score in the afternoon and could have had the outright lead but for a bogey at his ninth hole.  Finally got some putts to go in there at the end,  the 24-year-old said after picking up three shots in his final four holes.   I feel sharp at this point,  Schniederjans said.  I took a few weeks off to rest up, get my body back. I had something click last week and I just feel very good about my game and my body right now.

Banco de Mexico Governor Agustin Carstens said talk among private economists that rates would be reduced early next year diverged from the bank's view, which was that it would take some time to consolidate inflation toward its 3 percent target.  He also said Mexico's tight monetary and fiscal policy was good preparation for possible volatility stemming from presidential elections next year and NAFTA negotiations that may start in a few weeks.  Mexico has prepared itself for the months to come,  he said. The Mexican peso MXN=D2 firmed 0.52 percent on Thursday, its sixth straight daily gain, and appreciated after Carstens' comments were published. Carstens told Reuters it was likely the bank would pause a run of seven consecutive base rate hikes at its next policy meeting on Aug. 10, firming up language used in the last monetary policy statement.  That pause may last, but to anticipate that early next year we will start reducing rates, that is running too far ahead. The board has not been discussing that,  he said in an interview at the central bank's Art Deco headquarters in Mexico City.  In its fight to control inflation that is at a more-than  eight-year high, the bank's board raised interest rates a quarter percentage-point to 7.00 percent at last month's meeting, with one member voting to hold them steady. Related CoverageMexico's departing Carstens proud of central bank's increased independenceMexico's Carstens says bond price manipulation not widespreadMonetary policy is at its tightest since early 2009, with 400 basis points of hikes since the end of 2015. Carstens said he believed Mexico was not very far away from a peak in inflation, which the central bank board sees in the second half of the year. He said he expected inflation to fall faster than private economists' forecasts, but said it would take time to consolidate at those levels. Inflation expectations in analysts' polls conducted by the central bank have risen steadily in the past few months, although most see price increases approaching their peak. Lower inflation is expected in January when the statistical impact of fuel price increases wears off.   Capital Economics on Thursday said inflation would peak in a couple of months and forecast cuts in the policy rate at the start of 2018. It said rates would drop to 5.50 percent by year-end 2018. Mexico Governor Agustin Carstens, (R), speaks during an interview with Reuters in Mexico City, Mexico July 13, 2017.Carlos Jasso Where there might be some difference with the market is that where the market might expect us to reduce rates early next year, or during the first six to nine months, I think it is too premature to be making forecasts about what the bank might do,  Carstens said.     Weathering Nafta, Election Carstens, 59, is due to leave the Central Bank in November  to take the top job at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), cutting short a tenure meant to have lasted until 2021. He said he would have liked to have left the bank with inflation below its 3 percent objective, but said he believed the institution was in good shape.  Decisions on what to do with rates will be left to the rest of the bank board and his successor, who has not yet been named. Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade is seen as a strong candidate, although some would like him to run for president.  Slideshow (3 Images)Carstens said high rates and the government's commitment to tight fiscal policy should help the country weather volatility related to presidential elections next year and NAFTA negotiations, which may begin as soon as next month. The current favorite to win the July presidential election is veteran leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has moderated his economic policies in recent years but whose political fortunes still impact the peso. The biggest factors that buffeted the peso this year were an increase in fuel prices and fears that U.S. President Donald Trump would tear up NAFTA earlier, contributing to the spike in inflation.   I think the market conditions have improved dramatically from the beginning of this year,  he said.  The strength of our monetary policy also anchors much better the exchange rate.  Carstens, who earlier warned a Trump presidency would be a horror movie for Mexico and as destructive as a powerful hurricane, said talks about NAFTA had so far been smoother than expected.  If you ask me if my weather forecasting was accurate, I would say no it was not accurate,  he said. He further defended high rates by saying that he did not see the current stance as a major factor in slowing the economy. The central bank forecasts gross domestic product growth of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent in 2017. Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Thursday said it expects the Mexican economy to grow at 1.8 percent in 2017, citing tight fiscal and monetary policies, together with uncertainty over NAFTA, as factors that would further slow growth to 1.3 percent in 2018.

The French-Lebanese trumpet player and composer, making his first appearance since 2006, followed veteran George Benson who performed for the 25th time on the famed Swiss stage. Quincy Jones, producer of Benson's 1980 mega-hit  Give Me The Night  and a former co-director of Montreux, introduced the jazz guitarist and singer who opened at Stravinski Auditorium. Benson, a winner of 10 Grammy Awards, has appeared regularly since 1986, including alongside legend Ray Charles, who died in 2004.

He closed with  Give Me The Night  and  On Broadway , rounded off by a fabulous drum solo by Khari Parker. Maalouf, born in Beirut to musician parents, moved effortlessly between instruments.

U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the sale on Aug. 16 would offer leases offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for exploration and development. The sale will be the first of the administration's 2017-22 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.  Zinke signed an order last week to hold more lease sales and speed up approvals of permits to explore for oil and gas, a process he said got bogged down under former President Barack Obama. Zinke told reporters on Thursday that offshore royalties returned about $18 billion to taxpayers in 2008, before Obama took office, but had dwindled to $2.6 billion last year. He acknowledged that 2008 was an  abnormal year  because of high oil and gas prices, but he said drilling expanded on private lands where developers saw a better return on their investment and fewer regulatory hurdles.  Some of it was oil and gas price, some of it was, the signal was clear: that we're not in the business as a government to deliver on oil and gas,  Zinke said. The Interior Department said it would lower royalty rates for shallow-water leases in the August sale to encourage drilling by oil companies, which have faced lower profits during years of sustained low global crude prices. Energy companies will pay 12.5 percent royalty rates for leases in less than 200 meters (656 feet) of water, instead of a rate of 18.75 percent that had been proposed earlier.    The rate change reflects this Administration's willingness to swiftly respond to economic indicators,  said Vincent DeVito, counselor to Zinke on energy policy.  The 12.5 percent royalty rate is closer in harmony with the current market and federal onshore lease sales,  he said.

The Republican president drew criticism last week from Democrats who accused him of not pressing Putin hard enough at a meeting they held in Germany over Moscow's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Accusations that Moscow meddled in the election and  colluded with the Trump campaign have dominated Trump's first months in office. Russia denies meddling, and Trump says there was no collusion. Trump's comments came as he defended his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he did not know about his son's meeting until recently. But in a conversation with reporters later that day, Trump said that  in fact maybe it (the meeting) was mentioned at some point,  adding he was not told it was about Clinton. Trump has said he wants to work with Moscow on issues like Syria, and told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One to Paris that he was open to the idea of inviting Putin to the White House at some point.  I don’t think this is the right time, but the answer is yes, I would,  when asked if he would extend such an invitation to the Russian leader. The comments were released by the White House on Thursday. 'Did You Do It?' U.S intelligence agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and disseminating false information online.  Trump said in the Reuters interview on Wednesday that he had asked Putin last week if he was involved in Russian interference in the campaign, spending the first 20 or 25 minutes on that issue during a meeting that lasted more than two hours. Russia's President Vladimir Putin talks to U.S. President Donald Trump during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany July 7, 2017.Carlos Barria I said, 'Did you do it?' And he said, 'No, I did not. Absolutely not.' I then asked him a second time in a totally different way. He said absolutely not,  Trump said. Washington this week has been fixated on emails disclosed by Donald Trump Jr., showing him eagerly meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year - the most tangible evidence of a connection between Trump's campaign and Russia, a subject that has also prompted an investigation by a federal special counsel. Trump Jr. was told by an intermediary that the lawyer had information that was part of Moscow's official support for his father's campaign. Trump said in Paris on Thursday that nothing of substance came of the meeting.  My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting. It was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast,  he said at a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump said it was normal in U.S. politics for campaign teams to look into allegations about their opponents, as his son agreed to do before the meeting in June 2016. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican, planned to send a letter on Thursday to the younger Trump to ask him to appear before his committee in a public session, CNN reported. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top-ranking Republican in Congress, urged Trump's son to testify.  I think any witness who's been asked to testify in Congress should do that,  Ryan said.     Watchdog groups filed a complaint against Donald Trump Jr., Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former campaign chief Paul Manafort on Thursday with the Federal Election Commission, which oversees elections, arguing the three violated the law by meeting with the Russian.

Short-term growth prospects remain favorable, and economic policies have been effective in responding to an array of domestic and external pressures in the past year, Fitch said. In a Reuters poll of 65 economists, China's economic growth is expected to reach 6.6 percent this year, topping the government's target of around 6.5 percent. But large and rising debt levels across the non-financial sector, combined with the low stand-alone credit quality of Fitch-rated banks in the financial system, remain the most significant risk factor for the sovereign rating, Fitch said.   In May, Moody's Investors Service cut its sovereign ratings on China by a notch, putting them on par with those of Fitch. That move put Standard & Poor's one step above the two agencies. Moody's had said it expects the financial strength of the world's second-largest economy to erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to mount.  Fitch said it expects official aggregate financing excluding equity to rise to 208 percent of gross domestic product this year versus 201 percent in 2016 and 114 percent in 2008. It estimates that a broader credit measure, which incorporates activity not directly captured in the official series, will rise to around 270 percent at end-2017.  Household debt remains moderate despite its rapid growth in recent years, but China's corporate sector has become the most highly indebted among major economies, based on data from the Bank for International Settlements, Fitch said.  Chinese banks extended 1.54 trillion yuan ($227 billion) in net new yuan loans in June, well above analysts' expectations of 1.2 trillion yuan, and up from 1.11 trillion in May, official data shows.  The stronger-than-expected loans suggest authorities are maintaining support for the real economy, even as they tighten regulations to force banks to deleverage.  But household loans accounted for 48 percent of total new loans in June, down from 55 percent a month earlier. The effects of the government's multi-pronged crackdown are also showing up in weakened off-balance sheet financing, or shadow banking activity. Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted banker's acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking activity, dipped to 428.8 billion yuan in the second quarter from 2.05 trillion yuan in the first three months, according to Reuters calculations.

Something could happen with respect to the Paris accords, let's see what happens,  Trump told a news conference.  If it happens, that will be wonderful, and if it doesn't, that'll be OK too.  Trump has said the Paris accord is soft on leading polluters like China and India, putting U.S. industry at risk.  I respect the wish to preserve jobs, I think that's compatible with the Paris accord,  Macron said at the joint conference.  There is no sudden and unexpected change today, otherwise we would have announced it, but there is the shared intention to continue discussing these issues,  the French president added.  Trump and Macron's relationship got off to a bumpy start, but both have an incentive to improve relations - Macron hopes to elevate France's role in global affairs, and Trump, seemingly isolated among world leaders, needs a friend overseas.

Weeks after Macron hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles, Trump will bask in the trappings of the Bastille Day military parade on Friday and commemorations of the entry 100 years ago of U.S. troops into World War One.  Macron welcomed Trump with a warm handshake and smiles, a contrast to the clenched-jaw greeting they shared at their first encounter in May.

This is so beautiful,  the U.S. president told Macron as they met at the Hotel des Invalides where Napoleon Bonaparte and other French war heroes are buried. Syria Cooperation For the 39-year-old Macron, France's youngest leader since Napoleon two centuries ago, the visit is a chance to use soft diplomacy to win Trump's confidence and set about influencing U.S. foreign policy, which European leaders say lacks direction. Macron views it as counter-productive to isolate the United States on the world stage, and said he and Trump had asked diplomats to draw up in the coming weeks a concrete initiative aimed at preparing the future of Syria.

Trump said work was underway to negotiate a ceasefire in a second region of Syria. On Friday, Trump will be guest of honor at France's July 14 celebrations, a year after a Tunisian man loyal to Islamic State ploughed a truck through revelers on a seafront promenade in Nice, killing more than 80. During the U.S. election campaign, Trump said a wave of militant attacks showed  France is no longer France , and reprimanded the then-Socialist government for allegedly bowing its head to jihadists. In bringing Trump to Paris, Macron has stolen a march on Britain's embattled Prime Minister Theresa May. London's offer of a state visit for Trump met fierce domestic criticism and warnings that he would be greeted by mass protests. An Elabe poll showed that 59 percent of French people approved of Macron's decision to invite Trump.

Short-term growth prospects remain favorable, and economic policies have been effective in responding to an array of domestic and external pressures in the past year, Fitch said. In a Reuters poll of 65 economists, China's economic growth is expected to reach 6.6 percent this year, topping the government's target of around 6.5 percent. But large and rising debt levels across the non-financial sector, combined with the low stand-alone credit quality of Fitch-rated banks in the financial system, remain the most significant risk factor for the sovereign rating, Fitch said.   In May, Moody's Investors Service cut its sovereign ratings on China by a notch, putting them on par with those of Fitch. That move put Standard & Poor's one step above the two agencies. Moody's had said it expects the financial strength of the world's second-largest economy to erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to mount.  Fitch said it expects official aggregate financing excluding equity to rise to 208 percent of gross domestic product this year versus 201 percent in 2016 and 114 percent in 2008. It estimates that a broader credit measure, which incorporates activity not directly captured in the official series, will rise to around 270 percent at end-2017.  Household debt remains moderate despite its rapid growth in recent years, but China's corporate sector has become the most highly indebted among major economies, based on data from the Bank for International Settlements, Fitch said.  Chinese banks extended 1.54 trillion yuan ($227 billion) in net new yuan loans in June, well above analysts' expectations of 1.2 trillion yuan, and up from 1.11 trillion in May, official data shows.  The stronger-than-expected loans suggest authorities are maintaining support for the real economy, even as they tighten regulations to force banks to deleverage.  But household loans accounted for 48 percent of total new loans in June, down from 55 percent a month earlier. The effects of the government's multi-pronged crackdown are also showing up in weakened off-balance sheet financing, or shadow banking activity. Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted banker's acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking activity, dipped to 428.8 billion yuan in the second quarter from 2.05 trillion yuan in the first three months, according to Reuters calculations.

The 20-something tearaways have long been tipped for grand slam glory but, after several years on the tour, the sum total of their achievements is three quarter-finals at the majors. Along the way, they have also paid lots of fines for their bad behavior.   Last week, Tomic was fined $15,000 by the sport's governing body, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), after saying he was  bored  and had faked injury during a listless first-round defeat at Wimbledon. His comments led to him being dropped by his racket sponsor Head. Kyrgios, similarly, has said he struggles to stay motivated and was fined $16,500 by the ATP, which runs the men's Tour,  last October for purposely throwing a game away during his second-round defeat by Mischa Zverev at the Shanghai Masters. Such lack of respect for the sport does not sit well with 82-year-old Rosewall, who did not earn a penny in prize-money when he won his first four grand slam titles during the 1950s when the majors were only open to amateur players.  I feel a lot of us older players, who came from tennis-playing families, we learned to play the game and behave,  Rosewall, who is in London to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Wimbledon Pro event, told Reuters in an interview.   Plus the fact there was more discipline then. When I first came overseas, Harry Hopman was the captain and coach of the team. Our team was made up of players of 17, 18 and 19 years of age and he was like a father figure.   The players of today, because they’ve made more money, they think that they don’t need that discipline, and misbehave accordingly,  Rosewall added as he enjoyed the city's skyline from the ninth floor of his London hotel. Rosewall and his Australian band of brothers - Rod Laver, Fred Stolle and the late Lew Hoad - appreciated the opportunities that playing tennis brought to them. Asked if he felt the behavior of Tomic and Kyrgios reflected badly on the legacy created by his generation, Rosewall said:  That’s pretty accurate. I’d say that.  Really Disappointed FILE PICTURE: Aug 30, 2016; New York, NY, USA; Bernard Tomic of Australia returns a shot to Damir Dzumhur of Bosnia and Herzegovina (not pictured) on day two of the 2016 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Mandatory Credit: Anthony Gruppuso-USA TODAY Sports  / Reuters  Picture Supplied by Action Images Us older Australian players are really disappointed in their actions. It seems like they both couldn’t care less. I don't know,  Rosewall said, shaking his head.  You could probably go to all of the Australian players you can think of that have represented Australia in Davis Cup, we’d all say the same thing.  Kyrgios and Tomic were at loggerheads with Pat Rafter when he was Australia's Davis Cup captain and he ended up axing Tomic from the national squad for the men's team competition. Having shown little respect for their peers, the tournaments they play in, the fans or Tennis Australia, Rosewall felt Tomic's and Kyrgios's families should have pulled them up on their bad-boy antics.  They (Kyrgios and Tomic) both talked to Pat Rafter when he was a bit more involved (as Davis Cup captain) and he got upset because they didn’t seem to be taking any notice or didn’t care,  said the eight-times major champion, who will be in the Royal Box on Friday for the Wimbledon men's semi-finals.   They are not getting any proper support from their family. I would have thought Kyrgios’ family should have said something to him about his behavior.   And the same with Tomic. But he’s had problems with his father, who’s had problems with a lot of other people and it seems to have gone from bad to worse. They’ve self-destructed alright.      The failure of the current crop of players means Australia has not won a men's grand slam title since Lleyton Hewitt triumphed at Wimbledon in 2002, the longest barren run since Norman Brooks claimed their first Wimbledon title in 1907.  Rosewall felt Tomic's behavior was especially disappointing because  a lot of money from Tennis Australia  has been spent on him and he said the player's attitude could backfire.  The other day Tomic said: ‘Well, I’m going to play for another 10 years, then I’ll have enough money and then I can finish’.  With his behavior and not trying, which he has admitted to, no one’s going to want him to play in their tournaments,  Rosewall said.  If you are putting up good prize money as sponsors, they won’t want to take the risk that he’s going to misbehave or won’t try.  Tomic and Kyrgios could not immediately be reached for comment.

Banco de Mexico Governor Agustin Carstens is proud of his accomplishments at the helm of the central bank as he prepares to step down. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Carstens, a former finance minister with blue-chip academic credentials, described himself as the latest in a line of governors bolstering the autonomy of Mexico's central bank. The 59-year-old Carstens, who is highly respected on Wall Street, will leave in December to take the top job at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). He said he was cutting short a tenure meant to have lasted through 2021 because opportunities such as the one at BIS only come up occasionally. After he took over in 2010, Banco de Mexico began publishing minutes of monthly monetary policy meetings, and Carstens increased the quality and flow of data and analysis about Latin America's No. 2 economy.  That has brought Banco de Mexico to be one of the strongest central banks, needless to say among emerging markets, but also in general, considering advanced economies' central banks,  Carstens said. Carstens' much-praised governorship is ending with a bumpy ride. On his watch, annualized inflation surged to 6.31 percent in June, way past the central bank's 3 percent target and the highest level since December 2008. Largely to blame was a slump in the peso currency following U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise election in November and a surge in gasoline prices after President Enrique Pena Nieto this year began to remove government subsidies. Carstens said he was disappointed to be leaving the job with inflation high.  Of course I would have loved to have it on the record in my period that we had consolidated strongly the 3 percent objective,  said Carstens, who has headed the central bank for eight years.  However, he said the liberalization of fuel prices would be positive for the economy in the long run.  If you take it way, because it is not a generalized increase in prices, we are not that far way from our target,  he said.   The peso currency MXN=D2 weakened more than 1 percent against the dollar last Dec. 1 when Carstens' plan to leave the bank was announced, surprising investors and raising concerns about who might replace him. It slumped further, to record lows, after Trump took office, but has since recovered.  In an effort to beat back prices, Carstens and the bank's other board members have hiked interest rates for seven straight monetary policy meetings. The benchmark rate now stands at 7.00 percent, the highest level since 2009. Carstens said criticism of current inflation rates shows just how much the central bank has improved in recent decades from the mid 1990s when inflation hit nearly 52 percent.   When the Banco de Mexico became independent more than 20 years ago, (current levels) of inflation were considered acceptable, even extremely good. Today, Mexican society considers 6.3 percent inflation as excessive and undesirable, and it should be that way,  he said.      Carstens, who earned a doctorate in economics in 1985 from the University of Chicago, served two stints at the International Monetary Fund, including as deputy managing director, and unsuccessfully sought the job of IMF head in 2011, losing out to France's Christine Lagarde. Pena Nieto has not announced who will replace him. Writing by Noel Randewich; Editing by Leslie Adler","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-cenbank-legacy-idUSKBN19Z03K"},

Quincy Jones, producer of Benson's 1980 mega-hit  Give Me The Night  and a former co-director of Montreux, introduced the jazz guitarist and singer who opened at Stravinski Auditorium. Benson, a winner of 10 Grammy Awards, has appeared regularly since 1986, including alongside legend Ray Charles, who died in 2004.

He closed with  Give Me The Night  and  On Broadway , rounded off by a fabulous drum solo by Khari Parker. Maalouf, born in Beirut to musician parents, moved effortlessly between instruments.

Peru thanked Ecuador for the gesture on Thursday, which came after the neighboring countries' foreign affairs ministers met in Lima. It said on Twitter they would talk later this month about the short section of wall besides a canal that divides the two countries. Peru's ambassador to Ecuador will also return to Quito, the ministry added. Ecuador's foreign affairs ministry confirmed the suspension of work on the wall near the town of Huaquillas, which is part of a $4.4 billion urban planning project started by the government of Ecuador's former President Rafael Correa. The diplomatic row marked a rough start to bilateral relations under Peruvian centrist President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Ecuador's socialist President Lenin Moreno, both of whom took office in the past year. In the 1990s, territorial disputes led to a three-year war between the two countries that share a 1,529-kilometer (950-mile) border. Peru has said that construction of the concrete wall violates the countries' 1998 peace treaty because it comes too close to a canal in populated areas near the Zarumilla River along their shared border. Ecuador has said the wall would help control flooding that affects border towns every year, but Peru says it could disrupt the flow of water in the canal and raise flood risks for Peruvians. The two countries are prone to severe flooding when the El Nino weather pattern warms sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific. Earlier this year, heavy rains from a local El Nino phenomenon killed more than 150 people in Peru. Correa, who backed Lenin in this year's tight presidential election, criticized Ecuador's move to suspend work on the wall and said Peru should focus on preventing flooding on its side of the border.

Now, some of these producers are turning to creative investments to pump more oil.  Drilling joint ventures, called  DrillCos  for short, combine cash from investors like Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) with drillable-but-idle land already owned by producers. Investors get a pledge of double-digit returns within a few years, while producers can raise productivity without spending more of their own money. The total raised by these ventures - at least $2 billion in the last 24 months - is a small part of overall shale financing. But they represent another way for Wall Street and shale producers to increase the flow of oil, and frustrate plans by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to prop up prices. Private equity this year has showered more than $20 billion on U.S. energy ventures. Driven by shale expansion, U.S. oil production this year is forecast to increase by 570,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.9 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates.  No Balance-Sheet Risk Drillcos take control of drillable land and generally turn over 100 percent of the cash flow from oil and gas production to investors until they earn a 15 percent return. At that point, control reverts to the producer, with the investor's stake shrinking to about 10 percent of remaining production.   It's a type of surgical, temporary capital,  Mark Stoner a partner at private equity fund Bayou City Energy LP, said in an interview. Bayou City committed $256 million to an Oklahoma drillco with privately held Alta Mesa Holdings LP [ALMEH.UL] last year.  We get exposure to great, prolific oil basins, but don't have to take on balance sheet risk.   Companies such as EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N), one of the financially strongest U.S. shale producers, are turning to drillcos.  Two months ago, EOG struck a $400 million deal with Carlyle to finance wells in Oklahoma. The investment lets EOG focus its own cash on the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, and lifts its production without increasing its spending. The venture also allows EOG to double or triple the value of land it held on its books, Lloyd Helms, EOG's head of exploration and production, said an industry conference in May. Legacy Reserves LP (LGCY.O), Exco Resources Inc (XCO.N), Alta Mesa and EOG are among 34 oil producers that since 2015 have formed drillcos worth more than $2.05 billion. The money has come from investors including Blackstone Group (BX.N), Carlyle, KKR & Co (KKR.N), and others, according to 1Derrick Ltd, which tracks oilfield land deals.  Putting Idle Land to Use Historically, one way producers wrung more cash from financiers was to pledge future output for cash payments to finance drilling. There was no swap of land and no guaranteed return. Drillcos differ in that investors get control of land until a double-digit rate of return is met, providing insurance against a default.  For producers, these ventures also help boost the total amount of oil they can eventually recover. Wall Street is rewarding those with strong production with share price gains at a time when OPEC and its allies have agreed to pull 1.8 million bpd off the global market.  This helped us drill acreage that we wouldn't otherwise have been able to drill right away,  Mike McCabe, Alta Mesa's chief financial officer, said in an interview.  For investors, the potentially high rates of return, compared with commercial loan rates running about 5 percent to 7 percent, have spurred interest despite crude prices CLc1 under $50 a barrel.   There's a lot of money seeking a home, especially in this low interest rate environment,  Mingda Zhao of Vinson & Elkins LLP, a law firm that has negotiated drillco agreements, said in an interview. Drillcos are not risk free. If oil prices tumble, investors' ability to grab high returns within a few years fades. Shale  producers also must be willing to provide more information on the land than they would under more common loan agreements.  Such detailed information  gives us well-level insight into what's going on in a basin,  said Bayou City's Stoner. For Carlyle, one of the world's largest private equity funds, the drillco with EOG was a relatively low-risk way to invest in U.S. shale.  We were looking for very specific types of assets and drilling deals to make the risk-return work for us,  David Albert, co-head of Carlyle's Energy Mezzanine Opportunities funds, said in an interview.  The funds, with more than $4 billion under management, can still make money on its drillco investment even after oil prices CLc1 slipped below $45 per barrel this month on oversupply concerns.      Even with current oil prices, there are still economic opportunities to be had out there,  Albert said.

Banco de Mexico Governor Agustin Carstens is proud of his accomplishments at the helm of the central bank as he prepares to step down. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Carstens, a former finance minister with blue-chip academic credentials, described himself as the latest in a line of governors bolstering the autonomy of Mexico's central bank. The 59-year-old Carstens, who is highly respected on Wall Street, will leave in December to take the top job at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). He said he was cutting short a tenure meant to have lasted through 2021 because opportunities such as the one at BIS only come up occasionally. After he took over in 2010, Banco de Mexico began publishing minutes of monthly monetary policy meetings, and Carstens increased the quality and flow of data and analysis about Latin America's No. 2 economy.  That has brought Banco de Mexico to be one of the strongest central banks, needless to say among emerging markets, but also in general, considering advanced economies' central banks,  Carstens said. Carstens' much-praised governorship is ending with a bumpy ride. On his watch, annualized inflation surged to 6.31 percent in June, way past the central bank's 3 percent target and the highest level since December 2008. Largely to blame was a slump in the peso currency following U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise election in November and a surge in gasoline prices after President Enrique Pena Nieto this year began to remove government subsidies. Carstens said he was disappointed to be leaving the job with inflation high.  Of course I would have loved to have it on the record in my period that we had consolidated strongly the 3 percent objective,  said Carstens, who has headed the central bank for eight years. However, he said the liberalization of fuel prices would be positive for the economy in the long run.  If you take it way, because it is not a generalized increase in prices, we are not that far way from our target,  he said. The peso currency weakened more than 1 percent against the dollar last Dec. 1 when Carstens' plan to leave the bank was announced, surprising investors and raising concerns about who might replace him. It slumped further, to record lows, after Trump took office, but has since recovered. In an effort to beat back prices, Carstens and the bank's other board members have hiked interest rates for seven straight monetary policy meetings. The benchmark rate now stands at 7.00 percent, the highest level since 2009. Carstens said criticism of current inflation rates shows just how much the central bank has improved in recent decades from the mid 1990s when inflation hit nearly 52 percent.  When the Banco de Mexico became independent more than 20 years ago, (current levels) of inflation were considered acceptable, even extremely good. Today, Mexican society considers 6.3 percent inflation as excessive and undesirable, and it should be that way,  he said. Carstens, who earned a doctorate in economics in 1985 from the University of Chicago, served two stints at the International Monetary Fund, including as deputy managing director, and unsuccessfully sought the job of IMF head in 2011, losing out to France's Christine Lagarde. Pena Nieto has not announced who will replace him. (Writing by Noel Randewich; Editing by Leslie Adler)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-cenbank-legacy-idUSL1N1K420T"},

The Warrick smelter in Indiana has annual capacity of 269,000 tonnes, its own coal-based power source and is integrated with a rolling mill.  None of which saved it from Alcoa's scramble down the cost curve in the face of falling prices, culminating in its permanent closure in January 2016.  That's different from what the industry calls a  curtailment , a temporary idling for possible restart.  But now, miraculously, Warrick is back and Alcoa will fire up three of the plant's five production lines, with capacity of 161,400 tonnes of aluminum. The other two will be classified as  curtailed . The timing of this resurrection is politically charged.  The Trump administration is determined to curb imports of aluminum, along with steel, with the aid of some heavy national security artillery. The results of both so-called Section 232 investigations are pending. And Alcoa, for one,  appreciates the actions the Trump administration has taken to address the challenges faced by the U.S. aluminum industry, including Chinese overcapacity .  The United States had 23 operating plants in 1998. It now has five, soon to be become six. There is a little more than a million tonnes of capacity lying idled, ready for restart if the conditions are right.  However, most of the lost smelters are long past the point of resurrection, with plants dismantled and sites reclaimed. China, with its massive aluminum sector and equally massive exports, stands accused, but the real smelter killers were much closer to home.   Price and Power Alcoa's change of mind is in part down to the aluminum price, which has risen from below $1,500 a tonne in January 2016 to more than $1,900 today. It has done so, ironically, on the promise of Chinese capacity cuts.  But there is also a power supply dimension, Alcoa noting an agreement with local utility Vectren to operate one of the four on-site power generation units through 2023.  This, Alcoa says,  provides important clarity for the power portfolio at Warrick , albeit without providing a lot of clarity for the rest of us.  The key point, however, is that there is always a power dimension in the mix when aluminum smelters close or restart. They use a lot of it and profitability is determined primarily by the interaction of power and aluminum prices.  West Coast Killer It was the breakdown in that relationship in 2000-01 that dealt the killer blow for the 10 smelters feeding off the power generated by hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.  One of the more interesting submissions to the Section 232 hearings on aluminum imports came from Tim Belden of EnergyGPS Consulting. Belden used the events of 2000-01 to underline the importance of power availability and price in determining smelter viability.  Those were the years now known as the Western U.S. Energy Crisis, when California was hit by blackouts and wholesale power prices went supernova. The price rises, Belden says, were  of a magnitude and duration that had never been seen before or since in any North American power market . All ten aluminum smelters closed. Five never restarted. Two tried and failed. Only one, Alcoa's Intalco plant in Washington, is currently producing aluminum, albeit after multiple near-death experiences.  The West Coast power crisis was caused by a toxic combination of too little generation capacity, a chaotic pricing model and the machinations of traders who manipulated the flawed system.  So, if you want to know who killed the northwest aluminum smelters, it was Enron.  That flawed company was at the front of the line for official sanction. In June 2003 it was stripped by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of some of its power and gas trading rights for its role in the crisis.  Financial Killer While Enron killed the West Coast smelters in 2000, bankers killed another batch a decade later. The global financial crisis brought a collapse in aluminum demand as the U.S. automotive industry went into meltdown. Prices slumped and London-traded aluminum hit a low of $1,279 a tonne early in 2009.  By the end of that year another four plants had halted production: Alcoa's smelters in Texas and Tennessee, Century Aluminum's Ravenswood smelter in West Virginia and Glencore's Columbia Falls smelter in Montana. The latter was a survivor of the earlier power crisis.  Another, Ormet's Hannibal plant in Ohio, limped on but never fully recovered and gave up the ghost in 2012. Made in the u.s., Powered in the u.s.  It's the remaining nine plants, three of them still inactive, that are now fighting for survival against what is the relatively new threat of Chinese overproduction.  While China doesn't export aluminum in commodity form, it ships out a lot of semi-manufactured products, which displace demand for the rest of the world's producers, not least in the United States.  That could change if the Section 232 investigation results in import quotas or tariffs.  How much of the battered U.S. smelter sector could be brought out of mothballs?  Alcoa and Century between them are running only two of their combined five operating smelters at capacity. Including the two lines on standby at Warrick, idled capacity at active plants is about 420,000 tonnes.  There is another 640,000 tonnes of capacity at three inactive plants.  The New Madrid smelter in Missouri was last year bought out of bankruptcy by Swiss-based ARG International AG, led by former Glencore trader Matt Lucke, with the aim of restarting the 263,000 tonne a year plant.  Alcoa has idled capacity at Wenatchee in Washington, another  Enron survivor , and at Rockdale in Texas. Yes, the same Texas smelter that shut up shop in 2008. Alcoa closed permanently two of its six lines in 2012 but four, with capacity of 191,000 tonnes, are still primed for restart.  Old smelters, it seems, can sleep for a long time. But to awaken, they need the right power price as much as the right aluminum price.  And it is  competitive power  that will determine the extent of any U.S. aluminum smelter revival.  That is why Alcoa has been able to bring back Warrick.   We were pleased to play an important role in helping make this a reality,  said Carl Chapman, chairman, president and CEO of power utility Vectren. It will likely determine ARG's success in bringing back to life what has been renamed that Magnitude 7 Metals smelter.  Missouri lawmakers passed a bill in May, freeing up utilities to enter longer-term, lower-priced supply contracts, offering the plant a potential lifeline.  The Trump administration wants more aluminum to be made in the United States, and import tariffs would tilt the playing field in that direction.  But when it comes to aluminum,  made in the America  needs to be powered in America -- and that's down to local utilities, not national policy.

The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2tM4mAO * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2thOpza * Chart 3: tmsnrt.rs/2thBJYM By John Kemp LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is trying to support oil prices by reducing its crude shipments to the United States in a bid to cut the amount of oil in commercial storage. U.S. crude imports from Saudi Arabia averaged less than 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the four weeks ending on July 7, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia are running at the slowest rate since 2015, and the slowest for the time of year for over five years (tmsnrt.rs/2tM4mAO and tmsnrt.rs/2thOpza). Imports from Saudi Arabia will fall even further to less than 800,000 bpd in August, according to a Saudi industry source familiar with the kingdom's oil policy.  Saudi Arabia is keen to see an improvement in the oil market and accelerate the balancing process,  the source told Reuters on Wednesday ( Saudis to cut August oil exports to lowest level this year , Reuters, July 12). Saudi Arabia is cutting exports to all destinations but reducing shipments to the United States is especially important because U.S. stocks are the most visible and have the biggest impact on prices. The United States accounts for more than 40 percent of the commercial crude and product stocks held in the OECD and its stocks are reported weekly rather than monthly as in most other countries. U.S. crude and product stocks therefore receive disproportionate attention from oil traders and analysts, and can have a major impact on global oil prices. Changes in U.S. crude and products stocks are often (misleadingly) interpreted to reflect changes in the global supply-demand balance. Saudi Arabia is the largest supplier of crude oil to the United States after Canada, providing an average of 1.1 million bpd to U.S. refiners in 2016. By restricting shipments, Saudi Arabia hopes to reduce U.S. stocks and demonstrate to sceptical traders that the long-awaited rebalancing of the global market is finally underway. The strategy seems to have had some early success with U.S. crude stocks falling earlier and faster than normal so far in the second and third quarters of 2017. U.S. crude stocks have fallen by 40 million barrels since the end of March, compared with a drawdown of just 8 million barrels over the same period in 2016. U.S. crude stocks are now just 3 million barrels higher than at the same point in 2016, compared with 35 million barrels higher at the end of March. Most of the drawdown in crude stocks is attributable to record refinery runs but slower imports likely played an important supporting role. Senior officials from Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC are hoping U.S. stocks will continue to decline rapidly through the rest of the summer driving season. Saudi Arabia plans to use big stock draws to convince the oil market that rebalancing is happening and oil prices and calendar spreads need to rise. The strategy has a fair chance of success but it could be threatened by rising U.S. imports from other OPEC and non-OPEC members or a diversion of Saudi shipments from the United States to other markets. While Saudi Arabia's crude shipments to the United States have fallen, Iraq's shipments have risen to their highest seasonal level in almost five years (tmsnrt.rs/2thBJYM). The International Energy Agency reports compliance with OPEC's production agreement declined sharply in June to its lowest level in six months ( Oil Market Report , IEA, July 2017). OPEC output rose from Nigeria and Libya, which are not capped by the agreement, and as a result of weakening compliance among other members. Some of this extra crude could end up refilling U.S. storage tanks, which would undercut Saudi efforts to drain them. Oil traders will also be alert for any signs crude shipments are being diverted causing stocks to grow in other less visible locations. Beyond August, there are questions about what happens to shipments and stocks when the U.S. driving season finishes and Saudi Arabia and Iraq start burning less crude as the summer air-conditioning season winds down. For now, though, OPEC hopes traders will interpret a sustained draw in U.S. crude stocks as a sign the market is rebalancing and that prices need to move higher.

The total value of the combined soybean and meat deals was set at $5.012 billion by the U.S. Soybean Export Council. The beef deal came just weeks after China reopened its market to U.S. supplies after a 14-year ban. But traders and analysts said the agreements from the world's top buyer of soybeans provided little insight for the market, as final prices and shipment dates were not specified. The agreements added up to the second-largest on record between the two countries.  They are meaningless,  said Charlie Sernatinger, global head of grain futures at ED&F; Man Capital.  It is window dressing.  The deals were signed as frame contracts, which are typically non-binding letters of intent to buy at a later date, without formal sales terms. Terry Branstad, the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to China, had said that serving U.S. beef in the embassy was a goal of his. Agriculture trade has been a bright spot in U.S.-China relations since Trump's inauguration, unlike other areas.  Trump said on Thursday he was considering using quotas and tariffs to deal with the  big problem  of steel dumping from China and other countries.  Agriculture groups have raised concerns that countries seeking to retaliate against U.S.-imposed trade restrictions will target commodities such as soybeans and corn that U.S. farmers produce a surplus of.  I think that is something that we should always be concerned about and thinking about,  said Jim Sutter, chief executive officer of the U.S. Soybean Export Council.  But I think agricultural trade hopefully will continue to be that stabilizing force.  The record for a soybean frame contract was for 13.18 million tonnes signed in 2015. A year ago, Chinese buyers agreed to buy 4 million tonnes of soybeans. The market shrugged off the news, which hit late in the trading day.  I wouldn't read anything into this,  said a U.S. soybean export trader who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak with media.  It's photos and shaking hands. To me, contracts have dates and prices.   The benchmark Chicago Board of Trade November soybean futures contract settled down 46-1/2 cents at $9.87-1/2 a bushel, just a penny above its session low. The 4.5 percent daily loss was the biggest for soybeans since July 7, 2016. Thursday's deals likely will not impact China's import volume from the United States as importers will continue to buy based on need and price, said the export trader, who has attended signing agreements in the past. Still, the gatherings bring together buyers and sellers, which builds business ties and can lead to future export agreements, he added.  The U.S. Agriculture Department expects China to import 93 million tonnes of soybeans in the 2017/18 marketing year, up from 89 million in 2016/17. Total U.S. soybean exports are pegged at 58.51 million tonnes, up from 55.79 million tonnes a year earlier.

OPEC's compliance with cuts slumped to 78 percent last month from 95 percent in May as higher-than-allowed output from Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Iraq, the UAE and Venezuela offset strong compliance from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Angola.  Each month something seems to come along to raise doubts about the pace of the rebalancing process. This month, there are two hitches: a dramatic recovery in oil production from Libya and Nigeria and a lower rate of compliance by OPEC with its own output agreement,  the Paris-based IEA said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-OPEC producers including Russia have agreed to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018 to ease a global crude glut spurred by booming U.S. output.  OPEC members Libya and Nigeria were exempted from the cuts due to years of unrest that have sapped their output. The two countries have managed to increase their combined production by more than 700,000 bpd in recent months, the IEA said.  For fellow OPEC members, who agreed to reduce production by 1.2 million bpd, to see their cut effectively diluted by nearly two-thirds must be very frustrating, especially as their pact has, hitherto, been well observed by historical standards,  the IEA said.  The cuts have stabilized oil at around $45-50 per barrel, but prices have come under renewed pressure in recent weeks due to growing U.S. output and little evidence of global stocks falling from record highs above 3 billion barrels. The IEA, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said strong demand growth in the second half of 2017 and in 2018 should nevertheless speed up market rebalancing. It said demand for OPEC's crude was forecast to rise steadily through 2017 and reach 33.6 million bpd in the fourth quarter - up 1 million bpd on OPEC's June output.   Provided there is strong compliance with OPEC's cuts, that would imply a hefty stock draw, even if Libya and Nigeria recover further,  it said. The IEA said stocks in industrialized nations in May were 266 million barrels above the five-year average, down from 300 million barrels in April. Preliminary data shows a further moderate reduction in stocks for June. The agency also said that while non-OPEC producers such as the United States, Canada and Brazil were firmly back in growth mode, the recent decline in oil prices could force some U.S. producers to reassess their prospects.   Financial data suggests that while output might be gushing, profits are not and recent press reports quoted leading company executives saying that oil prices need to be around $50 per barrel to maintain production growth,  the IEA said.

Trump,John McCain,Lindsey Graham,Lisa Murkowski,Mike Pence,Mitch McConnell,Rand Paul,Rick Pollack,ROB PORTMAN,Shelley Moore Capito,Susan Collins,Ted Cruz,USA,HEALTHCARE/,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republican leaders released on Thursday a revised plan to dismantle the Obamacare law, but it drew criticism from senators on both sides of the political divide within the Republican party, indicating a treacherous path for the bill. The bill played to the party's disparate factions by letting insurers sell cheap, bare-bones policies while retaining taxes on the wealthy. But the immediate outcry illustrated the difficult political terrain that U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must navigate. He is under pressure by President Donald Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans' seven-year mission to gut Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement.  The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare. They deserve better care. And the time to deliver that to them is next week,  McConnell said. In addition to the criticism from some senators, a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas. With Democrats united against it, McConnell cannot afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage. But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate. Several senators said they had concerns about the legislation, particularly its Medicaid cuts, including Shelley Moore Capito, Rob Portman and John McCain. And two other Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan. McConnell, a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party, has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week. The continuing lack of consensus among Republicans on what to do with Obamacare after calling for its demise since 2010 shows that it is no sure thing that Trump's party will be able to get the job done. Healthcare is Trump's first major legislative initiative. Failure would call into question his party's ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House.  Skinny Plans  The measure represents a retreat from long-standing Republican aspirations to dump Obamacare-related taxes. It retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed, and also keeps Obamacare's limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry. The bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped-down, low-cost healthcare plans - a measure proposed by Senator Ted Cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives. These  skinny plans  would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under Obamacare like maternity and newborn care, mental health services and addiction treatment, outpatient care, hospitalization, emergency room visits and prescription drugs. Insurer groups, including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, have derided the skinny plans, saying they would raise insurance premiums, destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions. Moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons. The new bill provides an additional $70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the $112 billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses. The bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, and includes sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025. Moderate Republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version. Critics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators, the revised bill's core remains unchanged: restructuring and cutting the critical Medicaid social safety-net program, taking away insurance from millions of Americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable Americans, especially older people and the sick. The revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a moderate who had opposed the original bill. It would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums – at least 75 percent above the national average. Alaska is the only state with premiums that high, Senate aides said.  Unacceptable Flaws  Hospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the Senate Republican approach, particularly proposed Medicaid cuts. The cuts would result in lower revenues for hospital companies like Community Health Systems Inc and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare and Centene Corp . Molina Healthcare, which has more than 1 million customers on the Obamacare individual exchanges and manages Medicaid health programs, said the changes would leave insurers competing for the least risky customers and would make plans for sick people unaffordable. The American Hospital Association said the new version of the bill retained the  unacceptable flaws  of the previous version.  Instead of merely putting forth an update, we again call on the Senate to put forth an upgrade,  Rick Pollack, president of the association, said in a statement. Healthcare stocks were mostly unmoved by the announcement, as Wall Street analysts described the core of the revised bill as largely unchanged from the earlier one. The new bill includes another $45 billion for fighting the opioid addiction epidemic, on top of the $2 billion in the earlier version. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which forecast that the previous version would have increased the number of Americans without health insurance by 22 million by 2026, is due to evaluate the new bill in coming days. The Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people, in large part by expanding Medicaid. The House of Representatives on May 4 passed its own version of healthcare legislation. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority, with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a potential tie-breaking vote. Any bill passed by the Senate would have to go back to the House for approval. Repealing and replacing Obamacare, which Republicans fault as a costly government intrusion into the healthcare system, was a top campaign promise for Trump, who was monitoring the Senate developments during his visit to Paris.  I'd say the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians is healthcare,  Trump told reporters on his flight to Paris.

In a Reuters poll of 65 economists, China's economic growth is expected to reach 6.6 percent this year, topping the government's target of around 6.5 percent. But large and rising debt levels across the non-financial sector, combined with the low stand-alone credit quality of Fitch-rated banks in the financial system, remain the most significant risk factor for the sovereign rating, Fitch said. In May, Moody's Investors Service cut its sovereign ratings on China by a notch, putting them on par with those of Fitch. That move put Standard & Poor's one step above the two agencies.

The U.S. currency's recent advance, notably against the yen, has stalled towards the end of this week as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen curbed some of the monetary tightening expectations that had supported the greenback. Signs of a pickup in U.S. inflation could reinforce views that the Fed would hike interest rates again sooner rather than later, which would lift Treasury yields and the dollar. However, the core consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to have risen only 1.7 percent year-on-year in June after a similar gain in May. On a month-on-month basis, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent gain the previous month.  After their June rate hike, the Fed is seen watching inflation trends carefully before tightening policy again. So market interest towards inflation data is very high and the dollar is likely to move widely in either direction,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was flat at 95.766, poised to end the week 0.25 percent lower. The greenback was a shade higher at 113.425 yen but still some distance away from a four-month peak of 114.495 struck on Tuesday. The euro was flat at $1.1403, unable to draw much lift even as Germany's 10-year bund yield climbed back above the 0.50 percent threshold overnight on a report that the European Central Bank is likely to signal in September that its asset purchase programme will be gradually wound down next year.  The euro has become top heavy over the past few days with participants unwinding some of the bloated long positions built up recently. But the euro is still likely to begin probing highs again on speculation that the ECB would begin normalising policy,  Yamamoto at Mizuho Securities said. The common currency had set a 14-month high of $1.1489 on Wednesday on views that the ECB would begin reversing its very easy monetary policy sooner rather than later. The Australian dollar touched a four-month peak of $0.7746 . The Aussie was on track to rise 1.7 percent on the week, lifted by an improvement in broader investor risk appetite and rise in prices of commodities, notably iron ore.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. Mourning his death, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Liu was a  courageous fighter for civil rights and freedom of expression , while the French, British and U.S. governments called on China to allow Liu's family to move around freely. Already seriously ill, Liu, a thorn in the ruling Communist Party's side since he helped negotiate a deal to allow protesters to leave Tiananmen Square before troops and tanks rolled in, was moved last month from prison to a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang. The Shenyang Bureau of Justice said in a brief statement on its website that Liu had suffered multiple organ failure and efforts to save him had failed. Though allowed out on medical parole he was never freed, spending his final days in the hospital surrounded by security guards. Teng Yue'e, the chief doctor treating Liu, told a news conference in a nearby hotel that Liu died at 5:35 PM (0935 GMT) surrounded by his family.  When Mr. Liu Xiaobo died, he was not in any pain at that moment, he was very much at peace, because all of his relatives said their goodbyes beforehand. So when we saw him we thought he was very much at peace,  Teng said. The leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee which, to Beijing's ire, awarded Liu the peace prize in 2010, said the Chinese government bore a heavy responsibility for his death.  We find it deeply disturbing that Liu Xiaobo was not transferred to a facility where he could receive adequate medical treatment before he became terminally ill,  said Berit Reiss-Andersen in an emailed statement. China said at the time that Liu's award was an  obscenity  that should not have gone to a man it called a criminal and a subversive. Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist who died in 1938 in Nazi Germany's Berlin, was the last Nobel Peace Prize winner to live out his dying days under state surveillance. Reform Call Related CoverageChina should allow Liu's wife to travel abroad, German minister saysWest mourns Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, criticizes BeijingU.N. chief 'deeply saddened' by Chinese dissident's deathWestern governments criticized Beijing for not allowing him to seek treatment for his cancer overseas and called on China to loosen its restrictions on dissent.  China has lost a deeply principled role model who deserved our respect and adulation, not the prison sentences to which he was subjected,  said U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad. Tsai Ing-wen, the president of self-ruled Taiwan which China regards as a wayward province, said on her Facebook page the island hoped China could now show self-confidence and promote political reform.  Only through democracy, in which every Chinese person has freedom and respect, can China truly become a proud and important country,  she said. In China, while mention of Liu's passing was swiftly removed from Weibo, the country's answer to Twitter, images and comments were shared on the WeChat messaging service. Some activists shared a picture of a black screen with the years 1955-2017 - his lifespan - or of a single candle superimposed over his face.  Mr. Liu, rest in peace,  wrote rights lawyer Zhang Peihong on his WeChat account. Pro-democracy activists mourn the death of Chinese Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 13, 2017.Bobby YipState news agency Xinhua reported the death only in English in a brief story that noted he had been seen by  China's top-rated cancer experts . State-run tabloid the Global Times said in an English-language editorial on its website early Friday morning that Liu's last days were politicized by overseas forces.   They used Liu's illness as a tool to boost their image and demonize China,  it said.  While Chinese doctors were doing their best to save Liu, they clamored and asked the critically ill patient to be transferred abroad only to show their so-called 'sympathy'.  Freedom of Movement        United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein urged China to guarantee his widow, Liu Xia, freedom of movement, and allow her to travel abroad should she want to. Liu Xia has lived under house arrest since 2010.  Despite the imprisonment and separation from the wife he adored that could have fueled anger and bitterness, Liu Xiaobo declared that he had no hatred for those who pursued and prosecuted him,  Zeid said.    Slideshow (16 Images)Rights groups and Western governments had urged China to allow Liu and his wife to leave the country to be treated abroad, as Liu had said he wanted. But the government said Liu was being treated by renowned Chinese cancer experts and the hospital said he was too sick to travel. Beijing did allow two foreign doctors, from the United States and Germany, to visit Liu on Saturday. They later said they considered it was safe for him to be moved overseas. Family friend and fellow dissident Hu Jia said the authorities would not let him die in peace.  To some extent, this was an attempt by the Party to show their strength, to show that they control your life if you live in China,  he told Reuters.   But I think the historic message they are leaving is very different. By letting a Nobel peace prize winner die in custody they lost a chance to show humanity and instead proved their cold-blooded nature.  In the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, which enjoys broad freedoms not granted in mainland China, around 100 protesters gathered in silence outside Beijing's representative office, some quietly sobbing and others with their heads.  Many held signs reading  The people's hero, he'll always be remembered,   the murder of a dissident  and  free Liu Xia . A White House statement on Thursday said President Donald Trump was  deeply saddened  to learn of Liu's death.       At an earlier news conference during a visit to Paris, Trump made no mention of Liu when asked about the U.S.-China relationship, but instead chose to praise Chinese President Xi Jinping as a “great leader,” a “very talented man” and a “very good man.”  “President Xi is a terrific guy. I like being with him a lot. And he’s a very special person,” Trump said.  Earlier on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Liu’s death “tragic” and called on China to free his widow. A White House official said on Wednesday that Trump raised Liu's case in a July 2 telephone call with Xi, while the U.S. national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, raised it with his Chinese counterpart at the G20 meeting last week. Additional reporting by Christian Shepherd, and James Pomfret and Venus Wu in Hong Kong, J.R.

However, a heavy snow warning remained in place for some parts of the small South Pacific island nation, which was hit by a cyclone in April that killed one person. Heavy rain and snow caused flight cancellations, road closures and power outages on Thursday, with winds in the capital, Wellington, reaching up to 160 km an hour (100 mph).  The strong cold southerly flow over the North Island is forecast to gradually ease today,  New Zealand's meteorological service said on its website.  However, further snow is expected about the Central Plateau and ranges of Hawke's Bay until late this afternoon ... this additional snow is likely to cause continuing disruption to transport about the central North Island high country,  it said. Officials from Wellington airport said on Twitter flights had resumed, although delays were expected due to the backlog of flights that had been cancelled on Thursday. Most ferry services across the Cook Strait between the North and South Islands had also resumed. Thousands of homes remained without power and major roads in the North Island were still closed, New Zealand media reported. A group of 20 motorists trapped on one highway broke into a house to seek shelter on Thursday, according to media reports.

The bill played to the party's disparate factions by letting insurers sell cheap, bare-bones policies while retaining taxes on the wealthy.  But the immediate outcry illustrated the difficult political terrain that U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must navigate. He is under pressure by President Donald Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans' seven-year mission to gut Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement.  The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare. They deserve better care. And the time to deliver that to them is next week,  McConnell said. In addition to the criticism from some senators, a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas. With Democrats united against it, McConnell cannot afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage. But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate. Several senators said they had concerns about the legislation, particularly its Medicaid cuts, including Shelley Moore Capito, Rob Portman and John McCain. And two other Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan. McConnell, a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party, has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week. The continuing lack of consensus among Republicans on what to do with Obamacare after calling for its demise since 2010 shows that it is no sure thing that Trump's party will be able to get the job done. Healthcare is Trump's first major legislative initiative. Failure would call into question his party's ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House.  Skinny Plans  Related CoverageFactbox: Senate healthcare bill would slash Medicaid, keep taxes on wealthySenate Republican leaders release revised version of healthcare billU.S. House will delay break if Senate passes health bill: House speakerThe measure represents a retreat from long-standing Republican aspirations to dump Obamacare-related taxes. It retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed, and also keeps Obamacare's limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry. The bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped-down, low-cost healthcare plans - a measure proposed by Senator Ted Cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives. These  skinny plans  would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under Obamacare like maternity and newborn care, mental health services and addiction treatment, outpatient care, hospitalization, emergency room visits and prescription drugs. Insurer groups, including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, have derided the skinny plans, saying they would raise insurance premiums, destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions. Moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons. The new bill provides an additional $70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the $112 billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) (C) is surrounded by reporters as he arrives for a meeting of the Senate Republican caucus for an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. July 13, 2017.Jonathan ErnstThe bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, and includes sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025. Moderate Republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version. Critics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators, the revised bill's core remains unchanged: restructuring and cutting the critical Medicaid social safety-net program, taking away insurance from millions of Americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable Americans, especially older people and the sick. The revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a moderate who had opposed the original bill. It would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums – at least 75 percent above the national average. Alaska is the only state with premiums that high, Senate aides said.  Unacceptable Flaws  Hospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the Senate Republican approach, particularly proposed Medicaid cuts. The cuts would result in lower revenues for hospital companies like Community Health Systems Inc and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare and Centene Corp.  Slideshow (21 Images)Molina Healthcare, which has more than 1 million customers on the Obamacare individual exchanges and manages Medicaid health programs, said the changes would leave insurers competing for the least risky customers and would make plans for sick people unaffordable.  The American Hospital Association said the new version of the bill retained the  unacceptable flaws  of the previous version.  Instead of merely putting forth an update, we again call on the Senate to put forth an upgrade,  Rick Pollack, president of the association, said in a statement. Healthcare stocks were mostly unmoved by the announcement, as Wall Street analysts described the core of the revised bill as largely unchanged from the earlier one. The new bill includes another $45 billion for fighting the opioid addiction epidemic, on top of the $2 billion in the earlier version. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which forecast that the previous version would have increased the number of Americans without health insurance by 22 million by 2026, is due to evaluate the new bill in coming days. The Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people, in large part by expanding Medicaid. The House of Representatives on May 4 passed its own version of healthcare legislation. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority, with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a potential tie-breaking vote. Any bill passed by the Senate would have to go back to the House for approval. Repealing and replacing Obamacare, which Republicans fault as a costly government intrusion into the healthcare system, was a top campaign promise for Trump, who was monitoring the Senate developments during his visit to Paris.  I'd say the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians is healthcare,  Trump told reporters on his flight to Paris.

Egypt agreed to a three-year, $12 billion IMF loan programme in November that is tied to ambitious economic reforms such as subsidy cuts and tax hikes.  The government and the central bank have taken the right measures to rein in inflation, reduce the budget deficit, and set the Egyptian economy on a path to stability and growth,  Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF said in a statement. Last week, the government increased electricity prices by up to 42 percent this fiscal year for households. A week earlier, it raised fuel prices by up to 50 percent to help meet the terms of its IMF loan agreement. Egypt's central bank, faced with accelerating inflation, raised its key interest rates by 200 basis points for the second policy meeting in a row, surprising economists who had forecast no change. The bank raised interest rates by three percentage points after the currency flotation. The IMF has said lowering inflation is crucial to keeping the reform programme on track and that raising interest rates could be an appropriate tool for doing so. Egypt floated its currency in November, and since then its pound has roughly halved in value. As the currency's value dropped, inflation surged. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food reached 31.95 percent year on year in June. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is under pressure to balance IMF-austerity reforms to fix Egypt's economy while limiting the financial impact on poorer Egyptians who are key to re-electing him for a second term in next year's presidential election. Sisi last month announced a raft of new spending, including more than doubling monthly food subsidies effective starting July 1, a freeze to taxes on agricultural lands, and an increase of 15 percent in civil servant pensions. The lion's share of the social spending allocation will be channeled into monthly food subsidies, which will increase to 50 pounds per person from 21 currently, a hike that will cost the state an additional 38 billion Egyptian pounds ($2.12 billion) in the current fiscal year's budget, which began in July.  I am very pleased that the government has taken and will continue to take measures to protect the poor and vulnerable groups, including through increasing social spending,  Lagarde added.

Mexico's antitrust agency (Cofece) in April said it was investigating alleged price manipulation in the market for government bonds and media reports said the regulator was targeting global banks operating in Mexico. When asked if such practices were widespread in Mexico, Carstens said  to a large extent that has been absent in our markets.  He underscored however  if there have been some events in the past, those events have not interfered with the conduction of our policies.   Our own perception is that market behavior has been adequate and that the price formation mechanisms in our markets have behaved well,  he said, adding that he was not privy to the specific events that the antitrust regulator was probing. In May, the central bank said it was preparing to implement a new code of conduct governing foreign exchange and bond trading during the second half of the year. The codes are based on best practice forex rules published by the Bank for International Settlements'(BIS) Foreign Exchange Working Group in May.  The BIS code emerged out of market manipulation scandals where global banks were fined billions of dollars surrounding the fixing of the Libor rate and foreign exchange trading. Carstens said the new rules would not prevent  rogue traders  and he stressed that the Cofece probe and the decision by the central bank to develop the codes of conduct were separate issues.   One ... had to do with events that happened in a very particular time in the past, and what we are ... trying to build is to establish a much stronger foundation for the development of our markets in the future,  he said.

The Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs have been affirmed at 'F1+'. The issue ratings on China's senior unsecured bonds are also affirmed at 'A+' and 'F1+'. The Country Ceiling is affirmed at 'A+'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of the ratings and Outlook reflects the following key rating drivers: China's ratings are underpinned by the strength of its external finances and macroeconomic track record. The country's near-term growth prospects remain favourable, and economic policies have been effective in responding to a variety of domestic and external pressures over the past year. However, a further increase in the economy's overall leverage in the context of continued adherence to ambitious GDP growth targets raises the potential for economic and financial shocks and, in Fitch's view, will constrain growth prospects over the medium-term. Large and rising debt levels across China's non-financial sector, combined with the low stand-alone credit quality of Fitch-rated banks in its financial system (as indicated by their average viability rating of 'bb') remain the most significant risk factor for the sovereign rating. The agency expects official aggregate financing (excluding equity) will rise to 208% of GDP in 2017, from 201% in 2016 and 114% in 2008. Fitch's Financial Institutions team estimates that a broader credit measure, which incorporates activity not directly captured in the official series, will rise to around 270% at end-2017. Household debt remains moderate despite its rapid growth in recent years, but China's corporate sector has become the most highly indebted among major economies globally, based on figures from the Bank for International Settlements. External finances are robust in absolute terms and relative to peers, and are expected to remain so over our rating horizon. Capital outflows have fallen sharply since early 2017 due to improved market sentiment, stabilising currency expectations, and various measures to more effectively enforce existing capital controls and scrutinise outward direct investment. The current account also remains in surplus. As a result, foreign reserves have stabilised, rising by USD46 billion so far this year to USD3.06 trillion as of end-June 2017. The potential remains for capital outflow pressures to resume, especially in the context of a strengthening US dollar. Moreover, the effectiveness of capital flow management measures can diminish over time as market participants find ways around them. Fitch therefore forecasts sovereign net foreign assets (SNFA) will decline to 28.9% of GDP at end-2017, down modestly from 29.8% in 2016, but still well above the 'A' median of 5.1%. Internationalisation of the Chinese yuan (CNY) has slowed as measured by its share in global payments and the size of offshore deposits, but its designation as a reserve currency by the IMF in late 2016 provides an important rating cushion shared by only a limited number of sovereigns globally. The IMF's latest Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) confirms the results of other market-based surveys that CNY internationalisation has slowed, with its share in global reserves falling to 0.9% in March 2017 versus slightly over 1% in 2015. Ongoing initiatives to increase foreign participation in China's domestic bond market including the recently launched Bond Connect could encourage a rise over time, but may be constrained in the short run by what appears to be an asymmetric opening of the country's capital account, with restrictions on inflows relaxed while those on outflows remain largely unchanged. Growth momentum remains strong, due to the effectiveness of prior stimulus measures, resilient consumer trends, and a more favourable external environment that has nudged up net exports' contribution to overall growth. Real GDP grew by 6.9% in 1Q17, up from 6.7% in 2016, and is well on track to meet the authorities' 2017 target of  around 6.5% . Strong growth momentum has given the authorities renewed confidence to address financial risks, including the release of new guidelines by the China Banking Regulatory Commission to enhance bank supervision and reduce regulatory arbitrage, statements by senior party leaders on the need to strengthen risk prevention, and the facilitation of higher market interest rates by the People's Bank of China to squeeze out speculative activity in the shadow banking sector. The increased focus on financial risks increases the potential for a more decisive shift in policy direction, but has yet to be reflected in official GDP growth and monetary targets. Tighter monetary conditions may lead to slower GDP growth, which in Fitch's baseline forecast will decelerate to 5.9% in 2018, from 6.5% in 2017. Macro-prudential regulations and tighter credit conditions will, in Fitch's forecasts, result in a slowdown in the housing sector and investment spending. Aggregate financing (excluding equity) based on official measures continues to grow at a stable rate of about 12.5% (in excess of nominal GDP growth), but broader measures of financing activity, including municipal bonds and credit extended to non-bank financial institutions have already started to decelerate. Upside risks to our forecasts remain. They include a more sustained improvement in global trade, continued resilience in the property sector, or additional government stimulus measures not factored into our baseline. Even after factoring in our anticipated deceleration, China's five-year average annual growth rate of 6.7% will continue to exceed the 'A' category median of 3.0% by a wide margin. Public finances remain a neutral rating factor. Fitch forecasts general government gross debt (GGGD) of 48.3% at end-2017, up marginally from a year prior, but broadly in line with the 'A' category median of 49.5%. The agency's GGGD figures are roughly 11.5% of GDP, higher than official estimates due to the inclusion of contingent liabilities identified in a previous government audit. The authorities' continued efforts to disentangle local government financing vehicles (LGFV) from public sector balance sheets have resulted in the release of several new guidelines that restrict local governments from extending formal support to LGFVs and reiterate the government's intention that LGFVs be treated by creditors on a stand-alone basis. Nevertheless, the continued prevalence of implicit support as exemplified by a minimal widening of yield spreads between local government and LGFV bonds highlights the implementation challenges at the local level, and increases the potential for fiscal shocks. Fitch's base-case scenario continues to assume a slowdown in China's medium-term growth trajectory, consistent with declining potential growth. Moreover, rising financial fragilities associated with the continued rise in system-wide leverage increase the risk of a sharper and more disruptive slowdown. However, in the agency's view, the government's still-pervasive ownership and influence across creditors and borrowers in the financial system broadens the spectrum and effectiveness of policy tools available to mitigate such an outcome. China's levels of income and development remain low compared with peers, even after nearly 40 years of rapid growth since market-oriented reforms began in 1978. Average income is around USD8,387 at market rates, or USD13,130 at purchasing-power parity, well below the 'A' medians of USD19,259 and USD27,714 respectively. Standards of governance also lag 'A' category peers based on standard international surveys including the World Bank's Governance Indicators. These fundamental credit weaknesses weigh on the ratings. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns China a score equivalent to a rating of A+ on the Long-term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - External Finances: +1 notch, to reflect strengths in China's external finances not captured in the SRM. The adjustment from a +2 notch adjustment to +1 notch within External Finances reflects the inclusion of the CNY's reserve currency flexibility score in the SRM following its designation by the IMF in late 2016 and the consequent removal of the need to adjust for that factor in the QO. - Structural Features: -1 notch, to reflect weaknesses in the banking sector for which the average Viability Rating is two categories below the sovereign rating. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three-year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that could lead to negative rating action, individually or collectively, are: - A continuation of policy settings that result in a further build-up of the economy's imbalances and vulnerabilities. - An adverse macroeconomic or financial shock that weakens medium-term growth prospects or negatively affects public finances. - Sustained capital outflows sufficient to erode China's external balance sheet strengths, or undermine financial stability. The main factors that could lead to positive rating action, individually or collectively, are: - Greater confidence that the debt problem in the broader economy can be resolved without a material negative impact to growth or financial stability. - Increased evidence that the economy can rebalance smoothly. - Widespread adoption of the Chinese yuan as a reserve currency globally. KEY ASSUMPTIONS - The ratings assume the continuation of a broadly open global trade and financial order. - Fitch assumes China's basic social and political stability is broadly maintained and that regional geopolitical risks do not escalate sharply.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

But the intent gaze of her kohl-rimmed eyes, as she stands with arms folded on the edge of the dancefloor in an all-black outfit, watching couples bob and twirl to the music, gives away her real occupation.  She is Social's famous female bouncer. Mehrunnisha has been a bouncer for nearly a decade, and for the last three years, has done 10-hour night shifts at Social, which functions as a restaurant and co-working space seating 220 people by day, but morphs into a packed club at night.   Now Mehrunnisha is expert in breaking up bar fights, frisking female customers, and uncovering illegal drugs.   We decided to employ women to make sure that women customers too felt safe, and we found a great match in Mehrunnisha,  said Social's owner Riyaaz Amlani, who says she helped has defuse innumerable alcohol-fuelled quarrels.  She was fierce and determined, and the rest is history.  The 30-year-old's career highlights include being part of the security detail for Bollywood actresses such as Priyanka Chopra, the star of the U.S. television drama series  Quantico , Preity Zinta and Vidya Balan. Mehrunnisha is no stranger to smashing stereotypes. Growing up in a large Muslim family in the northern farming town of Saharanpur, 200 km (124 miles) from Delhi, she dreamed of joining the army or becoming a police officer, but her deeply conservative father opposed the idea. Bouncer Mehrunnisha Shokat Ali offers her evening prayer during holy month of Ramadan at her house in New Delhi, India, May 31, 2017.Adnan AbidiOnly her mother's insistence allowed her to further her education beyond primary school.   But when her father's stock market losses forced the family to move to the capital, Mehrunnisha, still in college, became the breadwinner for a household consisting of parents, two sisters, and her elder sister's three children, besides herself.  Several times my brother has asked me, what sort of a job is this?  Mehrunnisha said during a shopping expedition to prepare for Eid al-Fitr, which ends the holy month of Ramadan, recounting how difficult it had been to get her family to accept her night shifts.      But this does not affect me, because my mother and father have faith and confidence in me, and I know I am not doing anything wrong.  Slideshow (18 Images)Her younger sister, Tarannum, 27, also works as a bouncer at a bar just a 5-minute walk away from her own workplace. Together, they earn 30,000 rupees ($465) a month.  They take immense pride in their vocation, spending up to an hour at the gym each day to build their strength, and even working through holidays.   I am very proud of what I do, it's not an easy job,  Mehrunnisha said.  Taking care of people, especially women in a club, is a very big responsibility.  Customers seem to agree.  If I come here and I see a female bouncer, I feel a lot safer,  said one regular patron at Social, Nikita Lamba.  Mehrunnisha is pretty kick-ass. She is good at what she does .

(Reuters) - Proposals by U.S. Senate Republicans to phase out the expansion of the Medicaid health insurance program for low-income Americans could hurt state efforts to fight the country's opioid drug addiction crisis, governors warned on Thursday. Democratic and Republican governors meeting in Rhode Island warned that many residents of their states were relying on Medicaid to get treatment for opioid addiction, which grips an estimated 3 million Americans and killed 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, according to federal data.  We're kidding ourselves if we don't think what's happening with healthcare in Congress right now is affecting this issue,  North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, told his counterparts at a meeting of the National Governors Association in Providence.  We cannot have millions of Americans lose their health coverage and still effectively attack this crisis. We can't significantly reduce Medicaid spending and still be successful in fighting opioid addiction.  Cooper spoke the day that U.S. Senate Republican leaders released revised legislation intended to salvage efforts by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law popularly known as Obamacare. (L-R) North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker take part in the  Curbing the Opioid Epidemic  session at the National Governors Association summer meeting in Providence, Rhode Island, U.S., July 13, 2017.Brian SnyderThe bill would phase out Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid and make sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025. At least one Republican governor at the meeting, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, shared Cooper's concerns about proposed cuts. Slideshow (8 Images) We're reviewing the version that was released today. The first version made very severe cuts to Medicaid and some other programs that would have had a very significant impact to our state. It's one of the main reasons I came out against it,  Sununu said in a brief interview.  They have to solicit the input from those of us governors, mayors, county commissioners, all the way down. Those of us who are implementing these programs are the ones that really understand the impact.  Governors from both parties said they were focusing much of their efforts on the crisis on requiring doctors to reduce their prescriptions of the drugs, as well as increasing the availability of treatment for addicts.  In Rhode Island and in a number of states, we are very effectively using Medicaid coverage to allow people to seek treatment for their opioid addiction,  said Governor Gina Raimondo, a Democrat. Under the proposed scaling back of Medicaid, she added:  That would all be stripped away.

We are headed for a long estrangement ... we are very far from a political solution involving a change in Qatar's course, and in light of that nothing will change and we have to look for a different format of relations,  Anwar al-Gargash said. The statement suggested no breakthrough in the situation after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson left the Gulf on Thursday following a three-day tour of Gulf Arab countries aimed at easing the worst dispute among U.S.-allied Arab states in years. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism and regional arch-foe Iran, charges Doha denies. During his Doha visit, Tillerson signed a U.S.-Qatari accord on terrorism financing in an effort to help ease the crisis, but Qatar's opponents said it fell short of allaying their concerns. The State Department said on Thursday that Tillerson hoped the parties in the dispute could soon negotiate face-to-face.   Based on his meetings, the secretary believes that getting the parties to talk directly to one another would be an important next step,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters.  We hope the parties will agree to do so.

Following are reactions by statement and on social media from nominees for television's highest honors, which will be handed out on Sept. 17 in a Los Angeles ceremony.  Chuffed, thrilled, proud, honored! So delighted for everyone involved. A proper fat cigar moment, if only I smoked. Drinks all round, if only I drank. I shall have to make do with turning cartwheels.  Peter Morgan, creator of  The Crown   If at first you don’t succeed, try try try try try try try try try try again!  Kevin Spacey, actor,  House of Cards   In a year of such great television it's a privilege to be nominated and having seen my fellow nominees work just to be in their company is winning enough. Couldn't be happier for me and the show.  Benedict Cumberbatch, actor,  Sherlock: The Lying Detective   Wow this is just unbelievable! Thank you so so much to the Academy for this incredible honor and for all the love you gave Stranger Things. We are so proud to be in the company of such inspiring artists.  Matt and Ross Duffer, creators of  Stranger Things   For our show to even be in a general conversation with these other stellar programs - it’s beyond our wildest dreams... it’s so exciting to see such incredibly nice things happen to such incredibly nice people.  Dan Fogelman, creator of  This is Us   Well I'm in a little bit of shock!! 13 nominations is absolutely insane. I woke up to a gif from my publicist Erica of a shirtless Anthony Rizzo from the Cubs and knew it was good news (because a shirtless Rizzo is always good news) but 13 is blowing my mind!...  Elisabeth Moss, actor,  The Handmaid's Tale   Thanks and congratulations to our voice, our creator — Margaret Atwood. Brilliant, dauntless, hilarious, and generous, she is our guiding light. Margaret, you make us all brave.    Don’t let the bastards grind you down.  Bruce Miller, executive producer  The Handmaid's Tale  “When we started on this journey we never thought the series would connect on such a big way worldwide. I have never experienced anything like it and as producers and actors we all bow down to the Academy with thanks!” Nicole Kidman, actor and executive producer,  Big Little Lies   Every day working with this incredible cast and crew is a dream (and not one of those dreams where you wake up being operated on by guys in a glass basement). But it's a special thrill today to see all of the amazing people who worked so hard on this show recognized in such an extraordinary fashion!  Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, creators of  Westworld   Almost four years into this journey... it's such a thrill to have the collective efforts of our talented cast, crew, designers, directors and writers recognized by the Television Academy.  Beau Willimon, executive producer,  House of Cards   The news of this nom at 1:38 a.m. in the Antipodes is wonderful. For me it is not only a celebration of having failed so badly in Physics at High School, but also great for Nat Geo entering a new playing field and bringing Einstein and the crucial value of scientific questioning into the spotlight.  Geoffrey Rush, actor,  Genius   I am beyond honored and grateful for the nominations for FEUD; this was a great year for women’s stories on television and it’s moving and affirming to see Emmy voters recognizing so much good work. It’s a proud day for all of us who worked on this series but an even prouder day for this medium which I love. How lucky are we to be a part of it?” Ryan Murphy, executive producer,  Feud: Bette and Joan   We are elated to still be even mentioned in this conversation after so many years. Knowing this is for our eighth season, I was prepared for a depressing morning (both my shrink and Bloody Mary ingredients were on standby) so now I don’t know what to do with myself.  Steven Levitan, executive producer,  Modern Family   I am so honored to be included in this extraordinary group of women. And I am very grateful to Robert, Tina, and all of our cast and crew who make my job so pleasant. Go Russia! I mean, go USA!” Ellie Kemper, actor,  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt   Ahhhh! Only in my dreams could I have imagined this... This is an unbelievable honor, and I can't wait to dance the night away with the cast and Stranger Things team!  Millie Bobby Brown, actor,  Stranger Things   So honored to be nominated, so honored to be able to work as an actor. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Mandy Patinkin, actor,  Homeland   It has already been a true honor to be entrusted with playing Ofglen; a character and inspiration originated by Margaret Atwood and so beautifully crafted by Bruce Miller... For Handmaid's to now receive this much recognition, it's humbling, yet I'm so proud, and really excited for everyone.  Alexis Bledel, actor,  The Handmaid's Tale   I love bringing Jimmy Mcgill/Saul to life. As written by Peter Gould and Vince Gilligan and the staff, he's a complex, compromised, and funny fella – he's got everything going on! It is the part of a lifetime, and I'm glad it's working so well for so many people.  Bob Odenkirk, actor,  Better Call Saul   I am delighted that 'The Night Of' was acknowledged across the board in so many different categories. I am proud to be a part of this talented team from Steve, Richard, James, Riz, Bill, Michael and HBO.

The blockade, which began more than a week ago at the BR-163 highway, is preventing trucks from unloading grains at the riverside hub of Miritituba, from where barges carry crops to Barcarena and Santarém ports before hitting export markets. The highway is the only route to Miritituba, the final stop for trucks carrying loads from Mato Grosso, which is currently harvesting its winter corn. Groups are protesting a veto by President Michel Temer of legislation that would reduce the area under protection at a national forest in Pará state. The situation underscores how Brazilian logistical woes hamper the country's efforts to consolidate its position as a reliable global commodities supplier. If disruptions persist, grain shipments at the port in Miritituba could ground to a complete halt by Friday, Abiove said.  Even if the blockades are called off and freight services resume at Miritituba, it would take several days to reorganize the flow of trucks and barges,  said Daniel Furlan Amaral, Abiove manager. Cancellation of shipping contracts at the port of Barcarena is  inevitable,  he said. Other northern ports such as Santarém can be fed through alternative waterways or railways, Amaral said. Abiove estimates 120,000 tonnes of grain are stored at warehouses in Barcarena, enough to load two ships.  The Brazilian unit of Bunge Ltd, which operates terminals at Miritituba and Barcarena, said in a statement the blockades would affect its grains shipping schedule and cause losses. Cargill Inc, which operates in Santarém, declined to comment and referred inquiries to Brazilian private ports association ATP, which has previously said it expects $47 million in losses this month from the protests. Brazil's cereals exporters association Anec estimated the disruptions could cost producers $400,000 per day and rerouting exports through southern ports would add 50 reais ($15.57) per tonne to freight costs. Anec data showed 30,000 tonnes of grains pass daily through Miritituba with final destination to the northern ports of Barcarena and Santarém. Anec estimates grain exports at these ports will reach 8.7 million tonnes this year. Northern ports including São Luiz, Itacoatiara, Santarém and Barcarena exported 19 percent of Brazilian corn and soy last year up from 17.2 percent in 2014, according to government data.

Mexico's antitrust agency (Cofece) in April said it was investigating alleged price manipulation in the market for government bonds and media reports said the regulator was targeting global banks operating in Mexico. When asked if such practices were widespread in Mexico, Carstens said  to a large extent that has been absent in our markets.  He underscored however  if there have been some events in the past, those events have not interfered with the conduction of our policies.   Our own perception is that market behavior has been adequate and that the price formation mechanisms in our markets have behaved well,  he said, adding that he was not privy to the specific events that the antitrust regulator was probing. In May, the central bank said it was preparing to implement a new code of conduct governing foreign exchange and bond trading during the second half of the year. The codes are based on best practice forex rules published by the Bank for International Settlements'(BIS) Foreign Exchange Working Group in May. The BIS code emerged out of market manipulation scandals where global banks were fined billions of dollars surrounding the fixing of the Libor rate and foreign exchange trading. Carstens said the new rules would not prevent  rogue traders  and he stressed that the Cofece probe and the decision by the central bank to develop the codes of conduct were separate issues.  One ... had to do with events that happened in a very particular time in the past, and what we are ... trying to build is to establish a much stronger foundation for the development of our markets in the future,  he said.

British shoppers are feeling the impact of subdued wage growth and creeping inflation, and recent surveys have shown a sharp drop in consumer confidence.  I would have preferred to start my first year as managing director of John Lewis in slightly more benign conditions,  Paula Nickolds said at a media dinner, highlighting the squeeze on consumers' disposable income, an inconclusive national election and concerns over Britain's exit from the European Union. Nickolds, a 23-year John Lewis veteran and the first woman to run the 152-year old, employee-owned chain, succeeded Andy Street as managing director in January. Street, MD for a decade, quit the post to contest the election of the mayor of the West Midlands, a region of central England, for the ruling Conservative Party. He won in May.  The backdrop is very uncertain and it was made worse by the tragic events that happened across British cities over the last few months,  Nickolds said in reference to multiple terror attacks in London and Manchester. Nickolds said the John Lewis customer was not immune:  They feel uncertain and worried about what the circumstances will mean for their future financial prosperity.  John Lewis' has reported sales rose 1.2 percent in the 23 weeks to July 8, which analysts estimate equates to a like-for-like sales fall of about 0.5 percent.  It's the more considered categories, the arguably deferrable spend, that we're seeing most affected by the uncertainty in the macro conditions - so those big ticket categories are currently trading just behind last year,  said Nickolds. However, she said trading in spontaneous categories was holding up robustly, with beauty sales up 7 percent on last year and womenswear up 4.4 percent.  We believe those (numbers) to be significantly ahead of the market,  she said.  Perhaps (it's) the lipstick effect as we might have called it back in the recession (of 2008).  John Lewis typically makes more than 40 percent of its annual profit in the five weeks that run into Christmas.  So there is still all to play for,  said Nickolds.

The Republican proposals to repeal and replace the U.S. Affordable Care Act (ACA) would be a disaster for older Americans not yet on Medicare - but they also endanger Medicare itself. The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) under consideration in the U.S. Senate would mean higher premiums and reduced cost-sharing subsidies for lower-income older people. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated, for example, that under this bill the annual premium for a 64-year-old person who earns $56,800 would skyrocket by $13,700. And the Medicaid cuts will put the squeeze on states’ ability to fund long-term care (reut.rs/2tfvvZt). Meanwhile, tax cuts for the wealthy contained in some of the Republican proposals would bring closer the projected insolvency date of the Medicare Part A trust fund, which pays for hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice benefits. Insolvency would require either a new revenue source or a reduction of healthcare services the program provides. The trustees of Medicare and Social Security released their respective annual reports on Thursday on the health of the programs. The news about the Part A trust fund was encouraging: the Medicare report said that lower-than-expected program spending in 2016 has pushed out the predicted date of insolvency for the Hospital Insurance Trust fund by one additional year, to 2029.  But the Republican reform efforts could worsen that outlook. The American Health Care Act approved by the House of Representatives in March would repeal the Medicare payroll surtax on high-income workers, which was added under the ACA to shore up the hospital insurance trust fund. The first version of the BCRA also repealed the payroll surtax.  On Thursday, however, Senate Republicans scrambling to save their struggling proposal unveiled a new version that would keep the tax - along with the net investment income tax. That tax imposes a 3.8 percent surtax on investment income for joint filers with more than $250,000 of adjusted gross income (AGI), and single filers with more than $200,000 of AGI. (Receipts from the investment tax go into the federal government’s general revenue coffers.) Both of these tax cuts could easily reappear as the horse trading continues. So it is worthwhile to consider how elimination of the payroll surcharge, in particular, could damage Medicare’s financial health. Medicare taps funding from several different sources. Part B (outpatient services) and Part D (prescription drugs) receive  about three-quarters of their funding from general federal revenue, with the remainder coming from beneficiary premiums. Their financing is adequate into the indefinite future because the programs rely on these flexible revenue sources. Meanwhile, Part A is financed almost entirely by payroll taxes. Workers and employees each pay 1.45 percent of wages into the fund; the ACA increased the tax for taxpayers earning more than $200,000 (individual) and $250,000 (joint filers) by 0.9 percentage point.  Rising Cost Pressure Medicare faces rising enrollment - and financial pressure - due to the retirement of the baby boomer generation. The number of enrollees is projected to rise from 57 million in 2016 to nearly 90 million by 2040, according to the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI). At the same time, the rising tide of boomer retirements means that the workforce paying Part A payroll taxes is growing more slowly. Rising healthcare costs also play an important role. The price of healthcare has been rising at about double the rate of general inflation. The solvency threat applies only to Part A, due to its reliance on the payroll tax. The trustees’ projected insolvency date has fluctuated a great deal over time; since 1970, it has been as close as two years away, and as distant as 28 years, according to NASI. Today’s projection is in the middle of those ranges. In 2009 - just before enactment of the ACA - the Medicare trustees forecast that insolvency was just eight years away. When the ACA passed, that number jumped to 19 years - due in part to the payroll tax surcharge but also reductions in payments to Medicare Advantage providers and to healthcare providers. Since then, the number has drawn somewhat closer. The ACA’s payroll surtax has provided a shot in the arm to the hospital insurance trust fund; repealing it would move up the projected insolvency date by a full two years, from 2028 to 2026, according to the CBO. The term “insolvency” does not mean bankruptcy for a government programme like Medicare. Instead, it would mean Medicare would have sufficient resources to pay only 88 percent of promised benefits. The shortfall would have to be closed by raising new revenue, slowing growth in spending, or both. And Republican leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan routinely toss around insolvency as a justification for schemes to further privatize Medicare by sending seniors into an insurance marketplace with vouchers to buy coverage.  “It’s an open question what would happen,” said Juliette Cubanski, associate director of the programme on Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “We’ve gotten close to it a couple times, but it’s never happened - and there is no statutory language governing a situation where the trust fund has no assets and insufficient funding to pay benefits. The spectre of it is daunting.” Editing by Matthew Lewis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-medicare-idUSKBN19Y30G"},

Senator Sherrod Brown said that Ross  pretty much committed  to announcing these options next week as part of Commerce's review of whether steel imports are threatening U.S. national security under a 1962 trade law. But Ross, speaking to reporters following a closed-door meeting with Senate Finance Committee members, declined to put a time frame on the review's release.  It'll come out when it's ready to come out,  he said. The 79-year-old former steel industry magnate said he spoke to senators about the broad outlines of the  Section 232  probe, including its legal basis and objectives,  the potential tools for accomplishing those objectives, what are the risks involved in the process.  Ross did not provide any details on specific recommendations to Trump, saying the purpose of the meeting was to provide senators  with some background within which they can judge their reaction to the report when it comes out.  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross looks up while addressing the SelectUSA Investment Summit, National Harbour, Maryland, U.S., June 20, 2017.Kevin LamarqueTrump told reporters on his flight to France that he was considering both tariffs and quotas to stop foreign countries from dumping steel into the U.S. market and  destroying  the U.S. steel industry. The release of his remarks sent steel stocks soaring on Thursday.  The options are everything,  said Brown, a Democrat from a major steel-producing state.  I pushed him to move quickly on this.

The FCC wants a reliable verification system that would prevent scam artists from spoofing the number of a bank, debt collector, government tax agency or other organizations to trick consumers into disclosing confidential financial or account information. One report estimates U.S. consumers get 2.5 billion monthly robocalls - automated, prerecorded calls that regulators have labeled a  scourge.  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said  Americans are mad as hell  at robocalls, which represent the top source of consumer complaints. He said he thinks the agency's actions could make a significant dent in the volume of calls and said the FCC is acting as  an aggressive cop on the beat.  Fellow Commissioner Mignon Clyburn agreed.  Given the severity and complexity of the unwanted robocall problem, this agency recognizes that it must take a multi-pronged approach, to address this persistent problem,  Clyburn said. The FCC also wants to prevent unwanted calls after a person gets a reassigned phone number. The agency said there is no single resource with up-to-date phone numbers, and wants public comment on how providers should report when a phone number has been reassigned and how the data could be used. When a consumer cancels an account, the number is returned to a carrier and often reassigned. The agency also voted to begin drafting rules to prevent consumers from being switched to a different phone provider without their permission or having unauthorized charges added to bills. The FCC may require a phone carrier check directly with the consumer before switching an account, rather than relying on a second carrier’s request for the change. Separately, the FCC voted 2-1 to fine New Mexico-based Dialing Services $2.88 million for facilitating  unlawful robocalls  after an investigation in 2012 found the company had made millions of unwanted calls. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, the FCC proposed a $120 million fine on a Florida resident after it alleged his operation made almost 100 million robocalls in a three-month period to trick consumers with  exclusive  vacation deals from well-known travel and hospitality companies. Last year, the FCC formed a task force of more than 30 major technology and communications companies seeking to eliminate robocalls but the group did not propose a comprehensive fix. Carriers cannot block all robocalls or texts because some may be legitimate communications from schools, weather alerts, utilities, political calls and others.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fcc-robocalls-idUSL1N1K42BS"},

Overall, $5.5 billion rolled into exchange-traded stock funds heavily invested by fast-trading investors, while $2 billion flowed out of retail-oriented mutual funds during the week ended July 12. Market gains during the week and moderate talk from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen helped attract a bit of cash back into domestic stocks. The funds pulled in a net $641 million after three weeks of multibillion-dollar outflows and prices widely regarded as dear. Yellen suggested Wednesday that there may be no need for many more hikes to bring rates to a  neutral  level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity. Rates have been ultra-low to stoke growth after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. Pat Keon, Senior Research Analyst at Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit, said investors were looking for a reason to step back into the market.  They're hanging on any good news they can as an excuse to buy,  said Keon. Financial sector funds raked in $1.1 billion in cash ahead of banks' second-quarter earnings results. Non-domestic equity funds, which have been popular for the better part of the year, reeled in another $2.9 billion. Still, not all the flow trends were positive. Energy sector funds posted $407 million in withdrawals, the largest since April, even as oil has since Friday rebounded a bit from recent weakness. And while taxable bond funds pulled in $949 million during the latest week after two weeks of withdrawals, high-yield bond funds posted $1.1 billion in outflows. It was the fourth straight week of withdrawals for  junk  bond funds that have seen a pullback as investors question rich valuations. Japanese stock funds posted $799 million in withdrawals, the most since December 2015, Lipper data showed. The Bank of Japan offered to buy an unlimited amount of government bonds last week to calm the effects of a broad developed-market debt selloff. Yen weakness hurts investors in Japanese stocks who convert their returns back into a currency that has strengthened, like the U.S. dollar.

The bank had said earlier this year that future rate cuts were unlikely before year-end, but unusually strong deflation in June caused some analysts and traders to speculate it would cut the rate by 25 basis points in the coming months. In its decision, the bank said the June inflation numbers were a short-term issue, though some analysts maintained easing remains likely.  Without modifying its bias, the announcement delivered a general tone of trying to convince that everything is in line with previous forecasts, and that fruits and vegetables are principally responsible for the recent negative (inflation) numbers, an outlook that we don't share,  BBVA said in a note to clients. At least one of the bank's board members likely voted to cut the rate, BBVA added. In a separate note, Banco Santander Chile said that any future inflation surprises to the downside would likely spur easing.

Dicamba is sprayed by farmers on crops genetically modified to resist it but it has drifted, damaging vulnerable soybeans, cotton and other crops across the southern United States. Farmers have fought with neighbors over lost crops and brought lawsuits against dicamba producers. Arkansas banned its use last week and Missouri, which initially halted dicamba spraying, has joined Tennessee with tight restrictions on when and in what weather spraying can be done. Kansas is investigating complaints.  We've had damage across just about every acre of soybeans we farm in southeast Missouri,  said Hunter Raffety, a farmer in Wyatt, Missouri.  In our small town, the azaleas, the ornamentals, people have lost their vegetable gardens. It's a big problem.  He suspects between 3,000 and 4,000 acres of soybeans on the 6,000 acres he and his family farm have sustained damage, evidenced by the leaves of plants constricting into cup-like shapes. Monsanto, which said it has spent years working to make dicamba stickier and limit drift when it is sprayed, is campaigning to overturn the bans. It blames early-adoption headaches similar to wind drift and cross-contaminated farm equipment problems the company faced when it launched its popular Roundup Ready glyphosate-resistant crops two decades ago.  In almost every technology in that first year there are kinks that you need to work out,  Robb Fraley, Monsanto's chief technology officer, said on a news media call. He said many of the dicamba issues are caused by farmers not following application labels, using contaminated equipment or buying older formulations of dicamba that are cheaper but more prone to drift. The company, together with BASF SE and DuPont, which also produce dicamba-based weed killers, has agreed to additional safeguards for product use, Missouri Director of Agriculture Chris Chinn said in a statement. The dicamba problem is the latest regulatory woe for Monsanto after California last month announced it would list glyphosate as a probable carcinogen in the state.  It's not good for Monsanto - if anything, this is more likely to lead to lawsuits rather than additional sales,  Jonas Oxgaard, an analyst with asset management firm Bernstein, said regarding the dicamba launch woes. Dicamba is key to Monsanto's biggest-ever biotech seed launch, which occurred last year. Its Xtend line of soybeans and cotton are designed to tolerate the weed killer, which replaces earlier products that contained only glyphosate. Some weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate, which Monsanto introduced in the 1970s. Crop seeds such as corn, soybeans and cotton are genetically modified to survive the pesticide while yield-sapping weeds die. Dicamba has long been used to kill weeds before crops are planted, but its use has spiked this season across the United States after regulators last year approved it for crops that are already growing. Monsanto sells a new dicamba formulation under the name Xtendimax. The company says that Xtendimax drifts less than older versions. BASF and DuPont also sell less drift-prone formulations. New restrictions in Tennessee include allowing application only from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. to limit potential pesticide drift and banning use of older dicamba formulations.  I'm confident that we can address this issue as we have in other cases to ensure the safe and effective use of these tools,  Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Jai Templeton said in a statement. In Monsanto's home state of Missouri, state Farm Bureau President Blake Hurst commended the quick action to update guidelines on dicamba use, which are similar to those in Tennessee.  The Special Local Need label is designed to provide additional protection for neighboring landowners and still allow the application of Dicamba to control weed problems,  he said in a statement.

Overall, $5.5 billion rolled into exchange-traded stock funds heavily invested by fast-trading investors, while $2 billion flowed out of retail-oriented mutual funds during the week ended July 12. Market gains during the week and moderate talk from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen helped attract a bit of cash back into domestic stocks. The funds pulled in a net $641 million after three weeks of multibillion-dollar outflows and prices widely regarded as dear. Yellen suggested Wednesday that there may be no need for many more hikes to bring rates to a  neutral  level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity. Rates have been ultra-low to stoke growth after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. Pat Keon, Senior Research Analyst at Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit, said investors were looking for a reason to step back into the market.  They're hanging on any good news they can as an excuse to buy,  said Keon. Financial sector funds raked in $1.1 billion in cash ahead of banks' second-quarter earnings results. Non-domestic equity funds, which have been popular for the better part of the year, reeled in another $2.9 billion. Still, not all the flow trends were positive. Energy sector funds posted $407 million in withdrawals, the largest since April, even as oil has since Friday rebounded a bit from recent weakness. And while taxable bond funds pulled in $949 million during the latest week after two weeks of withdrawals, high-yield bond funds posted $1.1 billion in outflows. It was the fourth straight week of withdrawals for  junk  bond funds that have seen a pullback as investors question rich valuations. Japanese stock funds posted $799 million in withdrawals, the most since December 2015, Lipper data showed. The Bank of Japan offered to buy an unlimited amount of government bonds last week to calm the effects of a broad developed-market debt selloff. Yen weakness hurts investors in Japanese stocks who convert their returns back into a currency that has strengthened, like the U.S. dollar.

Ryan made his announcement a week after a CBS News report about the long-standing rules went viral on social media. It prompted a slew of reports, including some falsely accusing Ryan of unfairly targeting women, especially given Washington's notoriously hot summers. The current dress code has been in place for years, including under Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who was the only woman to serve as House Speaker, from 2007-11.  This is nothing new and certainly not something that I devised,  Ryan said at a news conference.  At the same time, that doesn't mean that enforcement couldn't stand to be a bit modernized.  The dress code requires men to wear suit jackets and ties in the House chamber and speaker's lobby, which is just outside it, and women are not supposed to wear sleeveless tops or dresses without a sweater or jacket. Neither men nor women are allowed to wear open or athletic footwear. Ryan made clear that all of those standards would not go away.  Decorum is important, especially for this institution,  he said.  And a dress code in the chamber, in the lobby makes sense. But we also don't need to bar otherwise accepted contemporary business attire. So look for a change on that soon.  Amid a flurry of news articles, women House members jumped into the fray. Democratic Representative Jackie Speier circulated a flyer urging women lawmakers to wear sleeveless dresses on  Sleeveless Friday  on July 14, with a photo on the Capitol steps after the day's first vote. Republican Representative Martha McSally noted she was wearing an outfit that violated the code as she ended a speech in the House chamber on Wednesday.  I want to point out that I'm standing here in my professional attire, which happens to be a sleeveless dress and open-toed shoes,  McSally said. It was not McSally's first brush with dress codes. In 2001 when she was an Air Force fighter pilot, McSally sued then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld over the military's policy of requiring military women in Saudi Arabia to wear a head-to-toe  abaya  when off base. Pelosi took to social media to welcome Ryan's statement.   These unwritten rules are in desperate need of updates,  she said on Twitter.

Former Chicago Alderman Edwin Eisendrath and the group of investors beat out Tronc Inc (TRNC.O), the owner of the Chicago Tribune as well as the Los Angeles Times and Baltimore Sun, for the tabloid, the Chicago newspapers reported on Wednesday.   It's a great town as you know and it will continue to have two great newspapers,  Eisendrath said on Twitter.  The U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division opened an investigation in May into the possible sale of the Sun-Times to Tronc and monitored the bidding closely. The department said in a statement on Wednesday it closed its investigation with the paper's sale to ST Acquisition Holdings LLC, the investor group.  Terms of the deal between ST Acquisition Holdings and Sun-Times parent Wrapports LLC were not made public.  The investor group is comprised of corporate restructuring expert William Brandt, the Chicago Federation of Labor, local labor unions and about a half-dozen other individuals, the Sun-Times reported.  Criminal defense attorney Len Goodman, a member of the billionaire Crown family, was said to be the biggest individual investor among the group, Crain's Chicago Business reported.  Labor unions in the city applauded the sale, which also included the Chicago Reader, a weekly.   The little guy won here,  said Chicago Federation of Labor President Jorge Ramirez to the Sun-Times. Wrapports has an annual $25 million contract with Tronc to print and distribute the Sun-Times. The contract is a major source of revenue for Tronc and one of the reasons it wanted to purchase the newspaper, the Sun-Times reported.   tronc will move ahead with our plans to execute growth strategy, leverage technology and increase the digital audience of our award winning journalistic brands,” Tim Knight, president of troncX, said in a statement on Wednesday.  The company expects the new Sun-Times owners to honor the printing and distribution deal, Knight added.  The deal could usher in different models to fund newspapers, said Merrill Brown, founder and principal at MMB Media, citing how billionaire H.F. “Gerry” Lenfest launched an institute to fund newspapers such as the Philadelphia Inquirer.   Also it wouldn't be surprising to see, given who these folks are and their political leanings, that they might create a left-leaning paper,  he said on Thursday of the new Sun-Times owners.

The fun-loving Chinese has long been a model of consistency on the LPGA Tour with her simple swing and straight ball flight, but since claiming Olympic bronze in Rio she has worked to improve her putting and gone on the attack to win more events.   I've been a very consistent player throughout my whole career and I've made many, many top-10s but, compared to my top-10 numbers, before the Olympics last year I'd only won four times on the LPGA,  said Feng.  I wanted to win more.  The 27-year-old, the early first-round leader at the U.S. Women's Open on Thursday after an opening six-under 66, decided to play more aggressively and it is paying off.  It's a good change because so far, from the Olympics to now, I've already got three more wins in the hand and I'm feeling great about my game and when I have a chance to win any week I won't give up,  she said. Feng said a small putting adjustment she made with coach Gary Gilchrist before the tournament paid dividends on Thursday.  I think that's really been helping because I was rolling the ball very nicely on the greens and made a lot of birdies,  said the Chinese, who made six of them in a bogey-free round. Rain-softened greens allowed Feng to fire away at the pins and she took advantage of most of her birdie chances. Feng was full of smiles and comfortable being back in the U.S. after spending last week competing back home in China.  I would say I love America. I mean I love American food. I love steak, maybe buffalo wings. I'm more about meat,  said the stout Chinese, winning laughs from reporters.  I think America is great. You like it? Everybody likes it. If you don't like the food, how can you survive here?  Feng was asked if wearing the cow-spot, black and white  designed clothing was a good luck charm.  I would say that because now the cow pants, cow shorts or the cow outfit has become (part of) my signature, so when I'm wearing the cow pants people recognise me more,  she said.  I like wearing the cow pants because I stand out on the course and people can spot me from like really far away and maybe because of more people supporting me with the cow pants maybe that makes me feel more excited then maybe play better.

Arkansas banned its use last week and Missouri, which initially halted dicamba spraying, has joined Tennessee with tight restrictions on when and in what weather spraying can be done. Kansas is investigating complaints. Monsanto, which said it has spent years working to make dicamba stickier and limit drift when it is sprayed, is campaigning to overturn the bans. It blames early-adoption headaches similar to wind drift and cross-contaminated farm equipment problems the company faced when it launched its popular Roundup Ready glyphosate-resistant crops two decades ago.  In almost every technology in that first year there are kinks that you need to work out,  Robb Fraley, Monsanto's chief technology officer, said on a news media call. He said many of the dicamba issues are caused by farmers not following application labels, using contaminated equipment or buying older formulations of dicamba that are cheaper but more prone to drift. The company, together with BASF SE and DuPont , which also produce dicamba-based weed killers, has agreed to additional safeguards for product use, Missouri Director of Agriculture Chris Chinn said in a statement. The dicamba problem is the latest regulatory woe for Monsanto after California last month announced it would list glyphosate as a probable carcinogen in the state.  It's not good for Monsanto - if anything, this is more likely to lead to lawsuits rather than additional sales,  Jonas Oxgaard, an analyst with asset management firm Bernstein, said regarding the dicamba launch woes. Dicamba is key to Monsanto's biggest-ever biotech seed launch, which occurred last year. Its Xtend line of soybeans and cotton are designed to tolerate the weed killer, which replaces earlier products that contained only glyphosate. Some weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate, which Monsanto introduced in the 1970s. Crop seeds such as corn, soybeans and cotton are genetically modified to survive the pesticide while yield-sapping weeds die. Dicamba has long been used to kill weeds before crops are planted, but its use has spiked this season across the United States after regulators last year approved it for crops that are already growing. Monsanto sells a new dicamba formulation under the name Xtendimax. The company says that Xtendimax drifts less than older versions. BASF and DuPont also sell less drift-prone formulations. New restrictions in Tennessee include allowing application only from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. to limit potential pesticide drift.  I'm confident that we can address this issue as we have in other cases to ensure the safe and effective use of these tools,  Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Jai Templeton said in a statement. In Monsanto's home state of Missouri, state Farm Bureau President Blake Hurst commended the quick action to update guidelines on dicamba use.  The Special Local Need label is designed to provide additional protection for neighboring landowners and still allow the application of Dicamba to control weed problems,  he said in a statement.

I think any witness who's been asked to testify in Congress should do that,  Ryan said at a news conference.     Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican, plans to send a letter on Thursday to Donald Trump Jr. to ask him to testify before his committee in a public session, CNN reported.  If he appeared before the panel, Trump's son would be the highest member of the Republican president's inner circle of relatives and White House aides to testify in Congress about the Russia allegations. Accusations that Moscow interfered in the election and  colluded with the Trump campaign have dominated Trump's first months in office.

Trump Jr. eagerly agreed to meet the lawyer, who he was told was part of Moscow's official support for his father's campaign, according to emails the son released this week. The emails were the most concrete evidence that Trump's campaign might have been willing to accept Russian help to win the election, a subject that has prompted investigations by the U.S. Justice Department and Congress.     Trump said in Paris on Thursday that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was a private attorney and not a Russian government lawyer, and that nothing of substance came of the meeting.  My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting. It was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast,  he said at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. U.S intelligence agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and disseminating false information online.

Banco de Mexico Governor Agustin Carstens said in an interview with Reuters that talk among private economists that rates would be reduced early next year diverged from the bank's view, which was that it would take some time to consolidate inflation toward the bank's 3 percent target.     The Mexican peso firmed 0.52 percent on Thursday, its sixth straight daily gain, and appreciated after Carsten's comments were published.     In Brazil, shares rose as JBS SA, the world's largest meatpacker, stock jumped 9.4 percent after the company got permission from an appeals court to sell assets.      The ruling  sends a positive signal related to the company's divestment plan,  analysts at UBS Securities wrote in a note to clients, referring to JBS's 6 billion reais ($1.9 billion) asset-sale program.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.5 percent, but the Brazilian real was nearly flat on investor caution over the political environment.     A congressional committee was set to vote on Thursday on corruption charges against President Michel Temer after its rapporteur recommended the body vote to put him on trial.      Some traders fear that could delay the implementation of his agenda of structural reforms, which includes revamps of the country's pension system and labor laws.      Most other Latin American currencies strengthened after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's dovish tone in testimony to a Senate panel supported expectations of a slow pace of rate hikes in coming months.     In Chile, the central bank kept the benchmark interest rate  unchanged at 2.5 percent at its monthly meeting on Thursday, as widely expected, and said it maintained a neutral bias.

The  Bond Connect  programme launched this month allows international investors to buy and sell in China’s historically restricted interbank bond market through a Hong Kong trading gateway, and has been hailed as a milestone in the opening up of the country’s capital markets. On the mainland, however, much of the turnover in the bond market is generated from informal chat groups on QQ, a mainstream Chinese mobile chat app, where individual investors look to buy, sell, borrow and lend. In these social chat versions of old-fashioned open outcry sessions, the raw market emotions of fear and greed are played out with emojis and colourful language.  One QQ group that I belong to has trading volumes of 10 billion renminbi in one day,  said a trader at a Shanghai-based asset management firm, referring to trades that originate in the chat groups. She asked not to be named because of relationships with data providers. This volume dwarfs the 7.05 billion yuan traded through the entire Bond Connect on its first day of operation on July 3. While there is no data showing the aggregate trading volume on QQ, the Shanghai-based trader said it is one of the most popular platforms for mainland bond trading. While buyers and sellers meet in the chatrooms, the trades are not conducted within these groups. Instead, traders invite counter-parties to open private chats, usually still in QQ. Launched in 1999 by Tencent Holdings, QQ was once the country's most popular chat platform. In recent years, it has been overtaken by WeChat, also owned by Tencent, but still boasted 861 million active users as of the end of March 2017. Users tend to be young: Tencent says more than 60 percent of active QQ users were born after 1990. And traders say it's the key to participating in the world's third-largest bond market. A trader at an Asian bank in China, who asked not to be named, said that she uses QQ for more than 90 percent of her trades, even though the practice is officially discouraged by her bank for security reasons. Local Quirks While messaging apps are used in other countries to set up trade orders, the scale of China's bond market and its historic isolation from the rest of the world have led to the evolution of a unique chat group trading culture on the mainland.  Through the open platform and QQ groups, we enable our users to be connected to online content developers and a diverse range of interest groups,  Tencent said in an emailed response to Reuters' queries for this story. One such chat group seen by Reuters was filled with more than 1,700 traders, their messages interspersed with the emojis common to QQ group chats. An animated character being squeezed by an red-eyed snake accompanied a desperate message from a trader at a rural credit cooperative:  Need help! Large quantities of overnight money.  The highly informal nature of this part of the market and the exclusive use of Chinese language present barriers for many foreign investors trying access the bond market through QQ. However, these ad hoc methods also reflect the fact that price discovery in bond trading is still less efficient than it is on electronic stock trading platforms -- even in Western markets. Andy Seaman, chief investment officer of London-based Stratton Street Capital, says most bond trades at his firm are still done by phone.  The problem with bond trading in the West is that there's very little appetite from the banks to take any risk, which usually makes it quite difficult to encourage trading,  Seaman said.  China's probably not even as advanced as that, in a sense, because it's not opened up to international investors so much, but I'm sure that will change.

Chile, Latin America's wealthiest country, is the region's highest-rated sovereign debt holder, with a long record of stability, sound fiscal management, and rainy-day buffers in the form of sovereign wealth funds. But falling commodities prices have severely hurt the export-dependent economy in recent years, while a number of corruption scandals in a country that takes pride in its probity have sapped confidence. Business leaders also blame the center-left government of President Michelle Bachelet for generating uncertainty by trying to push a raft of social and economic reforms through an increasingly fractured Congress.  The downgrade reflects prolonged subdued economic growth that has hurt fiscal revenues, contributed to increases in the government's debt burden, and eroded the country's macroeconomic profile,  S&P; said. The downgrade was not entirely unexpected. S&P; had changed its bias on Chile to  negative  from  stable  in January, following a similar move by Fitch in December. However, it is likely to be used as fodder by the political right in this year's presidential election, scheduled for November. The front-runner, billionaire former President Sebastian Pinera, has framed his candidacy as an opportunity to return to the steady growth for which Chile is known after years of stagnation. Shortly after the downgrade was announced, Chilean Finance Minister Rodrigo Valdes told journalists that Chile was still the highest-rated country in the region, sharing the same rating with a number of high-income countries in Europe. He added, however, that the country had to  continue taking seriously  its commitment to reducing its fiscal deficit.  We have to ensure that we have a credible fiscal trajectory,  he said.

Television is proving an embarrassment of riches for women thanks to complex, original characters and female-centric plots that are attracting Oscar-caliber movie stars to the small screen. Once regarded as the step child to Hollywood movies, A-list actors like Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon and Susan Sarandon are flocking to TV series, and jostling for this year's Emmy awards. And there is more to come. Oscar winners Julia Roberts and Penelope Cruz have their first big TV series lined up for next year, while five-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams is due to return to the small screen for the first time since 2005 as the star of HBO's  Sharp Objects.   There is no stigma attached to doing TV anymore, given the opportunities and the writers who are working in television,  said Debra Birnbaum, executive editor of television at Variety.  There is great storytelling with multi-layered, dimensional, rich characters and real women,  she said. While women have long complained about the paucity of good parts for women in Hollywood movies, this year's female Emmy nominees read like a Who's Who of acting.  Feud: Bette and Joan,  starring Jessica Lange and Sarandon as Hollywood rivals Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, is seen by awards pundits in a close race for the limited series Emmy in September with  Big Little Lies,  a murder mystery against a backdrop of wife battering, adultery, rape and gossip.  This was a great year for women's stories on television,  said Ryan Murphy, creator of  Feud,  after the show won 18 Emmy nominations on Thursday.  Big Little Lies,  stars Emmy nominees Kidman, Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern in a tale of rivalry and sisterhood in which men take a decidedly back seat.  FILE PHOTO: Cast member Julia Roberts poses on the red carpet as she arrives for the screening of the film  Money Monster  out of competition at the 69th Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France.Regis Duvignau/File PhotoIt was picked up and produced by Kidman, 50, an Oscar winner for  The Hours,  and Witherspoon, 41, who took home the Academy Award in 2006 for  Walk the Line,  as their first starring roles in series television. The show has 16 Emmy nominations.  There is an incredible audience for stories about women in different places in their lives, and not necessarily about their definitions of themselves in romantic ways,  Witherspoon told Reuters on Thursday. She said she and Kidman chose to make  Big Little Lies  for television rather than as a movie because of TV's ability to connect audiences with longer stories. Slideshow (9 Images) The idea that the only prestige content is in movie theaters is a fallacy,  she added.  Our show was watched pretty much equally by men and women, so the idea that men don't want to watch stories about women is completely false.  If anything it felt that you were pulling back the curtain on female behavior a bit for men, showing their interior lives, how they communicate and how they withhold.  This year's best actress contenders also include Elisabeth Moss in the chilling TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood's  The Handmaid's Tale,  Claire Foy as a young Queen Elizabeth II in  The Crown,  and Viola Davis as a flawed criminal attorney in  How To Get Away with Murder.   Madeline Di Nonno, chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, said it was  inspiring to see such a full spectrum of female characters that are flawed and very relatable.    That's partly a result of the sheer number of television programs now on offer -- around 400 scripted shows -- and the creative freedom offered by disruptors like streaming services Amazon, Netflix and Hulu, who have upended the traditional broadcast model with bold, commercial-free content. Di Nonno said it's also due to concrete steps by veteran TV showrunners like Murphy, Shonda Rhimes, and Melissa Rosenberg to hire more female writers, directors and women behind the camera.

Television is proving an embarrassment of riches for women thanks to complex, original characters and female-centric plots that are attracting Oscar-caliber movie stars to the small screen. Once regarded as the step child to Hollywood movies, A-list actors like Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon and Susan Sarandon are flocking to TV series, and jostling for this year's Emmy awards. And there is more to come. Oscar winners Julia Roberts and Penelope Cruz have their first big TV series lined up for next year, while five-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams is due to return to the small screen for the first time since 2005 as the star of HBO's  Sharp Objects.   There is no stigma attached to doing TV anymore, given the opportunities and the writers who are working in television,  said Debra Birnbaum, executive editor of television at Variety.  There is great storytelling with multi-layered, dimensional, rich characters and real women,  she said. While women have long complained about the paucity of good parts for women in Hollywood movies, this year's female Emmy nominees read like a Who's Who of acting.  Feud: Bette and Joan,  starring Jessica Lange and Sarandon as Hollywood rivals Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, is seen by awards pundits in a close race for the limited series Emmy in September with  Big Little Lies,  a murder mystery against a backdrop of wife battering, adultery, rape and gossip.  This was a great year for women's stories on television,  said Ryan Murphy, creator of  Feud,  after the show won 18 Emmy nominations on Thursday.  Big Little Lies,  stars Emmy nominees Kidman, Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern in a tale of rivalry and sisterhood in which men take a decidedly back seat.  FILE PHOTO: Cast member Julia Roberts poses on the red carpet as she arrives for the screening of the film  Money Monster  out of competition at the 69th Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France.Regis Duvignau/File PhotoIt was picked up and produced by Kidman, 50, an Oscar winner for  The Hours,  and Witherspoon, 41, who took home the Academy Award in 2006 for  Walk the Line,  as their first starring roles in series television. The show has 16 Emmy nominations.  There is an incredible audience for stories about women in different places in their lives, and not necessarily about their definitions of themselves in romantic ways,  Witherspoon told Reuters on Thursday. She said she and Kidman chose to make  Big Little Lies  for television rather than as a movie because of TV's ability to connect audiences with longer stories. Slideshow (9 Images) The idea that the only prestige content is in movie theaters is a fallacy,  she added.  Our show was watched pretty much equally by men and women, so the idea that men don't want to watch stories about women is completely false.  If anything it felt that you were pulling back the curtain on female behavior a bit for men, showing their interior lives, how they communicate and how they withhold.  This year's best actress contenders also include Elisabeth Moss in the chilling TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood's  The Handmaid's Tale,  Claire Foy as a young Queen Elizabeth II in  The Crown,  and Viola Davis as a flawed criminal attorney in  How To Get Away with Murder.   Madeline Di Nonno, chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, said it was  inspiring to see such a full spectrum of female characters that are flawed and very relatable.    That's partly a result of the sheer number of television programs now on offer -- around 400 scripted shows -- and the creative freedom offered by disruptors like streaming services Amazon, Netflix and Hulu, who have upended the traditional broadcast model with bold, commercial-free content. Di Nonno said it's also due to concrete steps by veteran TV showrunners like Murphy, Shonda Rhimes, and Melissa Rosenberg to hire more female writers, directors and women behind the camera.  It excites me to see such rich roles for women on television,  said Birnbaum.  Emmy voters definitely have their work cut out.

Kleinfeld,MICHAEL BRAVE,ARCONIC,LAWSUIT/,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A shareholder of Arconic Inc on Thursday filed a lawsuit accusing the company of defrauding shareholders over its supply of cladding panels used at Grenfell Tower, the London high-rise where at least 80 people died in a fire last month. In his proposed class-action complaint, Michael Brave is seeking to recoup  significant  shareholder losses stemming from Arconic's failure prior to the June 14 blaze to properly disclose its use of  highly flammable  Reynobond PE panels. The shareholder lawsuit filed in the federal court in Manhattan, where Arconic is based, may be the first in the United States tied to the fire that gutted the 24-story Grenfell Tower, in London's North Kensington section. Arconic's share price fell 21 percent between June 14 and June 27, the day after the company once known as Alcoa said it would stop selling the panels for use in high-rises. That decline reduced Arconic's market value by more than $2.5 billion, according to Reuters data. Arconic did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Brave also named former Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld and current Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Giacobbe as defendants. The complaint seeks to allow Arconic shareholders from Feb. 28 to June 26 to sue as a group. Brave said shareholders were deceived by Arconic's inadequate disclosures regarding the cladding panels, and that their use significantly increased the risk of property damage, injury or death in buildings containing them. He said Arconic's public statements were  materially false and misleading at all relevant times,  and that Kleinfeld and Giacobbe should also be held liable for their contents. It is common for shareholders to sue companies in the United States over unexpected stock price declines that they believe could have been averted. Shares of Arconic closed Thursday up 26 cents at $24.45. They had closed at $21.84 on June 27.

Former Chicago Alderman Edwin Eisendrath and the group of investors beat out Tronc Inc (TRNC.O), the owner of the Chicago Tribune as well as the Los Angeles Times and Baltimore Sun, for the tabloid, the Chicago newspapers reported on Wednesday.   It's a great town as you know and it will continue to have two great newspapers,  Eisendrath said on Twitter.  The U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division opened an investigation in May into the possible sale of the Sun-Times to Tronc and monitored the bidding closely. The department said in a statement on Wednesday it closed its investigation with the paper's sale to ST Acquisition Holdings LLC, the investor group.  Terms of the deal between ST Acquisition Holdings and Sun-Times parent Wrapports LLC were not made public.  The investor group is comprised of corporate restructuring expert William Brandt, the Chicago Federation of Labor, local labor unions and about a half-dozen other individuals, the Sun-Times reported.  Criminal defense attorney Len Goodman, a member of the billionaire Crown family, was said to be the biggest individual investor among the group, Crain's Chicago Business reported.  Labor unions in the city applauded the sale, which also included the Chicago Reader, a weekly.   The little guy won here,  said Chicago Federation of Labor President Jorge Ramirez to the Sun-Times. Wrapports has an annual $25 million contract with Tronc to print and distribute the Sun-Times. The contract is a major source of revenue for Tronc and one of the reasons it wanted to purchase the newspaper, the Sun-Times reported.   tronc will move ahead with our plans to execute growth strategy, leverage technology and increase the digital audience of our award winning journalistic brands,” Tim Knight, president of troncX, said in a statement on Wednesday.  The company expects the new Sun-Times owners to honor the printing and distribution deal, Knight added.  The deal could usher in different models to fund newspapers, said Merrill Brown, founder and principal at MMB Media, citing how billionaire H.F. “Gerry” Lenfest launched an institute to fund newspapers such as the Philadelphia Inquirer.   Also it wouldn't be surprising to see, given who these folks are and their political leanings, that they might create a left-leaning paper,  he said on Thursday of the new Sun-Times owners.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted the EPA's request for extra time to examine its next steps in court before being required to enforce the law, which says oil and gas companies must check for and fix methane leaks in their equipment. The 14-day period is far shorter than the minimum of 52 days the agency requested in a July 7 court filing.  To stay issuance of the mandate for longer would hand the agency, in all practical effect, the very delay in implementation this panel determined to be 'arbitrary, capricious and in excess of EPA's statutory authority',  the court ruled. An EPA spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency on June 5 announced a halt to the rule after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wrote in an April 18 letter that the agency intended to reconsider imposing it. But environmental groups sued the EPA, arguing that the agency did not have the authority to halt the rule during those deliberations, and the appeals court agreed.  The court reaffirmed the importance of ensuring that its decision vacating Administrator Pruitt's unlawful suspension of these clean-air protections limiting oil and gas pollution swiftly take effect,  said Peter Zalzal, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups suing the agency, in a news release issued after the ruling.

Hyperloop One, the Los-Angeles-based company developing the technology, is gearing up to send a 28-foot-long (8.5 meter-long) pod gliding across a set of tracks in a test run in Nevada in the next few weeks, spokeswoman Marcy Simon said.  Hyperloop One is working to develop a technical vision proposed by Musk, the founder of rocket maker SpaceX and electric car company Tesla Motors. In 2013, he suggested sending pods with passengers through giant vacuum tubes between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Hyperloop aims to achieve speeds of 250 miles per hour (402 km per hour) in its upcoming phase of testing.

A Hyperloop One sled on wheels for the first time coasted above a track using electromagnetic propulsion and magnetic levitation, Simon said.  It levitated for 5.3 seconds in a vacuum-sealed tube and reached speeds of 70 mph (113 kph), the company said in a statement. By comparison, another test by Hyperloop One that made national headlines last year was done on an open-air track, not in the tube, a key to achieving high speeds.

We can't significantly reduce Medicaid spending and still be successful in fighting opioid addiction.  Cooper spoke the day that U.S. Senate Republican leaders released revised legislation intended to salvage efforts by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law popularly known as Obamacare.

At least one Republican governor at the meeting, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, shared Cooper's concerns about proposed cuts. Slideshow (8 Images) We're reviewing the version that was released today. The first version made very severe cuts to Medicaid and some other programs that would have had a very significant impact to our state. It's one of the main reasons I came out against it,  Sununu said in a brief interview.  They have to solicit the input from those of us governors, mayors, county commissioners, all the way down. Those of us who are implementing these programs are the ones that really understand the impact.  Governors from both parties said they were focusing much of their efforts on the crisis on requiring doctors to reduce their prescriptions of the drugs, as well as increasing the availability of treatment for addicts.  In Rhode Island and in a number of states, we are very effectively using Medicaid coverage to allow people to seek treatment for their opioid addiction,  said Governor Gina Raimondo, a Democrat. Under the proposed scaling back of Medicaid, she added:  That would all be stripped away.

A report by the court-appointed monitor FTI Consulting posted on its website on Wednesday said that more than 20 parties have signed non-disclosure agreements with Sears Canada as part of the planned sale process. Earlier this week, Edward Lampert's ESL Partners LP and Fairholme, which own about two-thirds of Sears Canada, said they were considering a potential deal with the retailer and had engaged a legal adviser. The sale process, which will be conducted by BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc, would consider bids and proposals for deals involving its business, assets and leases, either in whole or in part. Sears Canada, which in 2012 was spun off from U.S. retailer Sears Holdings Corp, filed for creditor protection in June and laid out a restructuring plan that included cutting 2,900 jobs and closing roughly a quarter of its stores. Sears Canada had also planned to seek an order suspending some of its employee obligations including special payments into its pension plan, post-retirement health and dental benefits and life insurance premium payments. But the company, lawyers representing retirees, employees and former employees, and other related parties reached an agreement to continue the payments until Sept. 30.

Ryan Holmes, the 42-year-old founder and CEO of the social-media management platform Hootsuite, had an off-the-grid upbringing that saw him tending to animals instead of web pages. For the latest in Reuters'  Life Lessons  series, Holmes spoke with Reuters about how he transitioned from farm boy to running a company that is said to be at or near  unicorn -level valuation of more than $1 billion. Q: You had a pretty unconventional childhood. Did that give you a unique life perspective? A: Back in the 1970s, my parents left teaching and bought a farm, so that's where I grew up. We were off the grid, with no electricity, a water well and kerosene lamps. We raised goats and chickens and honeybees. That gave me a lot of practical, hands-on life experience - and taught me how to fix things. Q: Who were your biggest influences in getting started in the business world? A: They say that children of entrepreneurs often become entrepreneurs themselves, because the whole process of going into business for yourself has been demystified. My mom was that influence for me. She came from London, and was a world traveler, artist and businesswoman. She helped me set up my first business, a paintball company, when I was only 16. Q: You later dropped out of a college - why was that? A: I wasn't learning a ton that I thought would help me as an entrepreneur. I'm an experiential learner, and the best path for me is just to go out and do it. So I dropped out, started a pizza-by-the-slice restaurant. From that I learned how to set up an operation, and manage it, and be totally involved at all levels. Q: How did you end up in the digital world? A: This was back in 1999 and the internet was taking off, and I decided I wanted to chase that down. So I sold the restaurant, got a top-of-the-line computer, taught myself programming languages like HTML, and learned all about Web presence. From the beginning I was always a bit of a generalist: as a business owner you need to know about a whole lot of different things - and know enough to be dangerous. Q: After Hootsuite became a success, how did you handle your personal wealth? A: With my investment strategy, I tend to be hands-on and not super complex. I have placed some money under management and self-manage some as well. Since I have equity in Hootsuite, I tend to stay away from too many internet stocks, in order to achieve some balance. With my liquid assets, I am pretty middle-of-the-road in my risk tolerance, often with index funds. I also have some real estate properties in my hometown of Vancouver, which has seen pretty incredible growth over the years. There is a ton of foreign investment that drives the real estate market here. Q: What money mistakes have been most humbling for you? A: Some of the hardest lessons have been around growth. We had some business teams that went from zero to $100 million in revenues, which is a huge run. I looked at the bench I had at the time, and it wasn't the right team. Some people had to go. That was super hard. So some of the biggest mistakes have involved keeping people on board for longer than they should have. Sometimes you have to be ruthless about who is on the bus. Q: Where do you direct your philanthropic efforts? A: I am passionate about building a tech ecosystem in Canada. My dream is that I want 100 Hootsuites in Vancouver. We need a whole league of young innovators, so we need to find and accelerate these young entrepreneurs. To do that, Hootsuite donates office space and provides mentorship, and I have personally funded programs like that for a number of years. Q: What would you consider a successful life? A: To have a real legacy, and to create financial independence for a lot of people. So we have to keep leveling up, and - to use a hockey term - figure out where the puck is going. I would love to create something like the 'PayPal Mafia,' an alumni group of entrepreneurs going on to start their own amazing ventures. I want to create the 'Maple Syrup Mafia.'

McNabb, 60, who took the CEO job in 2008, will remain chairman of the Pennsylvania company where he oversaw massive inflows to its low-cost products, including index funds, after steering the company through the financial crisis. Vanguard now manages about $4 trillion, up from about $1.25 trillion at the start of McNabb's reign and far eclipsing rivals like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price Group that are better known for their actively managed mutual funds. Vanguard has also suffered a string of technical glitches since last year and responded by adding staff. Software engineers make up about a quarter of its workforce of about 15,000 people.  The goal is that we not only lead on investment returns, we lead on our level of service to clients,  Buckley, 48, said in an interview. Buckley also aims to continue Vanguard's overseas expansion. Another concern has been that index funds could lose their appeal in a market downturn, which could favor some active fund managers. While Vanguard also offers active funds, Buckley said the concern is misplaced.  There's no good environment for high costs,  he said.  Markets will humble you, and volatility will return. You've got to stay disciplined,  he said. McNabb said the timing seemed right to step back from the top job, and that there were no other internal or external candidates to succeed him after working closely with Buckley on Vanguard's executive committee more than 16 years. Buckley will become the fourth CEO of privately held Vanguard, which began operations in 1975 under founder John C. Bogle, who remains affiliated with the company but is no longer in senior leadership. Buckley joined Vanguard in 1991 as an assistant to Bogle. He later headed Vanguard's information technology division and its retail investor group. Buckley was also named president and a director of Vanguard. Greg Davis, 46, head of fixed income, will take over as chief investment officer. Vanguard named two other new directors, Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former U.S. Treasury official, and Deanna Mulligan, CEO of The Guardian Life Insurance Co of America. Industry observers noted that these director appointments and that of Davis, an African-American, diversify Vanguard's leadership. They  make Vanguard look more like its client base,  said Dan Wiener, who edits a newsletter for Vanguard investors. Although Vanguard's structure makes operations more opaque than those at some publicly traded rivals, it will seek investor approval of these appointments. At a meeting set for Nov. 15 in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a securities filing, Vanguard will ask investors to elect  Buckley, Raskin and Mulligan and other nominees to a board that oversees its mutual funds. It will also seek approval for other changes, including giving funds the ability to hire external managers without shareholder permission, and to change investment objectives of two index funds. Vanguard also faces shareholder proposals including one seeking review of its tendency not to support proxy measures related to climate change. According to a securities filing, Vanguard recommends investors vote against this proposal, saying it uses behind-the-scenes talks to influence company executives on climate issues.

The Trump Presidential Twitter Library opened its doors for business in New York City on Friday, just a few blocks from the businessman-turned-politician's Trump Tower residence. The venture comes from satirical U.S. TV show  The Daily Show  and displays some of Trump's best-known tweets on the social media platform. The Republican president is a prolific user of Twitter, using it to communicate his thoughts on a range of political and other issues and to attack his political and celebrity opponents.  Daily Show  host Trevor Noah said the library, open to the public through Sunday with no admission charges, is aimed at assembling in one place  some of the greatest ideas that have ever been shared in 140 characters or less.   What we've done here today is really put together the finest tweets, the best of the best, the moments that encapsulate what the president means on this beautiful platform,  said Noah, who like other late night television hosts has roundly mocked Trump in his five months in office.     The Trump tweets are arranged in categories including   Constructive Criticism,   Deleted but not Forgotten  and  Always the Best.  Noah said there are tentative plans to take the Twitter library to other cities after its weekend debut in New York. Real presidential libraries - there are 14 of them dotted around the country - preserve a historical record of former presidents and are run by the Office of Presidential Libraries.

The draft bill marks the latest move by the right-wing PiS to increase the influence of elected bodies and the government over the process of appointing judges, which critics and the opposition say violates the constitutional separation of powers. Since winning the 2015 election, the PiS has overhauled the constitutional court. The European Commission has accused the government in Warsaw of undermining democratic checks and balances, charges PiS denies. In contrast, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Poland during a visit to Warsaw last week, saying Poles valued individual freedom and sovereignty. With unemployment at a record low and the economy growing robustly, an opinion poll this week showed support for PiS rose by 4 percentage points to 36 percent compared to a month ago.   One day after this law enters into force, Supreme Court judges appointed in line with the hitherto existing regulations are retired, except for judges chosen by the justice minister,  the draft bill submitted on Wednesday to parliament reads. According to Poland's 1997 constitution, the Supreme Court is tasked with overseeing the activity of courts of general jurisdiction and military courts with respect to their passing of verdicts. It also states that the Supreme Court decides if parliamentary elections are valid.  The Polish Supreme Court president, Malgorzata Gersdorf speaks during a press conference in Warsaw, Poland July 13, 2017.  Agencja Gazeta/Slawomir Kaminski via REUTERS This is how dictatorship starts,  said Borys Budka, a lawmaker from the largest opposition party Civic Platform (PO). Lech Walesa, the hero of the Solidarity movement that shook communist rule in the 1980s, told private broadcaster TVN24 that the bill was  very dangerous, very stupid . PiS says the party has a democratic mandate to make the judiciary more efficient and accountable to the public. Despite calls from some judges and rights activists, the opposition has been unable to marshal any real public protest against the ruling party's moves, reflecting Poles' frustration with a system in which even simple court cases can last years.      Also on Wednesday, PiS passed a bill to give parliament a greater say in appointing district and appellate judges by giving lawmakers the right to choose the majority of members to the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS). [L8N1K353Z]   KRS spokesman Waldemar Zurek told state news agency PAP the moves by PiS lawmakers and the government were a  creeping attack  on the judiciary. PiS lawmakers have previously responded to criticism saying that in several EU countries the executive and legislative powers have a major say in appointing judges, citing the example of Germany where parliament and representatives of states choose members of the constitutional court. The PiS party has brought the prosecutor's office and state media under direct government control. The new bill would further increase the powers of the justice minister, who would also oversee prosecutors.

U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the sale to take place on August 16 will offer leases offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for exploration and development. The sale will be the first of the adminstration's 2017-22 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. Zinke signed an order last week to hold more lease sales and speed up approvals of permits to explore for oil and gas, a process he said got bogged down under former president Barack Obama.  Our Outer Continental Shelf lands offer vast energy development opportunities and we are committed to encouraging increased energy exploration and production in these offshore areas to maintain the country's global dominance in energy production,  Zinke said. The Interior Department said it will lower royalty rates for shallow water leases in the August sale to encourage drilling by oil companies, which have faced lower profits during years of sustained low global crude prices. Energy companies will pay 12.5 percent royalty rates for leases in less than 200 meters (656 feet) of water, instead of a rate of 18.75 percent that had been proposed earlier.  The rate change reflects this Administration's willingness to swiftly respond to economic indicators,  said Vincent DeVito, counselor to Zinke on energy policy.  The 12.5 percent royalty rate is closer in harmony with the current market and federal onshore lease sales,  he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-leasesale-idUSL1N1K4251"},

People are a trying to buy in ahead of tomorrow,  said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for S&P; 500 companies rose 7.8 percent from a year ago, with financials projected to have had the third-best profit growth among sectors, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Over the last seven trading days, investors have more than doubled the amount of cash invested in a key financial sector fund, betting that second-quarter bank earnings will be strong.

This is not a watershed moment like the Affordable Care Act, where it altered the healthcare industry,  he said. Hospital and insurer groups have been vocal against proposed Medicaid cuts which could result in lower revenues for hospitals like Community Health Systems Inc (CYH.N) and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare (MOH.N) and Centene Corp (CNC.N).     Investors are eager to move past the healthcare bill and onto comprehensive tax reform, though Congress's ability to address it soon are in doubt, Cox said. Target Corp (TGT.N) rose 4.8 percent after an upbeat second-quarter forecast. The news boosted other retailers, with Wal-Mart (WMT.N) up 1.5 percent and Costco (COST.O) edging up 1.2 percent.     Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) on Thursday reported a 21 percent drop in second-quarter profit because of sharply higher operating costs, despite higher passenger unit revenue, sending its shares down about 1.8 percent.

Brett McGurk, U.S. special envoy for the coalition against Islamic State, said the United States was  very encouraged  by the progress since the ceasefire arranged by the United States, Russia and Jordan took effect on Sunday.  The Russians have made clear they're very serious about this and willing to put some of their people on the ground to help monitor from the regime side,  McGurk told reporters.  They do not want the regime violating the ceasefire.  Russia is the main backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias have helped put mostly Sunni rebels at a disadvantage over the past year. The wide array of rebels fighting Assad since 2011 includes jihadist factions and other groups supported by the United States, Turkey and Gulf monarchies. The  de-escalation agreement  for southwestern Syria was announced after a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Germany on Friday. Trump, in a news conference in Paris on Thursday, said work was under way to negotiate a ceasefire in a second region of Syria.  I think the president is referring to a very constructive discussion that he had with the Russians in building from this southwest agreement,  McGurk said when asked about Turmp's remark. The United States has had  very constructive ... military-to-military discussions with the Russians about deconfliction arrangements  in recent weeks and is keen to explore the possibility of ceasefires in other areas, he said. McGurk said the United States, Russia and Jordan had conducted extensive discussions to agree on a detailed line of contact as a basis for the southwestern ceasefire, and were now looking at where monitors could be placed.  That discussion is very much ongoing, and I'm hopeful over the next week or so it can get somewhere,  he said. Earlier on Thursday at a meeting of the anti-IS coalition in Washington, McGurk said Washington had pledged an additional $119 million for humanitarian aid in Iraq following the recapture of Mosul from Islamic State this month. He urged efforts and funds to stabilize areas of Iraq and Syria where allied forces had defeated the militants.  We have identified 100 critical stabilization sites in and around Mosul which will be the immediate focus for de-mining and restoration,  McGurk said at the beginning of Thursday meeting. Iraqi forces clashed with Islamic State fighters holding out in Mosul's Old City on Wednesday, more than 36 hours after Baghdad announced victory over the jihadists in what the militant group had declared the de facto Iraqi capital of its  caliphate.  Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's victory announcement signaled the biggest defeat for the hard-line Sunni group since its lightning sweep through northern Iraq three years ago. But pockets of Mosul remain insecure and the city has been heavily damaged by nearly nine months of grueling urban combat.

Following are reactions by statement and on social media from nominees for television's highest honors, which will be handed out on Sept. 17 in a Los Angeles ceremony.  Chuffed, thrilled, proud, honored! So delighted for everyone involved. A proper fat cigar moment, if only I smoked. Drinks all round, if only I drank. I shall have to make do with turning cartwheels.  Peter Morgan, creator of  The Crown   If at first you don’t succeed, try try try try try try try try try try again!  Kevin Spacey, actor,  House of Cards   In a year of such great television it's a privilege to be nominated and having seen my fellow nominees work just to be in their company is winning enough. Couldn't be happier for me and the show.  Benedict Cumberbatch, actor,  Sherlock: The Lying Detective   Wow this is just unbelievable! Thank you so so much to the Academy for this incredible honor and for all the love you gave Stranger Things. We are so proud to be in the company of such inspiring artists.  Matt and Ross Duffer, creators of  Stranger Things   For our show to even be in a general conversation with these other stellar programs - it’s beyond our wildest dreams... it’s so exciting to see such incredibly nice things happen to such incredibly nice people.  Dan Fogelman, creator of  This is Us   Well I'm in a little bit of shock!! 13 nominations is absolutely insane. I woke up to a gif from my publicist Erica of a shirtless Anthony Rizzo from the Cubs and knew it was good news (because a shirtless Rizzo is always good news) but 13 is blowing my mind!...  Elisabeth Moss, actor,  The Handmaid's Tale   Thanks and congratulations to our voice, our creator — Margaret Atwood. Brilliant, dauntless, hilarious, and generous, she is our guiding light. Margaret, you make us all brave.    Don’t let the bastards grind you down.  Bruce Miller, executive producer  The Handmaid's Tale  “When we started on this journey we never thought the series would connect on such a big way worldwide. I have never experienced anything like it and as producers and actors we all bow down to the Academy with thanks!” Nicole Kidman, actor and executive producer,  Big Little Lies   Every day working with this incredible cast and crew is a dream (and not one of those dreams where you wake up being operated on by guys in a glass basement). But it's a special thrill today to see all of the amazing people who worked so hard on this show recognized in such an extraordinary fashion!  Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, creators of  Westworld   Almost four years into this journey... it's such a thrill to have the collective efforts of our talented cast, crew, designers, directors and writers recognized by the Television Academy.  Beau Willimon, executive producer,  House of Cards   The news of this nom at 1:38 a.m. in the Antipodes is wonderful. For me it is not only a celebration of having failed so badly in Physics at High School, but also great for Nat Geo entering a new playing field and bringing Einstein and the crucial value of scientific questioning into the spotlight.  Geoffrey Rush, actor,  Genius   I am beyond honored and grateful for the nominations for FEUD; this was a great year for women’s stories on television and it’s moving and affirming to see Emmy voters recognizing so much good work. It’s a proud day for all of us who worked on this series but an even prouder day for this medium which I love. How lucky are we to be a part of it?” Ryan Murphy, executive producer,  Feud: Bette and Joan   We are elated to still be even mentioned in this conversation after so many years. Knowing this is for our eighth season, I was prepared for a depressing morning (both my shrink and Bloody Mary ingredients were on standby) so now I don’t know what to do with myself.  Steven Levitan, executive producer,  Modern Family   I am so honored to be included in this extraordinary group of women. And I am very grateful to Robert, Tina, and all of our cast and crew who make my job so pleasant. Go Russia! I mean, go USA!” Ellie Kemper, actor,  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt   Ahhhh!

For Handmaid's to now receive this much recognition, it's humbling, yet I'm so proud, and really excited for everyone.  Alexis Bledel, actor,  The Handmaid's Tale   I love bringing Jimmy Mcgill/Saul to life. As written by Peter Gould and Vince Gilligan and the staff, he's a complex, compromised, and funny fella – he's got everything going on! It is the part of a lifetime, and I'm glad it's working so well for so many people.  Bob Odenkirk, actor,  Better Call Saul   I am delighted that 'The Night Of' was acknowledged across the board in so many different categories. I am proud to be a part of this talented team from Steve, Richard, James, Riz, Bill, Michael and HBO.

U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the sale to take place on August 16 will offer leases offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for exploration and development. The sale will be the first of the adminstration's 2017-22 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. Zinke signed an order last week to hold more lease sales and speed up approvals of permits to explore for oil and gas, a process he said got bogged down under former president Barack Obama.  Our Outer Continental Shelf lands offer vast energy development opportunities and we are committed to encouraging increased energy exploration and production in these offshore areas to maintain the country's global dominance in energy production,  Zinke said. The Interior Department said it will lower royalty rates for shallow water leases in the August sale to encourage drilling by oil companies, which have faced lower profits during years of sustained low global crude prices. Energy companies will pay 12.5 percent royalty rates for leases in less than 200 meters (656 feet) of water, instead of a rate of 18.75 percent that had been proposed earlier.  The rate change reflects this Administration's willingness to swiftly respond to economic indicators,  said Vincent DeVito, counselor to Zinke on energy policy.  The 12.5 percent royalty rate is closer in harmony with the current market and federal onshore lease sales,  he said.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika wrote Cordray on Monday to raise  safety and soundness  concerns with a draft version of the CFPB rule, which bars firms from forcing customers to settle disputes only through arbitration. The CFPB issued the final version later that day. Noreika's letter clears the way to invoke an untested legal provision where the council of the country's top financial regulators - called the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) - can nullify a CFPB rule that significantly risks injuring the banking system. The Republican president's picks to head the Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission belong to FSOC alongside Noreika. Since the CFPB opened its doors six years ago, Republican policymakers have hammered it as unconstitutional and attacked Cordray, a Democrat, for exceeding limits on his power.  Cordray is not the only holdover regulator from Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration - but he is the most vulnerable. A court ruled last year that the president should be able to fire him at will. While the CFPB appeals that decision, Republicans are increasing attacks and more frequently Cordray is standing up to them.  There is no basis for claiming that the arbitration rule puts the federal banking system at risk,  Cordray wrote Noreika in a three-page letter accompanied by a five-page, detailed memo on Wednesday. Reuters received copies of the memo on Thursday. Any FSOC attempt to overturn the rule  would be subject to a legal challenge,  according to the memo. The Dodd-Frank financial reform law says an FSOC member must work in good faith to resolve concerns with a rule before seeking to kill it, and Cordray contends the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) did not. The OCC did not mention the concerns during meetings in 2015, 2016 or 2017, and on June 26 said it had no comments on the draft, Cordray wrote. The OCC had no comment on the correspondence. To overturn a CFPB rule, two-thirds of the FSOC must agree that it puts the whole banking system at risk. “It’s an extraordinarily high standard,” said Brian Marshall, policy counsel for Americans for Financial Reform, a Washington-based advocacy group.  It's ludicrous that the arbitration rule would meet that standard.

The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's all-new Camry launching this month, is expected to offer major improvements in fuel economy, technology, styling and safety, according to Honda's U.S. dealers. Honda declined to discuss details ahead of Friday's event in Detroit. The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. Both are popular marques that will be promoted heavily.  There has been no new news on the midsize sedan side for three years and we think this is a great opportunity to bring attention back to the segment,  said Jack Hollis, Toyota's head of marketing for North America. Year to date, U.S. passenger car sales are down 11.4 percent and sales of midsize sedans are down 14.2 percent. Still, Americans bought 7.1 million sedans in 2016. With General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said.  They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched,  said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc, the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group.  Not Finding a Place With Consumers  The Accord for years was Honda's top-selling model in the United States. Within the past year, U.S. sales of the Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle have eclipsed the aging Accord as Honda has expanded production capacity for the former. Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans have sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year. IHS Markit said U.S. consumer loyalty to SUVs and pickup trucks has risen since 2012, but declined for sedans. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2tNZJ9J) The new Accord and Camry  may stem the decline,  said IHS Markit's Tom Libby.  I don't think they will cause a marked reverse.  Improvements to the Accord should boost sales at Galpin Honda in San Fernando, California, general manager Ed Hartoonian said. The dealership sells about 500 Accords and Civics, combined, per month and Accord sales are up nearly 13 percent so far this year, he said.  As a dealer we can't ask for much more.

Last year's report forecast the program would remain solvent only through 2028 and predicted that spending levels in 2017 would likely trigger the creation of an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to automatically rein in costs. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at a press conference that Social Security and Medicare  are secure and will remain secure,  though officials acknowledged that long-term shortfalls due to an aging population and tepid economic growth were  alarming.  Healthcare investors breathed a sigh of relief that the advisory board, a provision contained in the Affordable Care Act, will not be triggered since its theoretical capacity to cut Medicare's pharmaceuticals bill could have been used as a bargaining chip to extract price concessions.  While this may still be the case in the future, there is also a good chance that IPAB will be dismantled altogether in future, eliminating this risk in its entirety,  Tim Anderson, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a research note. Under the controversial measure, a 15-member panel, or the Health and Human Services Department if a panel could not be convened, would recommend cost-cutting measures. Congress could either pass the recommendations or enact alternative legislation to achieve similar savings. If Congress failed to act, the administration's proposals in theory could be enacted through regulation.  The IPAB provision  is almost unanimously loathed by both parties in Congress, and an abbreviated legislative process for circumventing the mechanism this year is already underway,  Rob Smith, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, said in a research note. Last July's report predicted the IPAB would likely be triggered in 2017 and that a 0.2 percent, or roughly $1.3 billion spending cut would be needed to bring program costs back into line. The combined Social Security trust funds covering benefits for the elderly and disability insurance could be depleted by 2034, the same level as projected last year according to the trustees, in part because of lower disability claims and fewer payouts.

The Republican proposals to repeal and replace the U.S. Affordable Care Act (ACA) would be a disaster for older Americans not yet on Medicare - but they also endanger Medicare itself. The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) under consideration in the U.S. Senate would mean higher premiums and reduced cost-sharing subsidies for lower-income older people. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated, for example, that under this bill the annual premium for a 64-year-old person who earns $56,800 would skyrocket by $13,700. And the Medicaid cuts will put the squeeze on states’ ability to fund long-term care (reut.rs/2tfvvZt). Meanwhile, tax cuts for the wealthy contained in some of the Republican proposals would bring closer the projected insolvency date of the Medicare Part A trust fund, which pays for hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice benefits. Insolvency would require either a new revenue source or a reduction of healthcare services the program provides. The trustees of Medicare and Social Security released their respective annual reports on Thursday on the health of the programs. The news about the Part A trust fund was encouraging: the Medicare report said that lower-than-expected program spending in 2016 has pushed out the predicted date of insolvency for the Hospital Insurance Trust fund by one additional year, to 2029.  But the Republican reform efforts could worsen that outlook. The American Health Care Act approved by the House of Representatives in March would repeal the Medicare payroll surtax on high-income workers, which was added under the ACA to shore up the hospital insurance trust fund. The first version of the BCRA also repealed the payroll surtax.  On Thursday, however, Senate Republicans scrambling to save their struggling proposal unveiled a new version that would keep the tax - along with the net investment income tax. That tax imposes a 3.8 percent surtax on investment income for joint filers with more than $250,000 of adjusted gross income (AGI), and single filers with more than $200,000 of AGI. (Receipts from the investment tax go into the federal government’s general revenue coffers.) Both of these tax cuts could easily reappear as the horse trading continues. So it is worthwhile to consider how elimination of the payroll surcharge, in particular, could damage Medicare’s financial health. Medicare taps funding from several different sources. Part B (outpatient services) and Part D (prescription drugs) receive  about three-quarters of their funding from general federal revenue, with the remainder coming from beneficiary premiums. Their financing is adequate into the indefinite future because the programs rely on these flexible revenue sources. Meanwhile, Part A is financed almost entirely by payroll taxes. Workers and employees each pay 1.45 percent of wages into the fund; the ACA increased the tax for taxpayers earning more than $200,000 (individual) and $250,000 (joint filers) by 0.9 percentage point.  Rising Cost Pressure Medicare faces rising enrollment - and financial pressure - due to the retirement of the baby boomer generation. The number of enrollees is projected to rise from 57 million in 2016 to nearly 90 million by 2040, according to the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI). At the same time, the rising tide of boomer retirements means that the workforce paying Part A payroll taxes is growing more slowly. Rising healthcare costs also play an important role. The price of healthcare has been rising at about double the rate of general inflation. The solvency threat applies only to Part A, due to its reliance on the payroll tax. The trustees’ projected insolvency date has fluctuated a great deal over time; since 1970, it has been as close as two years away, and as distant as 28 years, according to NASI. Today’s projection is in the middle of those ranges. In 2009 - just before enactment of the ACA - the Medicare trustees forecast that insolvency was just eight years away. When the ACA passed, that number jumped to 19 years - due in part to the payroll tax surcharge but also reductions in payments to Medicare Advantage providers and to healthcare providers. Since then, the number has drawn somewhat closer. The ACA’s payroll surtax has provided a shot in the arm to the hospital insurance trust fund; repealing it would move up the projected insolvency date by a full two years, from 2028 to 2026, according to the CBO. The term “insolvency” does not mean bankruptcy for a government programme like Medicare. Instead, it would mean Medicare would have sufficient resources to pay only 88 percent of promised benefits. The shortfall would have to be closed by raising new revenue, slowing growth in spending, or both. And Republican leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan routinely toss around insolvency as a justification for schemes to further privatize Medicare by sending seniors into an insurance marketplace with vouchers to buy coverage.  “It’s an open question what would happen,” said Juliette Cubanski, associate director of the programme on Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “We’ve gotten close to it a couple times, but it’s never happened - and there is no statutory language governing a situation where the trust fund has no assets and insufficient funding to pay benefits. The spectre of it is daunting.” Editing by Matthew Lewis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/column-miller-medicare-idUSL1N1K421O"},

Last year's report forecast the program would remain solvent only through 2028 and predicted that spending levels in 2017 would likely trigger the creation of an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to automatically rein in costs. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at a press conference that Social Security and Medicare  are secure and will remain secure,  though officials acknowledged that long-term shortfalls due to an aging population and tepid economic growth were  alarming.  Healthcare investors breathed a sigh of relief that the advisory board, a provision contained in the Affordable Care Act, will not be triggered since its theoretical capacity to cut Medicare's pharmaceuticals bill could have been used as a bargaining chip to extract price concessions.  While this may still be the case in the future, there is also a good chance that IPAB will be dismantled altogether in future, eliminating this risk in its entirety,  Tim Anderson, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a research note. Under the controversial measure, a 15-member panel, or the Health and Human Services Department if a panel could not be convened, would recommend cost-cutting measures. Congress could either pass the recommendations or enact alternative legislation to achieve similar savings. If Congress failed to act, the administration's proposals in theory could be enacted through regulation.  The IPAB provision  is almost unanimously loathed by both parties in Congress, and an abbreviated legislative process for circumventing the mechanism this year is already underway,  Rob Smith, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, said in a research note. Last July's report predicted the IPAB would likely be triggered in 2017 and that a 0.2 percent, or roughly $1.3 billion spending cut would be needed to bring program costs back into line. The combined Social Security trust funds covering benefits for the elderly and disability insurance could be depleted by 2034, the same level as projected last year according to the trustees, in part because of lower disability claims and fewer payouts.

By Mark Miller CHICAGO, July 13 (Reuters) - The Republican proposals to repeal and replace the U.S. Affordable Care Act (ACA) would be a disaster for older Americans not yet on Medicare - but they also endanger Medicare itself. The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) under consideration in the U.S. Senate would mean higher premiums and reduced cost-sharing subsidies for lower-income older people. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated, for example, that under this bill the annual premium for a 64-year-old person who earns $56,800 would skyrocket by $13,700. And the Medicaid cuts will put the squeeze on states’ ability to fund long-term care (reut.rs/2tfvvZt). Meanwhile, tax cuts for the wealthy contained in some of the Republican proposals would bring closer the projected insolvency date of the Medicare Part A trust fund, which pays for hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice benefits. Insolvency would require either a new revenue source or a reduction of healthcare services the program provides. The trustees of Medicare and Social Security released their respective annual reports on Thursday on the health of the programs. The news about the Part A trust fund was encouraging: the Medicare report said that lower-than-expected program spending in 2016 has pushed out the predicted date of insolvency for the Hospital Insurance Trust fund by one additional year, to 2029. But the Republican reform efforts could worsen that outlook. The American Health Care Act approved by the House of Representatives in March would repeal the Medicare payroll surtax on high-income workers, which was added under the ACA to shore up the hospital insurance trust fund. The first version of the BCRA also repealed the payroll surtax. On Thursday, however, Senate Republicans scrambling to save their struggling proposal unveiled a new version that would keep the tax - along with the net investment income tax. That tax imposes a 3.8 percent surtax on investment income for joint filers with more than $250,000 of adjusted gross income (AGI), and single filers with more than $200,000 of AGI. (Receipts from the investment tax go into the federal government’s general revenue coffers.) Both of these tax cuts could easily reappear as the horse trading continues. So it is worthwhile to consider how elimination of the payroll surcharge, in particular, could damage Medicare’s financial health. Medicare taps funding from several different sources. Part B (outpatient services) and Part D (prescription drugs) receive about three-quarters of their funding from general federal revenue, with the remainder coming from beneficiary premiums. Their financing is adequate into the indefinite future because the programs rely on these flexible revenue sources. Meanwhile, Part A is financed almost entirely by payroll taxes. Workers and employees each pay 1.45 percent of wages into the fund; the ACA increased the tax for taxpayers earning more than $200,000 (individual) and $250,000 (joint filers) by 0.9 percentage point. Rising Cost Pressure Medicare faces rising enrollment - and financial pressure - due to the retirement of the baby boomer generation. The number of enrollees is projected to rise from 57 million in 2016 to nearly 90 million by 2040, according to the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI). At the same time, the rising tide of boomer retirements means that the workforce paying Part A payroll taxes is growing more slowly. Rising healthcare costs also play an important role. The price of healthcare has been rising at about double the rate of general inflation. The solvency threat applies only to Part A, due to its reliance on the payroll tax.

The ACA’s payroll surtax has provided a shot in the arm to the hospital insurance trust fund; repealing it would move up the projected insolvency date by a full two years, from 2028 to 2026, according to the CBO.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika wrote Cordray on Monday to raise  safety and soundness  concerns with a draft version of the CFPB rule, which bars firms from forcing customers to settle disputes only through arbitration. The CFPB issued the final version later that day. Noreika's letter clears the way to invoke an untested legal provision where the council of the country's top financial regulators - called the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) - can nullify a CFPB rule that significantly risks injuring the banking system. The Republican president's picks to head the Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission belong to FSOC alongside Noreika. Since the CFPB opened its doors six years ago, Republican policymakers have hammered it as unconstitutional and attacked Cordray, a Democrat, for exceeding limits on his power.  Cordray is not the only holdover regulator from Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration - but he is the most vulnerable. A court ruled last year that the president should be able to fire him at will. While the CFPB appeals that decision, Republicans are increasing attacks and more frequently Cordray is standing up to them.  There is no basis for claiming that the arbitration rule puts the federal banking system at risk,  Cordray wrote Noreika in a three-page letter accompanied by a five-page, detailed memo on Wednesday. Reuters received copies of the memo on Thursday. Any FSOC attempt to overturn the rule  would be subject to a legal challenge,  according to the memo. The Dodd-Frank financial reform law says an FSOC member must work in good faith to resolve concerns with a rule before seeking to kill it, and Cordray contends the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) did not. The OCC did not mention the concerns during meetings in 2015, 2016 or 2017, and on June 26 said it had no comments on the draft, Cordray wrote. The OCC had no comment on the correspondence. To overturn a CFPB rule, two-thirds of the FSOC must agree that it puts the whole banking system at risk. “It’s an extraordinarily high standard,” said Brian Marshall, policy counsel for Americans for Financial Reform, a Washington-based advocacy group.  It's ludicrous that the arbitration rule would meet that standard.

See the image here: reut.rs/2uoksCt The Briton will be back on Thursday as the focus of attention, bidding to match his late compatriot Jim Clark as the only driver to have won four British Grands Prix in a row and five in total. The triple world champion is in need of home comforts after setbacks beyond his control in Azerbaijan and Austria left him 20 points behind Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel as the season approaches the halfway stage. For the first time since March 2014 Hamilton has been off the podium for two successive races and he has no intention of completing that hat-trick at a circuit that ranks among his favorites.  It is generally when there are adversities that there is an opportunity to grow and to do something pretty special,  he said of his current situation, while recognizing that things did not look great as they stood.  We've still got a long, long way to go. It could easily, within one race, switch. But the bigger that gap gets, the more pressure builds.  Vettel, like Hamilton, has won three races so far this season and will be looking for Ferrari's first win in Britain since Fernando Alonso in 2011.

The Berlin-based start-up is different from rivals Apple, Spotify and Amazon in that it relies more on amateur musicians, for whom it provides a rare platform, and less on major commercial artists. But like them, it has yet to turn a profit. The big music labels on which most of the services depend - themselves under pressure from the shift to digital music - strike hard bargains. And SoundCloud - which said three years ago it had an audience of 175 million, a figure it has not updated - lacks either Spotify's large base of paying subscribers or the deep pockets of Apple and Amazon that can subsidize their music services.   Last week, SoundCloud said it was firing 173 staffers and closing its London and San Francisco offices to focus on Berlin and New York.  We're on our path to profitability and in control of SoundCloud's independent future,  co-founder Alex Ljung wrote in a blog post. Technology website TechCrunch reported, however, that staff were told at a meeting this week that the layoffs only saved the company enough cash to hold out until the fourth quarter. A spokeswoman the SoundCloud declined to comment on the TechCrunch article in depth. She did say,  SoundCloud is fully funded into the fourth quarter. We continue to be confident the changes made last week put us on our path to profitability and ensure SoundCloud’s long-term viability.   She declined to comment on funding beyond the end of the year.  The news has reignited speculation that SoundCloud will be acquired by a rival. It was targeted by Spotify last year in a bid that was later aborted. Spotify, recently valued at $13 billion, is now planning a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year or in early 2018, sources told Reuters in May.  The biggest problem I see is that the financial problems will absorb much of management's time in trying to raise more money, meaning that the real problems of the business go unaddressed,  independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note.  Of all the potential suitors, I think Google makes the most sense,  he said, noting SoundCloud's similarity to Google's YouTube in its focus on user-generated content.  Google will probably be most able to monetize what SoundCloud cannot.  SoundCloud, which was launched in 2008 and has never said how many paying subscribers it has, last month launched a budget subscription package in the hope of persuading more listeners to convert from the free service. SoundCloud raised $100 million last June from a group of investors including Twitter, valuing the company at roughly $700 million, according to Re/code. In March, it raised a further $70 million in debt from Ares Capital, Kreos Capital and Davidson Technology to meet its expected 2.5 times year-on-year revenue growth in 2017, a company spokeswoman said.

The Berlin-based start-up is different from rivals Apple, Spotify and Amazon in that it relies more on amateur musicians, for whom it provides a rare platform, and less on major commercial artists. But like them, it has yet to turn a profit. The big music labels on which most of the services depend - themselves under pressure from the shift to digital music - strike hard bargains. And SoundCloud - which said three years ago it had an audience of 175 million, a figure it has not updated - lacks either Spotify's large base of paying subscribers or the deep pockets of Apple and Amazon that can subsidize their music services.   Last week, SoundCloud said it was firing 173 staffers and closing its London and San Francisco offices to focus on Berlin and New York.  We're on our path to profitability and in control of SoundCloud's independent future,  co-founder Alex Ljung wrote in a blog post. Technology website TechCrunch reported, however, that staff were told at a meeting this week that the layoffs only saved the company enough cash to hold out until the fourth quarter. A spokeswoman the SoundCloud declined to comment on the TechCrunch article in depth. She did say,  SoundCloud is fully funded into the fourth quarter. We continue to be confident the changes made last week put us on our path to profitability and ensure SoundCloud’s long-term viability.   She declined to comment on funding beyond the end of the year.  The news has reignited speculation that SoundCloud will be acquired by a rival. It was targeted by Spotify last year in a bid that was later aborted. Spotify, recently valued at $13 billion, is now planning a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year or in early 2018, sources told Reuters in May.  The biggest problem I see is that the financial problems will absorb much of management's time in trying to raise more money, meaning that the real problems of the business go unaddressed,  independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note.  Of all the potential suitors, I think Google makes the most sense,  he said, noting SoundCloud's similarity to Google's YouTube in its focus on user-generated content.  Google will probably be most able to monetize what SoundCloud cannot.  SoundCloud, which was launched in 2008 and has never said how many paying subscribers it has, last month launched a budget subscription package in the hope of persuading more listeners to convert from the free service. SoundCloud raised $100 million last June from a group of investors including Twitter, valuing the company at roughly $700 million, according to Re/code. In March, it raised a further $70 million in debt from Ares Capital, Kreos Capital and Davidson Technology to meet its expected 2.5 times year-on-year revenue growth in 2017, a company spokeswoman said.

Form SF-86, required for government employees working in national security, indicated Sessions has had no immediate contact with any foreign government or its representatives in the past seven years. However, Sessions has said he met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A large portion of the document was left blank. “As a United States Senator, the Attorney General met hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign dignitaries and their staff. In filling out the SF-86 form, the Attorney General’s staff consulted with those familiar with the process, as well as the FBI investigator handling the background check, and was instructed not to list meetings with foreign dignitaries and their staff connected with his Senate activities,  said Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior. Sessions released the form in response to a lawsuit filed by American Oversight, a group that advocates for government transparency and sued DOJ in April after the extent of Sessions' contact with the Russian government was called into question.  Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, said the form was evidence that Sessions lied to the FBI investigators overseeing his security clearance.  Jeff Sessions is our nation's top law enforcement officer, and it is shocking one of his first acts after being named Attorney General was to lie to the FBI on an issue of national security,  Evers said.  Sessions recused himself from the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the election after media reports revealed he held undisclosed meetings with Kislyak. Sessions admitted to having the interactions, but said they were held in his capacity as a U.S. senator, a position he occupied for 20 years before becoming attorney general.  Former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired in May, testified that his agency had information on Sessions that would lead them to believe his continued involvement in the federal probe would be  problematic.  It was later reported that Sessions had another undisclosed interaction with Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington in April 2016. Sessions told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he had no recollection of the interaction.  Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is now leading the investigation into Russian meddling in the election.

The market is trying to stabilize,  said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy.  Prices had responded only minimally to data Wednesday showing U.S. crude oil inventories dropped last week by the most in 10 months.  The market is having difficulty picking its head up,  McGillian said.  Oil prices have dropped in recent weeks to levels not seen since the end of last year as investors lost faith in a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to reduce output, while U.S. shale oil production has risen sharply. But there is evidence world oil demand is picking up, notably in the United States and China, the world's two biggest oil consumers. China imported 8.55 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in the first half of this year, up 13.8 percent from the same period in 2016, making it the world's biggest crude importer ahead of the United States.  We are definitely seeing robust demand growth (in China),  said Neil Beveridge, senior oil analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Rising demand is helping to drain a global fuel glut but rebalancing of the market is taking longer than anticipated. The IEA said the oil market could stay oversupplied for longer than expected due to rising production and limited output cuts by some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Each month something seems to come along to raise doubts about the pace of the rebalancing process,  the IEA report said.   This month, there are two hitches: a dramatic recovery in oil production from Libya and Nigeria and a lower rate of compliance by OPEC with its own output agreement.  Oil inventories in industrialized nations remain high despite a modest drop in May. OECD stocks are still 266 million barrels above the five-year average, the IEA said. OPEC said on Wednesday the world would need only 32.2 million bpd of its crude next year, down 60,000 bpd from this year and about 400,000 bpd less than it pumped in June.  OPEC has promised to curb production by about 1.2 million bpd between January this year and March 2018, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers say they will hold back half as much.

Common Cause, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Public Knowledge and other groups echoed other critics of the deal, including some lawmakers, who say that the $85.4 billion deal would give AT&T;, owner of DirecTV, the ability to withhold Time Warner's content from other outlets and hurt the move to show television shows and movies on the Internet. The groups argued that after buying Time Warner, owner of HBO and TNT, AT&T; would have the incentive to restrict sales of that programming to cable and online channels. That could hurt DirecTV's rivals as well as AT&T;'s competitors in providing video online, the letter said. The groups also worried that the deal would create incentives for AT&T; to refrain from showing independent programmers. The groups said that the deal  poses ... grave dangers to consumers and creators in mature and emerging markets  and urged the government to consider stopping it.  If you conclude, as appears to us from the available information, that conditions and piecemeal divestitures will not be sufficient, then we hope you will challenge the merger in its entirety,  the groups said in their letter to Sessions. Aside from the Justice Department's antitrust review, the deal is at the center of a controversy over allegations that White House advisers considered using the probe as political leverage.

The concept that energy firms and their investors will take big hits as carbon-generating forms of energy face regulation to cap climate change has had much attention, notably via warnings to long-term investors and others by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. The idea is that energy reserves, be it coal, oil or gas, now valued by energy companies as exploitable will in the end be made uneconomic by regulation, or allied technological change. These so-called “stranded assets” would then be a loss to investors, who’ve previously assigned a large value to them. That, obviously, is an analysis which depends in substantial part on the doubtful prospect of successful coordinated official intervention to assist in a move away from fossil fuels. A May report from think tank RethinkX, founded by Stanford economist Tony Seba, lays out a more radical case, in which the convergence of the use of autonomous and electric vehicles absolutely eviscerates huge swaths of the sunk costs of industries from energy to automobiles. “By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of fully autonomous vehicles, 95 percent of all U.S. passenger miles will be served by transport-as-a-service (TaaS) providers who will own and operate fleets of autonomous electric vehicles providing passengers with higher levels of service, faster rides and vastly increased safety at a cost up to 10 times cheaper than today’s individually owned (IO) vehicles,” according to the report.  ( www.rethinkx.com/ ) If true, a big if, this implies U.S. oil demand will peak at 100 million barrels a day in 2020, but drop by 30 percent over the next decade, taking the per barrel cost down to $25. Because those cars in use will be used ten times more, rather than sitting idly in garages, demand for vehicles will tumble even as miles traveled rises. Car manufacturing revenue will fall to less than 20 percent of 2015 levels by 2030. The value of oil burned by cars will fall to about 7.0 percent of today’s levels, according to the study. To be sure, the RethinkX report reaches optimistic conclusions about the rate of adaptation, though it says its base case is derived solely from existing technology. Not a Low Volatility Scenario In the RethinkX scenario, the overall economic impact will be positive. Cheaper transport will put $1 trillion a year more into consumer pockets, and presuming we do useful stuff in the time not driving, productivity gains will add another $1 trillion. As someone who has spent too much time in cars, ferrying children and commuting, this all sounds great, if optimistic, but from the point of view of investment portfolio construction it would represent a seemingly unprecedented risk. Not only is this transformation supposed to happen on a much tighter timeline than the one from buggy and rail to automobile, but the sunk costs of the existing infrastructure, supply chains and jobs is a much bigger part of the economy. Many of those people who used to grow our food have seen their labor absorbed in the transport industry, broadly defined, which represents a staggering investment in existing capital. “In the U.S., an estimated 65 percent of shale oil and tight oil — which under a “business as usual” scenario could make up over 70 percent of the U.S. supply in 2030 — would no longer be commercially viable,” according to the report. Car manufacturing revenue will fall to less than 20 percent of 2015 levels by 2030, as those cars which are bought do more service thus leading to a need for fewer units. The impact on  supply chains, natural resource use and commodity markets may make the crisis faced by the auto industry during the Great Recession look tame. The insurance industry will be in the line of fire both as a provider of services and as a long-term investor in industries hurt by the changes. Automated cars will have far fewer accidents, the study argues, leading revenue to insurance companies from car travel to fall by more than 70 percent in the 15 years to 2030. Those same insurance companies also own a lot of the debt and equity of companies which will be hurt by this transformation. Used car sales are forecast to fall from $111 billion a year in 2015 to nothing in 2030, which will certainly hurt the value of some asset-backed debt, to put it mildly.Think too about the entire travel hospitality ecosystem; fewer nights in roadside hotels, fewer nights perhaps in city-center hotels if travelers choose to return home via overnight trips. Many of these assumptions will doubtless prove far off the mark, or even possibly wrong, but it strikes me that with the exception of some pie-in-sky valuations for companies like Tesla, the overall market is a long way from discounting the potential price and volatility effects of a positive, but hugely disruptive set of changes. Winners there will be, but it looks as if the next couple of decades will not see the same downturn in volatility we’ve recently enjoyed.

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced victory over Islamic State in Mosul on Monday, three years after the militants seized the city and made it the stronghold of a  caliphate  they said would take over the world. Iraq's government now faces the task of preventing revenge attacks against people associated with Islamic State that could, along with Sunni-Shi'ite sectarian tensions, undermine efforts to create long-term stability in the country.  Iraqi authorities shouldn’t punish entire families because of their relatives' actions,  said Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch (HRW).  These abusive acts are war crimes and are sabotaging efforts to promote reconciliation in areas retaken from ISIS (Islamic State).  Speaking with reporters in Washington, an Iraqi military spokesman said he was not aware of the specific cases but denied that Iraqi forces relocated families by force.  This topic, we didn't have precise information about what is going on, however there is no situation or scenario where the Iraqi forces will forcefully get people out of their homes as Iraqi citizens,  Brigadier General Yahya Rasool, a spokesman for the joint operations command, said through a translator.  However, we try to secure safe pathways for them to avoid the battle area,  Rasool added. The HRW statement said the camp, which Iraqi authorities have described as meant for  rehabilitation , amounted to a detention center for adults and children who have not been accused of any wrongdoing. Fakih called on the families to be allowed to go where they can live safely. HRW said forced displacements and arbitrary detentions taking place in Anbar, Babel, Diyala, Salahuddin and Nineveh provinces had affected hundreds of families. It said Iraqi security and military forces had done little to stop the abuses and in some instances participated in them. The group said it had visited the Bartalla camp and interviewed 14 families, each with up to 18 members.  New residents said that Iraqi Security Forces had brought the families to the camp and that the police were holding them against their will because of accusations that they had relatives linked to ISIS,  the HRW statement said. It cited medical workers at the camp who said at least 10 women and children had died traveling to or at the camp, most because of dehydration. Facebook Video Separately, HRW said it had used satellite imagery to verify that a video published on Facebook on Tuesday, showing armed men in military uniforms beating a detainee before throwing him from a height and then shooting at him, had been filmed in west Mosul. The footage shows the men shooting at the body of another man already lying at the bottom of the perch. Rasool, from the joint operations command, said that the allegations were being looked at closely and if any violations were found, those responsible would be held accountable.  He added that the videos could have been fabricated by  those who would like to reduce the joy and the confidence we have from this victory.  Interior Ministry spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan told Al-Hadath television channel that rights abuses were unacceptable and the video needed to be investigated. But he said he was  surprised by the promotion of videos that affect civil peace in Mosul . Speaking with reporters in Washington later, he said that a number of people had been suspended.

The concept that energy firms and their investors will take big hits as carbon-generating forms of energy face regulation to cap climate change has had much attention, notably via warnings to long-term investors and others by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. The idea is that energy reserves, be it coal, oil or gas, now valued by energy companies as exploitable will in the end be made uneconomic by regulation, or allied technological change. These so-called “stranded assets” would then be a loss to investors, who’ve previously assigned a large value to them. That, obviously, is an analysis which depends in substantial part on the doubtful prospect of successful coordinated official intervention to assist in a move away from fossil fuels.

The warning followed an attack in May by Islamic State on Copts traveling to a monastery in central Egypt that killed 29 people. A month earlier, 44 people were killed in bomb attacks at a cathedral and another church on Palm Sunday.  Sources said the warning was given to individual church leaders by a representative of the Coptic Orthodox Pope. Copts on trips or youth camps had been told to cut short their activities and return home early. The Egyptian Catholic church said it got the same instructions. The church  complied with the interior minister's decision to cancel church trips and camps until further notice,  Father Rafik Greish, a spokesman for the Coptic Catholic Church, told Reuters late on Thursday. A Coptic church official, who spoke on condition of  anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, told Reuters that his church received  oral instructions this week, nothing written, to prevent panic,  he said. The source said the church was provided with more security forces to secure the gates of the church this week.  Egypt faces an Islamist insurgency led by the Islamic State group in the Sinai Peninsula, where hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since 2013. At least 23 soldiers were killed last week when suicide car bombs tore through two military checkpoints in the region in an attack claimed by Islamic State. It was one of the bloodiest assaults on security forces in years. But Islamic State has also intensified attacks in the mainland in recent months, often targeting Coptic Christians. About 100 Copts have been killed since December.

Television is proving an embarrassment of riches for women thanks to complex, original characters and female-centric plots that are attracting Oscar-caliber movie stars to the small screen. Once regarded as the step child to Hollywood movies, A-list actors like Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon and Susan Sarandon are flocking to TV series, and jostling for this year's Emmy awards. And there's more to come. Oscar winners Julia Roberts and Penelope Cruz have their first big TV series lined up for next year, while five-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams is due to return to the small screen for the first time since 2005 as the star of HBO's  Sharp Objects.   There is no stigma attached to doing TV anymore, given the opportunities and the writers who are working in television,  said Debra Birnbaum, executive editor of television at Variety.  There is great storytelling with multi-layered, dimensional, rich characters and real women,  she said. While women have long complained about the paucity of good parts for women in Hollywood movies, this year's female Emmy nominees read like a Who's Who of acting.  Feud: Bette and Joan,  starring Jessica Lange and Sarandon as Hollywood movie rivals Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, is seen by awards pundits in a close race for the limited series Emmy in September with  Big Little Lies,  a murder mystery against a backdrop of wife battering, adultery, rape and female rivalry.  This was a great year for women's stories on television and it's moving and affirming to see Emmy voters recognizing so much good work,  said Ryan Murphy, creator of  Feud,  after the show won 18 Emmy nominations on Thursday.  Big Little Lies,  stars Emmy nominees Kidman, Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern in a tale of female rivalry and sisterhood in which men take a decidedly back seat. It was picked up and produced by Kidman, 50, an Oscar winner for  The Hours,  and Witherspoon, 41, who took home the Academy Award in 2006 for  Walk the Line,  as their first starring roles in series television.  When we started on this journey we never thought the series would connect on such a big way worldwide,  Kidman said on Thursday. The show has 16 Emmy nominations. This year's best actress contenders also include Elisabeth Moss in the chilling TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood's  The Handmaid's Tale,  Claire Foy as a young Queen Elizabeth II in  The Crown,  and Viola Davis as a flawed criminal attorney in  How To Get Away with Murder.  Madeline Di Nonno, chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, said it was  inspiring to see such a full spectrum of female characters that are flawed and very relatable.  That's partly a result of the sheer number of television programs now on offer -- around 400 scripted shows -- and the creative freedom offered by disruptors like streaming services Amazon, Netflix and Hulu, who have upended the traditional broadcast model with bold, commercial-free content. Di Nonno said it's also due to concrete steps by veteran TV showrunners like Murphy, Shonda Rhimes, and Melissa Rosenberg to hire more female writers, directors and women behind the camera.  It excites me to see such rich roles for women on television,  said Birnbaum.  Emmy voters definitely have their work cut out.

Common Cause, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Public Knowledge and other groups echoed other critics of the deal, including some lawmakers, who say that the $85.4 billion deal would give AT&T; (T.N), owner of DirecTV, the ability to withhold Time Warner's (TWX.N) content from other outlets and hurt the move to show television shows and movies on the Internet. The groups argued that after buying Time Warner, owner of HBO and TNT, AT&T; would have the incentive to restrict sales of that programming to cable and online channels. That could hurt DirecTV's rivals as well as AT&T;'s competitors in providing video online, the letter said. The groups also worried that the deal would create incentives for AT&T; to refrain from showing independent programmers. The groups said that the deal  poses ... grave dangers to consumers and creators in mature and emerging markets  and urged the government to consider stopping it.  If you conclude, as appears to us from the available information, that conditions and piecemeal divestitures will not be sufficient, then we hope you will challenge the merger in its entirety,  the groups said in their letter to Sessions. Aside from the Justice Department's antitrust review, the deal is at the center of a controversy over allegations that White House advisers considered using the probe as political leverage. Time Warner owns news station CNN, which President Donald Trump has criticized. AT&T; did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department declined comment on the letter.

An IPO will test investor's reception to Roku, the brainchild of digital video recorder (DVR) inventor Anthony Wood that was a pioneer in helping consumers cut the cord from traditional cable.          Roku made one of the first devices to offer streaming Internet content such as Netflix over TVs, but the market has since become more competitive, with Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc and others offering their own devices. Los Gatos, California-based Roku, which had prepared a confidential filing in 2014, is drafting a new registration document to account for the shift in its business model toward higher-margin advertising and licensing revenue, one of the sources said.  It has also hired a new adviser, Morgan Stanley, to lead the IPO, along with Citigroup Inc, the sources said, asking not to be named because the process is confidential. Morgan Stanley, Roku and Citi declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Roku had hired underwriters on Thursday.  The company said in February that it generated $400 million in revenue last year, with $100 million in its media and licensing segment. Roku's platform has been open to carrying more TV apps than its peers, including Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Google Play. Apple TV only recently announced plans to support Amazon Prime Video. The company has been fighting a legal ban in the Mexico, where cable operators are trying to stop the import and distribution of Roku devices on the grounds that they are sometimes hacked in order to watch pirated channels. Roku has been offering paid advertising options for its partners and gets a cut of advertising revenue from media companies with apps on its platform. It also licenses its software to companies like Sharp and Hitachi, allowing them to make televisions with built-in Roku streaming.  Roku has 15 million monthly active accounts as of June 30, 2017 that streamed in the last 30 days. It accounted for nearly half of all over-the-top streaming devices in the United States last year, according to market research firm comScore.

In May, the Trump administration proposed cutting discretionary U.S. Transportation Department spending by 12.7 percent, or $2.4 billion to $16.2 billion. A House of Representatives Appropriations Committee panel this week approved $17.8 billion in discretionary spending, $1.5 billion above the White House request. On Thursday, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao addressed a U.S. Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican who chairs the panel, said she was disappointed in many proposed cuts. The House panel rejected a White House plan to end subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service, which would have cut $630 million of $1.4 billion in annual government support for passenger rail service. The panel also rejected a plan to eliminate $150 million in annual subsidies for commercial air service to rural airports. Many lawmakers also opposed the administration's proposal to privatize the air traffic control system. In June, the Senate Commerce Committee approved proposed changes in Federal Aviation Administration policies. But unlike a House panel, it did not back spinning off air traffic control. The House will vote on the privatization plan as soon as next week. President Donald Trump says the move would modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. The proposal has drawn fire from private plane owners and rural airports. Critics say it would hand control of an important service to special interests and big airlines.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index closed down 8.99 points, or 0.06 percent, at 15,135. Shares of Manulife rose 1.9 percent to close at C$25.22 after The Wall Street Journal reported it is looking to list or spin off its U.S. unit John Hancock Financial Services. Overall, the financials group rose just 0.2 percent.  People are waiting to see the housing picture settle before they step in and buy the banks,  said Ian Scott, equity analyst at Manulife Asset Management. Investors worry that higher interest rates could weigh on Canada's economy just as the country's red-hot housing market shows some signs of slowing down. The yield on Canada's 10-year bond rose to its highest since December 2014 at 1.948 percent as investors braced for additional rate hikes from the central bank. The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that while Canada's economy has regained momentum, housing imbalances have increased and uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations with the United States could hinder the recovery. Some of the country's major bank stocks gained ground on Thursday, but Brookfield Asset Management Inc lost 0.9 percent to C$49.74. The reluctance of Renova Energia SA's largest shareholder to give up management of the debt-laden Brazilian renewable power firm threatens to derail takeover talks with Brookfield three people familiar with the matter said. Half of the index's ten main sector groups ended lower. The utilities group dipped 0.3 percent and telecoms lost nearly 0.5 percent. It is difficult for telecoms to rally when rates are rising because  they rely on debt financing,  Scott said. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.5 percent. Gold edged lower as gains on Wall Street offset wagers that policy tightening in the United States would be glacial at best. Losses for gold stocks were tempered by gains for fertilizer companies. Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc rose 1.9 percent to C$22.20. The energy group eked out a 0.2 percent gain, as oil prices rose after much stronger demand in China overshadowed a downbeat report by the International Energy Agency.

The church  complied with the interior minister's decision to cancel church trips and camps until further notice,  Father Rafik Greish, a spokesman for the Coptic Catholic Church, told Reuters late on Thursday. A Coptic church official, who spoke on condition of  anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, told Reuters that his church received  oral instructions this week, nothing written, to prevent panic,  he said. The source said the church was provided with more security forces to secure the gates of the church this week.

At least 23 soldiers were killed last week when suicide car bombs tore through two military checkpoints in the region in an attack claimed by Islamic State. It was one of the bloodiest assaults on security forces in years. But Islamic State has also intensified attacks in the mainland in recent months, often targeting Coptic Christians.

Right now, the investigation into the motive, including whether it was a hate crime, is still ongoing,  Erzen said in a telephone interview. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was helping police analyze Urbanski's digital devices.  We expect that to conclude in the coming weeks,  Erzen said.

With reigning Emmy champ  Game of Thrones  ineligible this year for the highest honors in television after it moved its seventh season to this summer, the door opened to five new shows vying for the top prize of best drama series. They include British royal series  The Crown  and supernatural mystery  Stranger Things,  both on Netflix; Hulu's breakout dystopian women's series  The Handmaid's Tale  starring best actress nominee Elisabeth Moss; and NBC's emotional family drama  This Is Us.  Television Academy chairman Hayma Washington noted the  explosive growth  in television in recent years, where more than 400 scripted shows vie for attention across streaming, cable and broadcast networks.  The creativity and excellence in presenting great storytelling and characters across a multitude of ever-expanding entertainment platforms is staggering,  Washington said in a statement. The nominations for  This Is Us,  including acting nods for stars Milo Ventimiglia, Sterling K. Brown and Chrissy Metz, make the show the first from a U.S. network to enter the Emmy drama series contest since CBS's  The Good Wife  in 2011. Among networks, HBO again had the highest overall tally, with 111 nods, mostly because of multiple nominations for crime drama  The Night Of  and female-driven murder mystery  Big Little Lies.  “When we started on this journey, we never thought the series would connect on such a big way worldwide,  said  Big Little Lies  star Nicole Kidman, who was among four of actresses on the limited series to get Emmy nominations. Streaming upstart Netflix followed with 91 and NBC at 64.  Saturday Night Live,  which has been on a ratings roll with its parodies of U.S. President Donald Trump and key figures in his administration, earned nods for stars Alec Baldwin, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Vanessa Bayer as well as a best variety sketch series nomination. Talk show hosts Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee and John Oliver, who also have mercilessly skewered Trump and his policies, won nominations in the variety show category. The comedy series race features more familiar faces, with two-time Emmy-winning political satire  Veep  nominated again. Millennial hip-hop show  Atlanta,  family racial comedy  black-ish,   Modern Family ,  Master of None   Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt  and tech comedy  Silicon Valley  round out the competition. First-time Emmy nominees included Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro for his role as disgraced financier Bernard Madoff in  The Wizard of Lies,  13-year-old newcomer Millie Bobby Brown for  Stranger Things  and Britain's Claire Foy for her portrayal of a young Queen Elizabeth II in  The Crown.  The Emmy awards will be presented at a ceremony hosted by Stephen Colbert in Los Angeles on Sept. 17.

An IPO will test investor's reception to Roku, the brainchild of digital video recorder (DVR) inventor Anthony Wood that was a pioneer in helping consumers cut the cord from traditional cable.          Roku made one of the first devices to offer streaming Internet content such as Netflix over TVs, but the market has since become more competitive, with Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc and others offering their own devices. Los Gatos, California-based Roku, which had prepared a confidential filing in 2014, is drafting a new registration document to account for the shift in its business model toward higher-margin advertising and licensing revenue, one of the sources said.  It has also hired a new adviser, Morgan Stanley, to lead the IPO, along with Citigroup Inc, the sources said, asking not to be named because the process is confidential. Morgan Stanley, Roku and Citi declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Roku had hired underwriters on Thursday.  The company said in February that it generated $400 million in revenue last year, with $100 million in its media and licensing segment. Roku's platform has been open to carrying more TV apps than its peers, including Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Google Play. Apple TV only recently announced plans to support Amazon Prime Video. The company has been fighting a legal ban in the Mexico, where cable operators are trying to stop the import and distribution of Roku devices on the grounds that they are sometimes hacked in order to watch pirated channels. Roku has been offering paid advertising options for its partners and gets a cut of advertising revenue from media companies with apps on its platform. It also licenses its software to companies like Sharp and Hitachi, allowing them to make televisions with built-in Roku streaming.  Roku has 15 million monthly active accounts as of June 30, 2017 that streamed in the last 30 days. It accounted for nearly half of all over-the-top streaming devices in the United States last year, according to market research firm comScore.

In May, the Trump administration proposed cutting discretionary U.S. Transportation Department spending by 12.7 percent, or $2.4 billion to $16.2 billion.         A House of Representatives Appropriations Committee panel this week approved $17.8 billion in discretionary spending, $1.5 billion above the White House request.         On Thursday, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao addressed a U.S. Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican who chairs the panel, said she was disappointed in many proposed cuts. The House panel rejected a White House plan to end subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service, which would have cut $630 million of $1.4 billion in annual government support for passenger rail service. The panel also rejected a plan to eliminate $150 million in annual subsidies for commercial air service to rural airports. Many lawmakers also opposed the administration's proposal to privatize the air traffic control system. In June, the Senate Commerce Committee approved proposed changes in Federal Aviation Administration policies. But unlike a House panel, it did not back spinning off air traffic control. The House will vote on the privatization plan as soon as next week. President Donald Trump says the move would modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. The proposal has drawn fire from private plane owners and rural airports. Critics say it would hand control of an important service to special interests and big airlines. Chao said the administration is working to address general aviation concerns. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), United Airlines (UAL.N) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) back the proposal. The Trump budget plan would cut $206 billion in infrastructure spending over 10 years, including $96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending. At the same time, the White House is proposing $200 billion in government funding over 10 years as part of a goal of getting $1 trillion in public and private infrastructure spending and plans to unveil details this fall. Chao acknowledged Thursday the highway trust funds must be made up and said the administration is studying other options including a mileage tax. Asked if Trump is considering a gasoline tax hike, Chao said:  Nothing is off the table.   A House panel also rejected this week the Trump administration plan to raise airline passenger security fees by $1 to $6.60 per one-way trip, which would generate $530 million for the Transportation Safety Administration.

But Gemma Lopez-Fernandez of Corporacio Sanitaria Parc Tauli in Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues write in the journal Women and Birth that more research is needed on the implications of nursing during pregnancy for mothers and children’s health.  While many women will decide to wean after getting pregnant, it is not uncommon for women to continue to nurse, Melissa Kotlen, an international board-certified lactation consultant based in New York, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “If you’re healthy, you’re low risk, you’re not on bedrest, there’s really no problem with continuing to nurse while you’re pregnant,” Kotlen said. “Most of these moms end up tandem nursing once the baby’s born anyway.”  But even pediatricians and obstetricians can fall prey to unproven but common beliefs about nursing during pregnancy, Kotlen added, for example that nipple stimulation will trigger the release of oxytocin and bring on labor prematurely, or that nursing during pregnancy will deplete a mother’s nutritional stores.  To investigate these and other potential risks of breastfeeding in pregnancy, Lopez-Fernandez and her team reviewed 19 studies published between 1990 and 2015 and including a total of about 6,300 women.  They found some evidence that women who nursed during pregnancy gained less weight, had fewer fat reserves and lower levels of hemoglobin – the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen. But the reviewers note that most research on the issue was done in the developing world. The investigators found no support for the idea that breastfeeding women were more likely to deliver prematurely or to miscarry. Evidence on the effects of nursing during pregnancy on fetal and infant growth, as well as on the growth of the nursing child, was mixed.  Mothers who become pregnant while nursing should not be overly concerned about their nutritional status, as long as they are eating and drinking well, Kotlen said. “Your body knows exactly what it needs to take in. If you’re pregnant and you’re nursing, your body is going to know very quickly you need to eat a little bit more and you need to drink a little more.” Lopez-Fernandez was not available for an interview by press time.

The new version of the bill did little to assuage concerns of moderate Republicans, who worried that its deep cuts to Medicaid would harm their most vulnerable residents. Two Republican senators said they would not even vote to open debate on the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two of his party's 52 Republicans, with Vice President Mike Pence ready to cast a tie-breaking vote. The Senate added a number of changes to the bill in an attempt to win more support. Here are the main provisions of the new version of the bill:  Skimpier Insurance Plans The bill contains an amendment from conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz that would allow insurers to sell stripped-down, low-cost insurance plans that do not comply with Obamacare's requirement that insurers cover a set of 10 essential health benefits. Those benefits include maternity and newborn care, mental health services and addiction treatment, outpatient care, hospitalization, emergency room visits and prescription drugs.  Insurers are strongly opposed to the amendment, which they say would raise insurance premiums for sick people, destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions. Senior Republican Senate aides said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) would assess a version of the legislation with the amendment, and one without it. Taxes The bill retains two key taxes on the wealthy created by Obamacare to help pay for other provisions in the legislation. It keeps a 3.8 percent net investment income surtax for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000, and a 0.9 percent surtax for the Medicare insurance program for the elderly on people with those incomes. It also keeps Obamacare's limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry. Those earning between zero and 350 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for tax credits under the proposal, but the credits are generally less generous than those provided under Obamacare. Under Obamacare, those earning between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for tax credits.  As with the earlier version, the bill repeals several Obamacare taxes, including on the pharmaceutical, medical device and health insurance industries. It also repeals a fine on individuals who do not purchase health insurance, as well as a penalty on employers who do not provide health insurance. Medicaid The bill leaves in place an overhaul of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. Moderate Republicans had been hoping the updated version would soften the cuts, which they said would devastate their most vulnerable residents.  The bill unwinds Obamacare's Medicaid expansion over three years, from 2021 to 2024. But it goes beyond repealing Obamacare by imposing drastic cuts to Medicaid that deepen in 2025. The CBO estimated the bill would cut Medicaid by nearly $800 billion by 2026, and would cut Medicaid 35 percent come 2036.  Additional Funds The bill contains an additional $45 billion for the opioid epidemic that has devastated parts of the United States, including West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. That is on top of the $2 billion included in the previous version of the bill.  The legislation also contains an additional $70 billion beyond the $112 billion in the earlier version for states to help insurers keep down rising insurance premiums and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses.

The loonie surged to its highest in more than a year on Wednesday, scoring its biggest one-day gain since March, after the central bank raised interest rates for the first time since 2010.     Chances of another interest rate hike by October have increased to nearly 65 percent from roughly one-in-two before the rate decision, data from the overnight index swaps market showed.                The U.S. dollar also rose against its peers, bouncing from losses in the previous session, as data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week and producer prices unexpectedly rose in June.     The data, which came a day after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen signaled a less hawkish stance than anticipated, was expected to keep the Fed on track for a third interest rate increase this year.            The market correctly, I think, reevaluated her (Yellen's) dovish stance from yesterday,  said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.  In light of that, you could say the fact that the Canadian dollar could hold on to its gains is a bit of an accomplishment.      At 4:00 p.m. ET (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2723 to the greenback, or 78.60 U.S. cents, up 0.2 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2722 to C$1.2771. It touched on Wednesday its strongest since June 2016 at 1.2681.     Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose as robust Chinese demand was seen helping to drain the global supply glut. U.S. crude        was up 1.23 percent to $46.05 a barrel.                  New housing prices in Canada climbed 0.7 percent in May, more than economists' forecasts for a 0.3 percent increase, as prices continued to rise in the hot markets of Toronto and Vancouver, Statistics Canada said.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 3.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.214 percent and the 10-year             falling 30 Canadian cents to yield 1.912 percent.     The 2-year yield touched its highest intraday level since September 2013 at 1.257, while the 10-year touched 1.948 percent, a level not reached since December 2014.

Haitians are struggling to survive a homeland devastated by natural disasters and disease, and the situation could worsen if U.S. officials return home more than 50,000 Haitians in the United States on temporary visas, they said. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has cast uncertainty over whether to extend a special immigration status that has been granted to Haitians since a 2010 earthquake. The Haitians in the United States send money, or remittances, home to families that rely on them heavily, said Steven Forester, a spokesman for the Boston-based Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti (IJDH).  Haiti is in no condition to both deal with the overwhelming challenges of the disasters that have struck ... much less to replace the remittances they send back to support hundreds of thousands of family members,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Haiti, the poorest country in the western hemisphere, was hit hard in October by Hurricane Matthew. The storm left some 1.4 million people in need of assistance and resurrected a deadly cholera outbreak, and the country has faced huge problems trying to rebuild. A growing number of Haitians are likely to be willing to undertake the dangerous journey by sea or land to flee, advocates say. The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted 102 Haitian migrants crowded on a rickety sailboat some 22 miles (35 kms) south of Great Inagua, Bahamas and sent them home on Wednesday. The Coast Guard in a statement said it was the largest such interdiction in more than a year.  The Caribbean and Florida Straits are dangerous and unforgiving for migrants on illegal and ill-advised voyages in overloaded vessels,  said Jason Ryan, chief of response for the Seventh Coast Guard District. U.S. immigration officials said in May that Haiti's special status designation would be extended for six months rather than the usual 18-month extension. While sending Haitians back could worsen conditions, residents of the island nation will keep striving to leave as long as they have few economic opportunities at home, said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute at New York University School of Law.

Standing beside his Mexican counterpart Pedro Joaquin Coldwell during a visit to Mexico City, Perry said it was a top priority to agree on a North American energy strategy, develop untapped resources and diversify energy supplies.  Mexico's prosperity is inextricably intertwined with our prosperity,  Perry said at a news conference. His comments underscored a different tone in bilateral relations from earlier this year, when U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican goods to protect U.S. industry, and to pull out of NAFTA altogether if he cannot rework it in the United States' favor. Trump hailed progress on trade after meeting his Mexican counterpart last Friday, on the sidelines of the Group of 20 leaders' summit in Hamburg, Germany, and Mexico said it expected a general agreement on reworking NAFTA by the end of 2017. With Mexico, the United States and Canada expected in mid-August to begin negotiations to update NAFTA, Perry said he was particularly supportive of those talks in the energy sector.

The United States called on China to release prisoners of conscience and free his widow, Liu Xia, who remains under house arrest.  Today, I join those in China and around the world in mourning the tragic passing of 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died while serving a lengthy prison sentence in China for promoting peaceful democratic reform,  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. His death was announced in a brief statement from the authorities in Shenyang, the northeastern city where he was being treated for late-stage liver cancer after being transferred from prison to hospital last month. France, Britain and Germany joined calls from Washington for Liu Xia to be allowed to travel and leave the country if she wished, and criticized Beijing for not having allowed Liu to travel abroad for treatment. The Norwegian government, which resumed full diplomatic relations with Beijing in December after they were put on ice due to the Nobel award to Liu Xiaobo, said in a one-paragraph statement it was saddened by Liu's death.  It is with deep grief that I received the news of Liu Xiaobo's passing,  Prime Minister Erna Solberg said.  Liu Xiaobo was for decades a central voice for human rights and China's further development.  An altar is set up for the late Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 13, 2017.Bobby YipBerit Reiss-Andersen, the leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee which awards the prize, said Liu would remain  a powerful symbol for all who fight for freedom, democracy and a better world . And she criticized Western governments for not being vocal enough in support of Liu before his death.   It is a sad and disturbing fact that the representatives of the free world, who themselves hold democracy and human rights in high regard, are less willing to stand up for those rights for the benefit of others,  she said. Slideshow (3 Images)U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said China and the world had  lost a principled champion who devoted his life to defending and promoting human rights, peacefully and consistently, and who was jailed for standing up for his beliefs . China's state news agency Xinhua reported Liu's death in a brief story in English, but not Chinese. References to his passing were swiftly removed from Weibo, the country's answer to Twitter, though images and comments were shared on the WeChat messaging service. Fellow dissident and artist Ai Weiwei was vocal in his criticism of Beijing. Liu Xiaobo was not a criminal,  he told Reuters in his Berlin studio.  He was a writer, an intellectual and he used his life to find ways to make society better.  Asked whether the Chinese government had contributed to Liu's death by preventing him from receiving treatment abroad, Ai said:  China showed how brutal its society can be.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said in June that it would seek to stop the deal because the combined company would control more than 90 percent of the U.S. market for paid daily fantasy sports contests.  We have determined that it is in the best interest of our shareholders, customers, employees and partners to terminate the merger agreement and move forward as an independent company,  FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles said in a statement.  DraftKings put out a similar statement.  We appreciate the continued loyalty of our players - it is you, our customers who have made this all possible - and we look forward to kicking off what is going to be our best NFL season yet!  DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement. The lawsuit by the trade commission was just the latest setback for the two companies, which have faced regulatory challenges in several states. They announced the deal in November as a merger of equals. Financial terms of the merger were not disclosed. Each of the companies had been valued at more than $1 billion before New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and other authorities began a crackdown on the industry in 2015. The tie-up was aimed at reducing costs as both companies separately fund legal defenses and lobby for legislation to authorize fantasy sports in states that have declared it illegal. Without a merger, the companies will have to go back to outspending each other to win customers. The companies have a history of aggressive advertising as they battled for market share. But they cut ad spending significantly in 2016 and said a combined company could again expand spending on advertising to attract new customers. In a filing responding to the FTC suit, both companies had defended the planned merger on Wednesday, saying it would not result in higher prices for customers and that regulators were pursuing  an unnecessarily rigid and uninformed application of the antitrust laws.

They haven't taken me out of the game,  Lula told supporters at the headquarters of his Workers Party a day after he received a nearly 10-year sentence for accepting bribes in return for helping an engineering company win contracts with state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro. The ruling was a stunning setback for Lula, one of the country's most popular politicians, and a serious blow to his chances of a political comeback. The former union leader, who won global praise for policies to reduce harsh inequality in Brazil, faces four more trials and will remain free on appeal. If his conviction is upheld on appeal, Lula will be barred from office, removing the front-runner from the 2018 race and opening the door to outsiders playing to widespread outrage over a deep economic recession and evidence of vast political graft. But Workers Party (PT) leaders and Lula's defense team are working on strategy to delay the decision by an appeals court, using every legal tool available, such as multiple appeals, to slow the process down, possibly allowing Lula to run for the presidency before any appeals court ruling.  Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attends a news conference after being convicted on corruption charges, in Sao Paulo, Brazil July 13, 2017.Nacho DoceHowever, the head of the appeals court in charge of Lula's case, Judge Carlos Thompson Flores, told Bandnews radio on Thursday that the court would have a ruling finalized before the October 2018 election.

Lula's legal team has already asked the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to examine the prosecution of Lula.

He denied any wrongdoing and excoriated the decision handed down by Judge Sergio Moro, who has overseen a sweeping three-year graft probe. Wearing a bright red shirt and a dark blazer, Lula made an appeal to fellow partisans that was folksy and upbeat, soliciting laughter and cheers from party elders and a crowd of hundreds outside the Workers Party offices in downtown Sao Paulo.

But NRG Energy Inc vowed to fight Dominion's proposal, calling it  a cynical scheme that should not be rewarded.  The state has solicited power from renewable sources of generation to support environmental programs. Dominion has said including nuclear power in this program will help cut the state's electricity costs, which are among the highest in the country.  We remain committed to work with Connecticut policymakers to address the issue of high electric rates in Connecticut and the future of Millstone in the current budget session,  said Millstone spokesman Kenneth Holt. But David Gaier, spokesman for NRG, said  handouts to nuclear operators, whether direct subsidies or out-of-market contracts, will cost ratepayers billions more.  Connecticut legislators, who did not pass a budget by the end of June, are still trying to iron out tax and spending issues in a special session. Millstone is among several nuclear plants in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest that could close before their licenses expire, as low wholesale power prices have squeezed profits. In June, Dominion asked ISO New England, which operates the New England power grid, what options the company had if it decides to retire the plant. But Holt said the company has not yet made a decision. The ISO said Dominion had already committed to generate power through May 2021, but noted it could retire the reactors so long as the company provides energy from another source. Holt noted the company could also agree to pay a penalty.  Hanging the threat of closing a profitable plant on the pretext of financial distress is a cynical scheme that should not be rewarded,  said Gaier. NRG has opposed proposals in half a dozen states to boost nuclear revenues. Connecticut is one of several states exploring ways to keep reactors in service to preserve carbon-free energy, jobs, taxes and a more diverse power pool. In 2016, New York and Illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors that were in danger of closing due to generators run on cheap natural gas. Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also considered proposals to protect their reactors. NRG, Dynegy Inc, Calpine Corp and other companies with natural gas-fired plants have challenged the New York and Illinois rules in federal court.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/dominion-inc-millstone-idUSL1N1K41TW"},

This is not a watershed moment like the Affordable Care Act, where it altered the healthcare industry,  he said.

Target Corp (TGT.N) rose 4.8 percent after an upbeat second-quarter forecast. The news boosted other retailers, with Wal-Mart (WMT.N) up 1.5 percent and Costco (COST.O) edging up 1.2 percent.

The lawmakers in the lower house voted against a decision in May by the Dominican Senate, which turned down recommendations made by President Danilo Medina to amend the criminal code and ease the nation's abortion ban. The Dominican Republic is one of seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that have absolute bans on abortion. The decision by the Dominican Congress on Tuesday would allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, when a mother's life is in danger or when a foetus would not survive the pregnancy. The contrasting decisions in each house pave the way for another vote to be introduced. Hopes have been raised among abortion rights activists that the country's ban on abortion - dating back to 1884 - can be finally repealed.  The vote has shown a clear majority of house representatives standing with Dominican women's fundamental rights to decide over their bodies and to be treated with dignity. This must be celebrated,  Robin Guittard, Caribbean campaigner at rights group Amnesty International, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The earlier vote by the Senate  would have virtually maintained a full ban on accessing abortion services ... in a context of high rates of unsafe abortions, maternal mortality and adolescent pregnancies,  he said. It is not clear when a new vote on the ban will occur, and it could be months before lawmakers start debating the controversial issue again, campaigners say. As in the past, moves to repeal the ban will face staunch opposition from conservative groups and the influential Catholic Church. Janet Camilo, the country's minister for women, has said the abortion ban is a health care issue for women and decisions not to repeal it were based on sexism. Blanket abortion bans put women's lives at risk by forcing women to undergo dangerous backstreet abortions, which were the cause of at least one in 10 maternal deaths in Latin America in 2014, according to Amnesty International. In recent years, the United Nations has urged the Dominican Republic to lift its abortion ban. Activists say the country should seize the opportunity to allow women to access a safe abortion in a country where more than 90,000 unsafe abortions occur each year.  Now it's imperative that Dominican lawmakers ensure that the new penal code proposed guarantees human rights and access to justice for all girls and women,  said Catalina Martinez, Latin America director at the U.S.-based Center of Reproductive Rights.

They haven't taken me out of the game,  Lula told supporters at the headquarters of his Workers Party a day after he received a nearly 10-year sentence for accepting bribes in return for helping an engineering company win contracts with state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro. The ruling was a stunning setback for Lula, one of the country's most popular politicians, and a serious blow to his chances of a political comeback. The former union leader, who won global praise for policies to reduce harsh inequality in Brazil, faces four more trials and will remain free on appeal. If his conviction is upheld on appeal, Lula will be barred from office, removing the front-runner from the 2018 race and opening the door to outsiders playing to widespread outrage over a deep economic recession and evidence of vast political graft. But Workers Party (PT) leaders and Lula's defense team are working on strategy to delay the decision by an appeals court, using every legal tool available, such as multiple appeals, to slow the process down, possibly allowing Lula to run for the presidency before any appeals court ruling.  Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attends a news conference after being convicted on corruption charges, in Sao Paulo, Brazil July 13, 2017.Nacho DoceHowever, the head of the appeals court in charge of Lula's case, Judge Carlos Thompson Flores, told Bandnews radio on Thursday that the court would have a ruling finalized before the October 2018 election.  Senator Gleisi Hoffmann, leader of the PT, said that the party would protest Lula's sentence internationally, though she did not define where. Lula's legal team has already asked the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to examine the prosecution of Lula. Slideshow (2 Images)Lula remains Brazil's best-known politician and has retained a base of loyal supporters despite his legal woes. As president, he put resources from a commodities boom into social programs helping to lift millions from poverty. Lula characterized the verdict against him as part of Brazilian elites' backlash against his legacy. He denied any wrongdoing and excoriated the decision handed down by Judge Sergio Moro, who has overseen a sweeping three-year graft probe. Wearing a bright red shirt and a dark blazer, Lula made an appeal to fellow partisans that was folksy and upbeat, soliciting laughter and cheers from party elders and a crowd of hundreds outside the Workers Party offices in downtown Sao Paulo. The former president said he continued to support strong democratic institutions, including police and prosecutors, but he lamented what he called politically-driven lies in the case against him.

But NRG Energy Inc vowed to fight Dominion's proposal, calling it  a cynical scheme that should not be rewarded.  The state has solicited power from renewable sources of generation to support environmental programs. Dominion has said including nuclear power in this program will help cut the state's electricity costs, which are among the highest in the country.  We remain committed to work with Connecticut policymakers to address the issue of high electric rates in Connecticut and the future of Millstone in the current budget session,  said Millstone spokesman Kenneth Holt. But David Gaier, spokesman for NRG, said  handouts to nuclear operators, whether direct subsidies or out-of-market contracts, will cost ratepayers billions more.  Connecticut legislators, who did not pass a budget by the end of June, are still trying to iron out tax and spending issues in a special session. Millstone is among several nuclear plants in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest that could close before their licenses expire, as low wholesale power prices have squeezed profits. In June, Dominion asked ISO New England, which operates the New England power grid, what options the company had if it decides to retire the plant. But Holt said the company has not yet made a decision.  The ISO said Dominion had already committed to generate power through May 2021, but noted it could retire the reactors so long as the company provides energy from another source. Holt noted the company could also agree to pay a penalty.  Hanging the threat of closing a profitable plant on the pretext of financial distress is a cynical scheme that should not be rewarded,  said Gaier. NRG has opposed proposals in half a dozen states to boost nuclear revenues. Connecticut is one of several states exploring ways to keep  reactors in service to preserve carbon-free energy, jobs, taxes and a more diverse power pool. In 2016, New York and Illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors that were in danger of closing due to generators run on cheap natural gas. Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also considered proposals to protect their reactors. NRG, Dynegy Inc, Calpine Corp and other companies with natural gas-fired plants have challenged the New York and Illinois rules in federal court.

Stocks were buoyed in Asia and elsewhere a day after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled a rise in interest rates would be less aggressive than some investors had expected.  Sentiment was also boosted after China reported upbeat data on exports and imports for June, the latest sign that global growth is picking up a bit.  That offset reports of higher production by key members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), lifting oil prices.     The Chinese trade data pushed Asian shares up more than 1 percent and lifted MSCI's 47-country gauge of global equity markets to a fresh record high with a gain of 0.34 percent.   Yesterday's move was in response to Yellen comments that should inflation remain below the 2 percent target rate, the central bank will be less aggressive in their tightening program,  said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.  Today, the market is saying that's old news and let's focus on the matter at hand, which is earnings that will be coming out in earnest this week,  Stovall said. U.S. shares rose in anticipation second-quarter earnings will grow 7.8 percent for S&P; 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, will report results on Friday. JPMorgan rose 0.64 percent, Wells Fargo gained 0.78 percent and  Citigroup added 0.15 percent, helping the financial sector to boost the benchmark S&P; 500 the most. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 20.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,553.09. The S&P; 500 gained 4.58 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,447.83 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 13.27 points, or 0.21 percent, to 6,274.44. In Europe, the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares rose 0.29 percent to close at 1,518.91. Oil Gains Encouraging U.S. economic data initially supported the dollar. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week for the first time in a month and producer prices unexpectedly rose in June. The data likely will keep the Fed on track for a third interest rate increase this year. The dollar index fell 0.02 percent, while the euro slid 0.06 percent to $1.1403. The Japanese yen weakened 0.09 percent versus the greenback at 113.24 per dollar.

But NRG Energy Inc vowed to fight Dominion's proposal, calling it  a cynical scheme that should not be rewarded.  The state has solicited power from renewable sources of generation to support environmental programs. Dominion has said including nuclear power in this program will help cut the state's electricity costs, which are among the highest in the country.  We remain committed to work with Connecticut policymakers to address the issue of high electric rates in Connecticut and the future of Millstone in the current budget session,  said Millstone spokesman Kenneth Holt. But David Gaier, spokesman for NRG, said  handouts to nuclear operators, whether direct subsidies or out-of-market contracts, will cost ratepayers billions more.  Connecticut legislators, who did not pass a budget by the end of June, are still trying to iron out tax and spending issues in a special session. Millstone is among several nuclear plants in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest that could close before their licenses expire, as low wholesale power prices have squeezed profits. In June, Dominion asked ISO New England, which operates the New England power grid, what options the company had if it decides to retire the plant. But Holt said the company has not yet made a decision.  The ISO said Dominion had already committed to generate power through May 2021, but noted it could retire the reactors so long as the company provides energy from another source. Holt noted the company could also agree to pay a penalty.  Hanging the threat of closing a profitable plant on the pretext of financial distress is a cynical scheme that should not be rewarded,  said Gaier. NRG has opposed proposals in half a dozen states to boost nuclear revenues. Connecticut is one of several states exploring ways to keep  reactors in service to preserve carbon-free energy, jobs, taxes and a more diverse power pool. In 2016, New York and Illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors that were in danger of closing due to generators run on cheap natural gas. Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also considered proposals to protect their reactors. NRG, Dynegy Inc, Calpine Corp and other companies with natural gas-fired plants have challenged the New York and Illinois rules in federal court.

Stocks were buoyed in Asia and elsewhere a day after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled a rise in interest rates would be less aggressive than some investors had expected.  Sentiment was also boosted after China reported upbeat data on exports and imports for June, the latest sign that global growth is picking up a bit.  That offset reports of higher production by key members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), lifting oil prices.     The Chinese trade data pushed Asian shares up more than 1 percent and lifted MSCI's 47-country gauge of global equity markets to a fresh record high with a gain of 0.34 percent.   Yesterday's move was in response to Yellen comments that should inflation remain below the 2 percent target rate, the central bank will be less aggressive in their tightening program,  said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.  Today, the market is saying that's old news and let's focus on the matter at hand, which is earnings that will be coming out in earnest this week,  Stovall said. U.S. shares rose in anticipation second-quarter earnings will grow 7.8 percent for S&P; 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, will report results on Friday. JPMorgan rose 0.64 percent, Wells Fargo gained 0.78 percent and  Citigroup added 0.15 percent, helping the financial sector to boost the benchmark S&P; 500 the most. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 20.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,553.09. The S&P; 500 gained 4.58 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,447.83 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 13.27 points, or 0.21 percent, to 6,274.44. In Europe, the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares rose 0.29 percent to close at 1,518.91. Oil Gains Encouraging U.S. economic data initially supported the dollar. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week for the first time in a month and producer prices unexpectedly rose in June. The data likely will keep the Fed on track for a third interest rate increase this year. The dollar index fell 0.02 percent, while the euro slid 0.06 percent to $1.1403. The Japanese yen weakened 0.09 percent versus the greenback at 113.24 per dollar.

The stock drop reversed positive gains earlier in the week driven by investor optimism about improving passenger unit revenue in the sector. The closely-watched metric measures sales relative to flight capacity.        Breaking a losing streak that has plagued much of the industry for the last two years, Delta posted a 2.5 percent increase in passenger unit revenue, but that performance was overshadowed by the carrier's poorer-than-expected bottom line. While positive unit growth is a bright spot for investors, stocks were slightly down sector-wide on Delta's results. The cost of fuel and mounting labor expenses, prompted in large part by renegotiated contracts with carriers' pilots, flight attendants and mechanics unions, added a sobering drag on an otherwise uplifting industry outlook on passenger unit revenue.  Related CoverageBoeing trade complaint won't slow CSeries deliveries: Delta CEOIn the second quarter of 2017, net income fell to $1.22 billion, or $1.68 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $1.55 billion, or $2.03 per share, a year earlier.      On an adjusted basis, the No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic earned $1.64 per share, compared to the analyst consensus forecast of $1.67, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company were down 2 percent at $54.35. Delta's unit revenue is expected to continue trending positive into the third quarter, with the carrier forecasting growth between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent. That progress is expected to boost the company's operating margins between 18 percent and 20 percent from the prior year. Delta said operating expenses climbed during the second quarter on higher salaries and fuel costs, its two biggest cost components. The airline paid an additional $338 million toward 2017 profit sharing with employees.  The June quarter represented the peak for non-fuel cost pressures this year and we expect our CASM (cost per available seat mile) trajectory to moderate to approximately 2 percent for the September quarter,  Delta Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said in a statement. Aircraft fuel related expenses rose 18 percent to $1.45 billion during the quarter, while salary costs were up 9 percent to $2.62 billion. Delta's operating margin in the June quarter, excluding special items, rose slightly to 18.4 percent, compared to 17.4 percent last year.  Total operating revenue rose 3.3 percent to $10.79 billion.

At least two U.S. experts are not convinced, however. The study was conducted by Dr. Kari Syrjanen who, along with five coauthors, works in Helsinki for Biohit Oyj, the company that funded the study and markets the lozenge as Acetium.  L-cysteine is an amino acid that eliminates acetaldehyde, a compound in cigarettes believed to play a role in tobacco addiction by enhancing the brain’s responses to nicotine. The research team recruited close to 2,000 cigarette smokers online and randomly assigned about half to use the L-cysteine lozenge with every single cigarette they smoked for six months, and the other half to use a dummy lozenge.  All participants kept an electronic diary, recording the number of cigarettes smoked and how much they enjoyed smoking each one. Altogether, 753 people followed the directions for the entire study, and another 944 followed the directions most of the time, according to the report in Anticancer Research.   Over six months, 331 people who finished the whole study quit smoking: 181 (18.2 percent) who took the L-cysteine lozenge and 150 (15 percent) who took the placebo. Among those who adhered strictly to the directions, 170 (45.3 percent) who took the L-cysteine lozenge quit smoking compared with 134 (35.4 percent) who took the placebo.  Less smoking pleasure and “smoking sensations changed” were given as strong reasons for quitting. Six percent of participants in the study reported adverse events (although the researchers didn’t collect the details), and the rate was about the same in both groups. Dr. Scott Sherman, codirector of the Section on Tobacco, Alcohol, and Drug Use at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York called the study “promising” but said the lozenge “is not ready for prime time.”  The results are “modest,” he told Reuters Health by email. The researchers didn’t compare the lozenge to other smoking-cessation treatments, he noted, and it’s not clear if it would have worked as well if participants weren’t required to complete the daily diary.  The lozenge isn’t available in the U.S., and other formulations of L-cysteine might not work as well as the one that was tested, Sherman noted. “If the manufacturer wanted to sell the product in the U.S. and claim that it helps with quitting smoking, it would need to be approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration,” he said. Martha Tingen, director of the Tobacco Control Initiative at Augusta University in Georgia, also noted study limitations, including the fact that one-third of the people who originally enrolled didn't actually participate.  Also, she pointed out in an email to Reuters Health, “The study was based solely on self report. There was no face-to-face and no one checked participants’ blood, saliva or expelled air to see if they actually decreased or quit smoking.”  Most successful smoking-cessation interventions also include behavior counseling, she added. “If you have somebody you’re accountable to, it makes you feel better.” Sherman said if one of his relatives wanted to quit smoking, “I would tell them to use one of the seven medications demonstrated in (the U.S.) to be effective - nicotine replacement (patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler and nasal spray), bupropion and varenicline - in conjunction with a call to Quitline (1-800-QUIT-NOW), as that remains the best way to quit smoking.” His preference? “The combination of a nicotine patch plus either nicotine gum or lozenge, particularly since they are available over the counter.” The authors and Biohit representatives did not reply to requests for comment.

But Vanguard has also suffered a string of technical glitches since last year and responded by adding staff. Software engineers make up about a quarter of its workforce of about 15,000 people.  The goal is that we not only lead on investment returns, we lead on our level of service to clients,  Buckley, 48, said in an interview. Another concern has been that index funds could lose their appeal in a market downturn, an environment that in theory could favor some active fund managers. While Vanguard also offers active funds, Buckley said the concern was misplaced.  There's no good environment for high costs,  he said.  Markets will humble you, and volatility will return. You've got to stay disciplined,  he said. McNabb said the timing seemed right to step back from the top job, and that there were no other internal or external candidates to succeed him after working closely with Buckley on Vanguard's executive committee more than 16 years. Buckley will become the fourth CEO of privately held Vanguard, which began operations in 1975 under founder John C. Bogle, an icon of low-cost investing who remains affiliated with the company but is no longer in a senior leadership role. Buckley was also named on Thursday as president of Vanguard and appointed a director. Greg Davis, head of fixed income, will take over as chief investment officer. Vanguard also named two other new directors, Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former U.S. Treasury official, and Deanna Mulligan, CEO of The Guardian Life Insurance Co.

In his first defense policy speech, Macron said he would not tolerate public dissent from the military after General Pierre de Villiers reportedly told a parliament committee he would not let the government  fuck with  him on spending cuts.  For me it's undignified to wash dirty linen in public,  Macron said in the traditional annual address to the army that he squeezed into his busy schedule during a two-day visit to Paris by U.S. President Donald Trump.  I have made commitments, I am your boss,  Macron added to an audience of dozens of top army officers and their families. Macron's government trimmed the 2017 defense budget in an effort to ensure France meets its commitment to bring its budget deficit below the European Union cap of 3 percent of national income in 2017. De Villiers, whose mandate as the military chief of staff was extended by a year on Wednesday by the new defense minister, criticized at a parliamentary committee hearing on the same day the 850-million-euro ($969 million) cut in this year's budget.  I wont let myself be fucked like that,  he said in the closed-door hearing, according to two parliamentary sources, confirming information by Challenges magazine.  I may be stupid, but I know when I'm being had,  he added, according to the sources, who declined to be named. In his speech, Macron made clear he would not let this kind of criticism happen again.  What I like is the sense of duty, the sense of discretion that has taken our army to where it is today. And what I sometimes find hard to tolerate in certain sectors, I tolerate it even less when it comes to our military,  he said. Macron nonetheless appeared to have heeded calls for higher military spending by his defense officials and opposition leaders, saying that 2018 would mark the start of a new phase of increased expenditure.  France's defense spending will reach 34.2 billion euros in 2018, including 650 million for external operations, up from 32.7 billion euros in 2017, Macron said.  It's a considerable effort, considering the current context of budgetary constraints,  added Macron, who will preside over the traditional Bastille Day military parade on Friday alongside Trump as his guest of honor, The 39-year old leader has pledged to bring France's defense budget to the equivalent of two percent of economic output by 2025 from 1.7 percent today. His government is at the same time struggling to bring the budget deficit below the EU's 3 percent limit this year, which would be the first time in a decade, after the public auditor said the deficit was on course to touch 3.2 percent of GDP.

They said futures' discounts to preliminary cash prices limited market losses.     CME livestock market funds that track the Standard & Poor's Goldman Sachs Commodity Index           at times sold, or  rolled , August futures and simultaneously bought October on the fourth of five days of the Goldman Roll process.

Futures' bullish discounts to cash prices versus bearish wholesale beef values made it difficult to trade the market on Thursday, said Oak Investment Group President Joe Ocrant.     So far this week packers in the U.S. Plains paid $120 per cwt for slaughter-ready, or cash, cattle that a week ago brought $117 to $119, said feedlot sources.     They said feedlots are asking more than $120 per cwt for unsold cattle, given slipping but still profitable packer profits.      However, processors are aware that people typically grill less in extremely hot weather, which has dragged down wholesale beef values in recent weeks.                      CME feeder cattle finished higher, led by sharply lower corn prices and follow-through buying after futures' 4.500-cent limit-up settlement on Wednesday.     August feeders         ended 1.275 cents per pound higher at 153.025 cents.

The roll by funds weighed on August futures and propped up the October contract.     July        , which will expire on Monday, ended up 0.175 cent per pound to 92.750 cents. Most actively-traded August         finished down 0.100 cent to 82.525 cents, and October         ended up 0.050 cent to 69.325 cents.     Tight hog supplies underpinned cash prices, while retailers consider featuring beef that is now more competitively-priced to pork, said traders and analysts.

Thursday's decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan also rejected the Nationals' bid to reinstate a nearly $300 million award it had won from the panel, the Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee (RSDC), covering fees from the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network from 2012 to 2016. But the Nationals called the decision a  major  victory in its battle for more than $100 million of disputed fees from MASN, which carries both teams' games but is controlled by the Orioles, for each of the 2012-2016 and 2017-2021 periods. Carter Phillips, a lawyer for the Orioles, said the team may appeal to New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals. New York Supreme Court Justice Lawrence Marks threw out the original award in November 2015, saying it was unfair because the Nationals' law firm Proskauer Rose had worked for Major League Baseball and executives from teams on the panel: the New York Mets, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Tampa Bay Rays. The judge last July then rejected the Nationals' bid to arbitrate again before the RSDC, whose membership has changed. But in Thursday's 3-2 decision, the Appellate Division said the Orioles, Nationals and MASN were contractually bound to resolve TV rights disputes before the panel.  The dissent's position that the new panel will remain puppets of MLB, rather than exercise its independent judgment, is pure conjecture,  though the original award was properly voided because of  evident partiality,  wrote Justice Richard Andrias, a member of the majority. Justice Rolando Acosta wrote in dissent that the dispute belonged before the American Arbitration Association, citing the commissioner's office's prior support for the Nationals' position.  MLB still controls nearly every facet of the RSDC and has shown itself - through its past conduct and the Commissioner's statements - to be incapable of protecting fundamental fairness  in the dispute, Acosta wrote. A 3-2 vote raises the likelihood the Court of Appeals will take up the case. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing the Nationals, said:  We look forward to finally having the rights fees determined in the forum the parties chose.  Major League Baseball and its law firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/baseball-television-orioles-nationals-idUSL1N1K41R6"},

Big U.S. banks start reporting quarterly results on Friday and according to data from State Street, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF.P), which tracks the S&P; 500 Financials sector .SPSY, has pulled in a net $662 million of inflows, bringing the year-to-date inflows to nearly $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, the Financial Select ETF is up 7.6 percent to $25.01.  There is good reason for investors to be optimistic about the financial sector,  said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  We just had two rounds of stress tests that every single bank passed with flying colors. In general, the banking industry is in very good shape right now,  he said. Shares in the biggest U.S. banks rose at the end of June after they unveiled buyback and dividend plans that topped analyst expectations after the U.S. Federal Reserve approved capital proposals in its annual stress test program. Some of the fund's top holdings, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), report results on Friday and others, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) will post results next week. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for S&P; 500 financial companies rose 7 percent, the third-best growth for a sector after energy and technology, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The financial earnings are going to probably be better-than-expected because we have seen a tick up in the yield curve, and that is going to be better for net interest income,  said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in Charleston, South Carolina. Longer-dated Treasury yields have jumped so far this month while shorter-dated yields have either inched higher or fallen, resulting in a so-called  steepening  of the yield curve. A steeper yield curve benefits bank profitability since it allows banks to borrow at lower short-term rates and lend at higher long-term rates.  Financials have managed to make money no matter what gets thrown at them. Regulations, zero interest rates, they still come through. So I think that we're going to see a positive surprise,  Cavanaugh said. Traders in the options market appear to expect the fund's shares to rise in the near term. For XLF options contracts expiring on July 21, which will cover results from the largest banks, there are 1.2 calls open for each open put. For contracts expiring after this date, the measure stands at 0.77 calls per open put, a significantly more defensive stance. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and usually are used to place bets on shares rising, while put options give the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future. Options on the SPDR S&P; Bank ETF (KBE.P) and individual bank stocks including Bank of America Corp also show a similar bullish bias in near-term contracts. On Thursday, trading in XLF's options leaned toward bullish bets, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.

Slideshow (3 Images)Colonia Dignidad was founded in 1961 by former World War II German army medic Paul Schaefer. The community, which embraced ultra-traditional values, operated as an isolated cult under Schaefer, who sexually abused and tortured dozens of youths. During the 1973 to 1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, the community also served as a detention and torture site for enemies of the regime.  As Latin America has transitioned to democracy in recent decades, truth commissions and public displays documenting past abuses have become common in many countries, including Chile. In 2006, former members of the cult issued a public apology and asked for forgiveness for 40 years of human rights abuses in their community, saying they were brainwashed by Schaefer, who many viewed as a God.  Colonia Dignidad continues to stir controversy in Chile, as residents have rebranded the community as a rustic, Bavaria-themed retreat for Santiago residents, which victims argue is disrespectful.

Yields on U.S. 30-year bonds hit session highs after a weak auction of 30-year bonds. Traders earlier sold the bond to boost the yield, which moves inversely to the price, so they can buy it at a lower price at the auction in a practice known as  concession.  But the  concession  wasn't enough to entice buyers. Traders had expected a poor 30-year auction given the fact that the bond has not been sold off enough and speculative investors amassed long positions leaving little room for an upside. On Thursday, the Treasury's $12 billion, 30-year bond reopening fetched a yield of 2.936 percent, higher than market expectations of 2.926 percent at the bid deadline. Bids totaled $27.7 billion for a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.31, little changed from last month's 2.32. Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks, accepted 61.7 percent, lower than last month's 63.7 percent and the 62.7 percent average. Treasury yields were also lifted after Germany's 10-year bond yield rose above 0.50 percent following a report that the European Central Bank was likely to signal in September that it will gradually unwind its asset purchase program next year.  It has been a continued grind lower in prices, part of it is Europe,  said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. Also on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified for a second day on the U.S. economy, appearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Yellen covered much of the same ground as her session with a House committee on Wednesday where she said the Fed's plans for further gradual rate increases and a slow drawdown of its balance sheet remain on track. U.S. Treasury yields fell on Wednesday after Yellen's testimony before the House committee. Treasuries also took their cue from Thursday's U.S. data, which were steady overall, with jobless claims dropping to 247,000 for the week ended July 8. U.S. producer prices, on the other hand, gained 0.1 percent in June, with core prices also Yields rose slightly on the economic data. In late trading, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.346 percent, up from 2.327 percent late Wednesday. U.S. 30-year bond yields rose to 2.918 percent, from 2.894 percent on Wednesday. At the front-end of the curve, the two-year yield was at 1.367 percent, up from Wednesday's 1.351 percent.

Thursday's decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan also rejected the Nationals' bid to reinstate a nearly $300 million award it had won from the panel, the Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee (RSDC), covering fees from the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network from 2012 to 2016.  But the Nationals called the decision a  major  victory in its battle for more than $100 million of disputed fees from MASN, which carries both teams' games but is controlled by the Orioles, for each of the 2012-2016 and 2017-2021 periods. Carter Phillips, a lawyer for the Orioles, said the team may appeal to New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals. New York Supreme Court Justice Lawrence Marks threw out the original award in November 2015, saying it was unfair because the Nationals' law firm Proskauer Rose had worked for Major League Baseball and executives from teams on the panel: the New York Mets, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Tampa Bay Rays. The judge last July then rejected the Nationals' bid to arbitrate again before the RSDC, whose membership has changed. But in Thursday's 3-2 decision, the Appellate Division said the Orioles, Nationals and MASN were contractually bound to resolve TV rights disputes before the panel.  The dissent's position that the new panel will remain puppets of MLB, rather than exercise its independent judgment, is pure conjecture,  though the original award was properly voided because of  evident partiality,  wrote Justice Richard Andrias, a member of the majority. Justice Rolando Acosta wrote in dissent that the dispute belonged before the American Arbitration Association, citing the commissioner's office's prior support for the Nationals' position.  MLB still controls nearly every facet of the RSDC and has shown itself - through its past conduct and the Commissioner's statements - to be incapable of protecting fundamental fairness  in the dispute, Acosta wrote. A 3-2 vote raises the likelihood the Court of Appeals will take up the case. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing the Nationals, said:  We look forward to finally having the rights fees determined in the forum the parties chose.  Major League Baseball and its law firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Austria's Defence Ministry filed legal charges against Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium in February, alleging deception and fraud linked to the 2003 purchase. Airbus and the consortium, which includes Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Italy's Leonardo (LDOF.MI), have denied the accusations. Austria said last week it planned to end its $2 billion Eurofighter program early and replace it with a cheaper alternative. In a letter to Austrian Economics Minister Harald Mahrer dated July 11 and seen by Reuters, Airbus said efforts to criminalize business deals linked to the order threatened the reputation of aerospace suppliers. Airbus also defended Austria's Economics Ministry which had agreed to so-called  offset  deals associated with the order. Such deals, which are common practice in big international defense orders, seek to generate work for local firms.  The tendency to criminalize suppliers and their partners in such an internationally important order is not acceptable for us as an industry,  Airbus management representative for Austria, Peter Denker, said in the letter. He said  false allegations  undermined the reputation of the Economics Ministry and supplier industry. The Economics Ministry confirmed it had received the letter on Thursday but declined to comment. The letter keeps alive the row between Airbus and Austria over the fraud investigation, which has widened to include individuals including Airbus chief executive Tom Enders. In April, Enders described the handling of the allegations a  politically-motivated abuse of the legal system  and accused Austria's centrist coalition of using Airbus as an electoral  punching bag . Austria holds a parliamentary election in October. Some defense industry officials said the German CEO had overreacted and urged Airbus to take a less confrontational approach. Airbus could not immediately be reached to comment on the letter or a parliamentary inquiry, which was launched into how contracts were awarded. The inquiry ended on Wednesday and a final report is expected next week. In the letter, Airbus said:  For Airbus, our former parent company Daimler (DAIGn.DE), the other Eurofighter partners and the engine industry, the current politically motivated election campaign has long exceeded reasonable levels.  Greens lawmaker Peter Pilz, who initiated the parliamentary probe, said the inquiry had showed companies, including Airbus and Daimler (DAIGn.DE), should be prosecuted for possible fraud.

The parents of 11-month-old Charlie Gard have been fighting a legal battle to send their son to the United States for the experimental therapy, but Britain's courts have refused permission on the grounds it would prolong his suffering without any realistic prospect of it helping. Charlie suffers from a form of mitochondrial disease, a rare genetic condition causing progressive muscle weakness and brain damage, and London's world-renowned Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH) says he has no quality of life so his life support should be turned off. The case has garnered worldwide attention after interventions by U.S. President Donald Trump and Pope Francis, who both voiced support for Charlie on Twitter. GOSH asked London's High Court for a new hearing last week after his parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, said they had new evidence the U.S treatment would improve Charlie's condition. Appearing via video link from New York, the U.S. doctor offering the treatment, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said new data and analysis of his research work since the case was first heard in April had given a better perspective on the chances of the treatment's success. He told the court there was between 11 and 56 percent chance the nucleoside therapy would improve the baby's muscular strength and that there was a  small but significant  chance it would also improve brain functions. One of the key arguments in the case has been whether any of the brain damage Charlie has suffered is reversible and whether he is suffering. His parents stormed angrily out of the hearing shortly before the lunch break after the judge said they had agreed that Charlie's life without any medical improvement was not worth sustaining.  We have said he's not suffering, he's not in pain,  Yates said. The U.S. expert said the reports of brain scans suggested that Charlie had brain disorder rather than structural damage. He said the better muscular strength would allow a better assessment of his brain condition.  In my view my keeping Charlie on artificial ventilation will not cause significant harm because he does not seem to be in pain,  he said. The doctor, who has never seen Charlie and has had limited access to his medical records, said he was prepared to come to Britain for a meeting with other medical experts to try to give a definitive verdict on his condition. Judge Nicholas Francis, whose original ruling has also been upheld by the European Court of Human Rights, said the meeting needed to be held in the next couple of days.  If there is important new evidence that suggests my decision should be changed then I will change it,  he said. A hearing to confirm the details will take place on Friday. The case has provoked heated debate and the judge revealed that some staff from GOSH including doctors and lawyers had been subjected to  the most vile abuse and threats .  It has been and remains the unanimous view of all of those caring for Charlie at Great Ormond Street that withdrawal of ventilation and palliative care are all that the hospital can offer him consistent with his welfare,  the hospital said in a position statement to the court.

Froome lost 22 seconds to stage winner Romain Bardet of France at the end of a short, steep climb in Peyragudes, and 20 to Italian Fabio Aru, who snatched the overall leader's yellow  jersey from the defending champion.      It's a good sign (that the Tour is not over yet) but it was just two hundred metres and I would not think too much about it,  LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in his daily chat with Reuters on Thursday.         Although Froome could not follow Bardet, Aru and others in the final 200 metres, where the gradient rose to almost 20 percent, the Briton remains in contention and with a final time trial that will favor him in the penultimate stage.      Sky still have a very strong team relative to others,  said American LeMond, a Tour winner in 1986, 1989 and 1990.     But Bardet, (Colombia's Rigoberto) Uran and Aru are all very close.      The Italian leads Froome by six seconds and Bardet by 25, with Uran -- second behind Bardet and just ahead of Aru in Thursday's 12th stage -- in fourth place, 55 seconds off the pace.      Hopefully, seeing Froome crack will give them more confidence to attack,  said LeMond.  I think they were intimidated.  LeMond added that Bardet and Aru should pile the pressure on Froome and not hesitate to play mind games as the three-time champion is still the favorite.      If Bardet attacks, Aru should let Froome work to catch him, and if Aru attacks, Bardet should do the same,  he said.

They're dumping steel and destroying our steel industry, they've been doing it for decades, and I'm stopping it. It'll stop,  he told reporters on Air Force One during a flight from the United States to France.  There are two ways: quotas and tariffs.  Maybe I'll do both,  he said. Steel stocks rallied on the news, recovering some of the year-to-date declines in the sector. The S&P; 1500 steel sector index added as much as 3 percent shortly after Trump's remarks. The index rallied nearly 40 percent in the weeks following the Nov. 8 election, but so far this year it was down 6.6 percent at Wednesday On Thursday, the VanEck Vectors steel exchange-traded fund rose 0.6 percent after being down 1 percent before Trump's remarks. AK Steel shares gained 7.9 percent, Nucor gained 2.6 percent and US Steel added 4.0 percent.     Trump's action on steel is a part of a campaign pledge he made to help revive U.S. manufacturing. The administration's decision on steel could be unveiled in the coming weeks. Trump also said he would invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the White House.  I don’t think this is the right time, but the answer is yes, I would,  Trump said when asked if he would extend such an invitation to the Russian leader.

Ryan,Robert Mueller,Trump Jr.,US,USA,TRUMP,RUSSIA,FEC,Crime / Law / Justice,Elections / Voting,Lawmaking,Russia,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,Crime,Government / Politics,Europe,US Government News,Regulation,United States","sector":"Politics","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. agency that could bring civil charges against Donald Trump, Jr. if it found he violated campaign finance laws by meeting with a Russian who purportedly had damaging information on Hillary Clinton is often gridlocked by partisan politics and can take years to mete out punishment, legal experts said on Wednesday.  Some Democratic lawmakers want the Federal Election Commission to charge Trump Jr. based on emails in which he eagerly agreed to meet with a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer with damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Clinton.  They argue that his enthusiasm was akin to seeking something of  value  from a foreigner, which is prohibited under U.S. campaign laws.  Democrat U.S. Representative Grace Meng wrote to the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday asking it to take up a complaint against Trump Jr. that was filed this week by government watchdog group Common Cause.  The group asked the agency to investigate and said there was  a troubling pattern of President Trump, members of his family and key advisors acting as if they are above the law.       Judith Ingram, a spokeswoman for the Federal Election Committee, said any complaints it received would be handled confidentially and she declined further comment.    Larry Noble, a former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission who now is senior director of the Campaign Legal Center said he thinks complaints about Trump Jr. have merit and that the agency should investigate. Noble said if the commission rejected or ignored the complaints, outside groups could sue it to try to force an investigation.  The Department of Justice could file criminal charges if there was evidence of wrongdoing by Trump Jr., but such decisions would be left to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating  possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.     The Federal Election Commission consists of six commissioners, traditionally three Republicans and three Democrats, but vacancies have left just one Democrat, an independent and three Republicans.  To begin an investigation against Trump Jr., four of the commissioners would need to consent. If any of the Republicans declined to consent the group would be gridlocked. Former Federal Election Commission Chair Ann Ravel has been a vocal critic of the agency, writing in a report earlier this year that it was  deadlocked  by partisan division. She cited the agency's refusal to investigate secretly owned shell corporations contributing millions to political groups known as Super PACS, thereby making it impossible to determine the source of the cash. She noted that in 2006 commissioners were deadlocked in  2.9 percent of substantive votes in Matters Under Review that were closed that year. In 2016, the commissioners deadlocked in 30 percent of all substantive votes taken in such matters. In 2006, she wrote, the Commission assessed more than $5.5 million in civil monetary penalties for Matters Under Review. In 2016, it imposed a total of $595,425 in civil monetary penalties for Matters Under Review.  In an opinion piece for The New York Times in February, she wrote,  What we are left with is an agency mandated to ensure transparency and disclosure that is actually working to keep the public in the dark.  Paul S. Ryan, a lawyer with Common Cause who filed the complaint against Trump Jr., acknowledged that the agency's enforcement power is  very weak.      “Our best hope ... is going to be Robert Mueller’s investigation,” he said.

ON WHETHER HE WAS AWARE HIS SON DONALD TRUMP JR. WAS MEETING WITH A RUSSIAN LAWYER  No. That I didn’t know. Until a couple of days ago, when I heard about this. No I didn’t know about that.  ON WHETHER HE WISHED HE HAD KNOWN HIS SON WAS HAVING THE MEETING  Look - that campaign ... I actually always thought I’d win, to be honest with you, because I’ve been winning my whole life, to be honest with you, but we started a campaign as a non-politician, and many people were skeptical. Some weren’t, some people who know me weren’t ... but many were skeptical. And it was a wild time. And we would meet with many people.   That same meeting: a person comes in, sits, leaves, quickly. It was a 20-minute meeting, I guess, from what I’m hearing. Many people, and many political pros, said everybody would do that. If you got a call and said, 'Listen I have information on Hillary and the DNC,' or whatever it was they said, most people are going to take that meeting, I think.  On Whether He Wished His Son Had Not Taken the Meeting “I think many people would have held that meeting.  “And you have to understand, when that took place, this was before Russia fever. There was no Russia fever back then, that was at the beginning of the campaign, more or less. There was no Russia fever.  “Most of the phony politicians who are Democrats who I watched over the last couple of days – most of those phonies that act holier-than-thou, if the same thing happened to them, they would have taken that meeting in a heartbeat.  On Discussions With Putin About Election Meddling  First question - first 20, 25 minutes - I said, ‘Did you do it?’ He said, ‘No, I did not, absolutely not.’ I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, ‘Absolutely not.’  “Somebody did say if he did do it, you wouldn’t have found out about it. Which is a very interesting point.”  Look: Something happened and we have to find out what it is, because we can’t allow a thing like that to happen to our election process. So something happened, and we have to find out what it is.  “We have to find out and get to the bottom of what’s going on, because we can’t have even the slightest suspicion about our election process.” “Now, everybody agrees that there was no impact on the votes in this election, which is very important to say, but we have to make sure that nothing could ever happen to our election process.  On Whether He Trusted Putin  Do I feel I can trust anybody, OK? I’m a very suspicious person. I am not a person that goes around trusting lots of people. But he’s the leader of Russia. It is the second most powerful nuclear power on earth. I am the leader of the United States. I love my country. He loves his country. He’s for Russia. President Xi – I had a long meeting with him too, 2-1/2 hours, great relationship. He’s for China, I’m for the United States. They’re for their countries. But I do things the way I do things, and it’s just worked out.   But we had a very productive meeting. Including the fact that I think we have a good shot at piece by piece getting Syria to stop fighting. Ultimately Ukraine. And other things, including the destruction of terrorists as we know them.  On Discussions About Syria With Putin  So I’m sitting with Putin, and we had a very good - we were there two hours and 15 minutes - we had a very good meeting. One of the things brought up was a ceasefire. I said, 'We’ve got to solve this problem in Syria. And Ukraine by the way.' And what happened is we sat down and we worked out a ceasefire, which is by the way, as of 20 minutes ago, totally holding, and that’s four days. Four days doesn’t sound like a lot, but they’ve never had a ceasefire that lasted at all. That’s because Putin told them, as opposed to somebody that nobody ever heard of. Putin and I agreed to it, and we have a four-day ceasefire. That means many lives have already been saved because of four days. But it’s going to go on for a while, and things are going to go better.  On the Relationship With Putin  I was very tough with President Putin. We have a very important relationship. It’s going to be a relationship where lots of lives could be saved, like as an example with the ceasefire, which nobody else could have gotten but me.   I campaigned on strong military, strong borders, and low oil prices.   Look what I’ve done – oil prices have been driven down. We’re sending LNG to Poland, massive shipments to Poland. That’s not what Putin wants. And for the military, we’ve got $56 billion more of equipment than anybody ever thought of, in the last budget. Putin doesn’t want that – so why would Putin want me?” “It’s really the one question I wish I would have asked Putin: Were you actually supporting me?   I’m very big on energy, and that’s not good for Russia, because Russia makes its money with energy. That drives the price of energy down. I also am very strong on the military, very, very strong on the military. I’m also very strong on cyber.   I would bet that inwardly Putin would have been against me.” On the Mood in the White House  The mood in the White House is fantastic.   We have done more in five months than practically any president in history.   If you look at Iraq and if you look at Syria and you see the progress we’ve made with ISIS, it’s been almost complete.   The White House is functioning beautifully. The stock market has hit a new high. Job numbers are the best they’ve been in 16 years. We have a Supreme Court judge already confirmed. Energy is doing levels that we’ve never done before. Our military is doing well. We’re knocking the hell out of ISIS, which Obama wasn’t. There’s not a thing that we’re not doing well in. The White House is functioning beautifully, despite the hoax made up by the Democrats.  On Whether His Legal Team Is Defending Him Well “The problem is, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t do anything. This isn’t a question of defense. I didn’t do anything. I had no relationship to Russia. So I said, what can the legal team do?  On His Frustration With the Russia Story  The only frustration is that this Russia story is a hoax made up by the Democrats as an excuse for losing an election that they should have won because it’s almost impossible for a Republican to win the Electoral College.”  There was zero coordination. It’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. There’s no coordination, this was a hoax, this was made up by the Democrats.   This is the greatest con job in history, where a party sits down the day after they got their ass kicked, and they say, 'Huh, what’s our excuse?'”  It just continues and continues, and honestly it’s a disgrace, and it’s very bad for our country. And the Russians must be laughing, because this narrative is so bad for us as a country.

The Republican president said Democrats had used the accusations to justify Clinton's loss in November, saying:  The White House is functioning beautifully despite the hoax made up by the Democrats.  Although he and Putin were able to forge a ceasefire agreement in part of Syria, Trump said their interests collided over other issues. He said his U.S. military buildup and drive to increase U.S. energy production were in direct conflict with Putin, whose nation is dependent on energy exports.

She sent the bag to NASA for authentication, and when tests revealed it was used by Armstrong and still had moon dust traces inside, the U.S. space agency decided to keep it. Carlson successfully sued NASA to get the bag back, and the attention created by her legal challenge prompted many inquiries from potential buyers, according to Sotheby's. That led Carlson to decide to auction it again. Hatton said she was sure the bag would find a good home.

Total assets held by emerging markets-focused private equity funds increased from $254 billion at the end of 2010 to $564 billion as of September 2016, according to alternative assets research firm Preqin. The firm also found that the EM-dedicated private equity funds have seen their assets grow at an average annual rate of 21 percent over the past decade, growing from $93 billion in December 2006. This comes despite EM-focused private equity funds representing a declining percentage of global activity in recent years. In 2016 187 emerging market private equity funds were closed for new deposits with $45 billion of aggregate annual capital raised. That's down from 2011 when 482 private equity funds were closed for funding and raised $87 billion. Preqin's data showed investors still viewed North America, Europe and Asia more favorably than emerging markets as  presenting the best opportunities.   Robust performance and recent net capital flows to investors have proved that emerging markets-focused vehicles can offer real returns on investment,  said Christopher Elvin, head of private equity products at Preqin.  While fewer investors view emerging markets as presenting the best opportunities compared to Europe or North America, if EM-focused funds can maintain their strong performance we may see that gap narrow in coming quarters.” Investors in developed markets have historically allocated greater capital to assets from their home markets and other developed markets as emerging market assets are often viewed as riskier and less liquid. Just 14 percent of the global investor population is based in emerging market countries, according to Preqin's data. About 20 percent of global private equity investors said they intended to increase their allocation to the asset class over the next 12 months with 75 percent saying they planned to maintain their current allocation and 5 percent planning a reduction. About 25 percent of global investors said they planned to increase allocation to North American assets and 31 percent planned an increase of European assets. Just 18 percent of global investors said they planned to increase their allocation to Asian assets.

Monterrey-based Jaguar Exploracion y Produccion de Hidrocarburos took a stake in over half the areas awarded, which the oil industry regulator said would eventually yield around $2 billion in investments over the 30-year lifespan of the contracts. A tie-up of Canada's Sun God Energia and Jaguar won six out of 10 areas available in the first of two tenders on Wednesday, the sixth and seventh auctions since a 2013-14 energy reform. There were no bidders for three of the areas. Bidding alone, Jaguar also scooped up another five areas in the second tender of 14 blocks, all of which were auctioned. Sun God Resources is based in Calgary, Alberta, while Jaguar is a Monterrey-based firm whose chief executive is Dionisio Garza, a well-known Mexican businessman. A consortium made up of Iberoamericana de Hidrocarburos Servicios and PJP4 de Mexico won one block in the initial auction and two in the second for a total of three. The second auction also saw a fresh push into Mexico by Asian investors, with a consortium of China's Shandong Kerui Oilfield Service Group with Mexico's Sicoval MX and Nuevas Soluciones Energeticas A&P; securing three areas. Slim's Carso Oil and Gas claimed two of the areas in the second tender, which saw a number of fields won by cash offers after more than one company made the maximum possible bid. Miguel Messmacher (R), a deputy finance minister, speaks to the media , during a news conference after an auction of offshore oil and gas blocks, in Mexico City, Mexico July 12, 2017.Henry RomeroNewpek, a unit of Mexican conglomerate Alfa, teamed up with U.S. firm Verdad Exploration Mexico to win two areas. The auctions are part of a constitutional reform to open up production and exploration to private investors with the aim of reversing a steady decline in oil output since 2004 and boosting anemic economic growth. The reform is starting to bear fruit. Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the oil regulator known as the CNH, told a news conference that including the $2 billion he expected the new contracts to generate eventually, the reform had now secured projected investments of around $60 billion. Slideshow (6 Images)The 21 areas should yield an extra 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) in crude production by 2025 as well as 378 million cubic feet per day of additional natural gas output, Zepeda said. That production should start coming online in 2019, he added. Deputy energy minister Aldo Flores forecast the new blocks would generate about 20,500 jobs in the next seven years. Earlier, Britain's Premier Oil said it had found potentially more than 1 billion barrels of oil off the coast of Mexico in the first shallow-water offshore well drilled by the private sector in the country since the reform. The areas on offer on Wednesday were discovered by state oil company Pemex, but have been stymied by underinvestment as the former monopoly focuses on mostly shallow and less-costly water oil and gas fields. They range from areas rich in natural gas in the Burgos basin in northern Mexico to fields that hold promise further south in the Gulf states of Veracruz and Tabasco.

Former U.S. President Barack Obama announced the lifting of the 20-year-old sanctions in January, a move that would suspend a trade embargo, unfreeze assets and remove financial punishments that have hampered the Sudanese economy. But the implementation of the move was delayed for six months to allow Sudan more time to make more progress on five demands. They included resolving internal military conflicts in areas such as war-torn Darfur, cooperating on counter-terrorism and improving access for humanitarian aid. Later on Thursday, the Arab League issued a statement expressing regrets for the delay and confirming its position on rejecting the sanctions.

Austria's Defence Ministry filed legal charges against Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium in February, alleging deception and fraud linked to the 2003 purchase. Airbus and the consortium, which includes Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Italy's Leonardo (LDOF.MI), have denied the accusations. Austria said last week it planned to end its $2 billion Eurofighter program early and replace it with a cheaper alternative. In a letter to Austrian Economics Minister Harald Mahrer dated July 11 and seen by Reuters, Airbus said efforts to criminalize business deals linked to the order threatened the reputation of aerospace suppliers. Airbus also defended Austria's Economics Ministry which had agreed to so-called  offset  deals associated with the order. Such deals, which are common practice in big international defense orders, seek to generate work for local firms.  The tendency to criminalize suppliers and their partners in such an internationally important order is not acceptable for us as an industry,  Airbus management representative for Austria, Peter Denker, said in the letter. He said  false allegations  undermined the reputation of the Economics Ministry and supplier industry. The Economics Ministry confirmed it had received the letter on Thursday but declined to comment. The letter keeps alive the row between Airbus and Austria over the fraud investigation, which has widened to include individuals including Airbus chief executive Tom Enders. In April, Enders described the handling of the allegations a  politically-motivated abuse of the legal system  and accused Austria's centrist coalition of using Airbus as an electoral  punching bag . Austria holds a parliamentary election in October. Some defense industry officials said the German CEO had overreacted and urged Airbus to take a less confrontational approach. Airbus could not immediately be reached to comment on the letter or a parliamentary inquiry, which was launched into how contracts were awarded. The inquiry ended on Wednesday and a final report is expected next week. In the letter, Airbus said:  For Airbus, our former parent company Daimler (DAIGn.DE), the other Eurofighter partners and the engine industry, the current politically motivated election campaign has long exceeded reasonable levels.  Greens lawmaker Peter Pilz, who initiated the parliamentary probe, said the inquiry had showed companies, including Airbus and Daimler (DAIGn.DE), should be prosecuted for possible fraud.

The Berlin-based start-up is different from rivals Apple , Spotify and Amazon in that it relies more on amateur musicians, for whom it provides a rare platform, and less on major commercial artists. But like them, it has yet to turn a profit. The big music labels on which most of the services depend - themselves under pressure from the shift to digital music - strike hard bargains. And SoundCloud - which said three years ago it had an audience of 175 million, a figure it has not updated - lacks either Spotify's large base of paying subscribers or the deep pockets of Apple and Amazon that can subsidise their music services. Last week, SoundCloud said it was firing 173 staffers and closing its London and San Francisco offices to focus on Berlin and New York.  We're on our path to profitability and in control of SoundCloud's independent future,  co-founder Alex Ljung wrote in a blog post. Technology website TechCrunch reported, however, that staff were told at a meeting this week that the layoffs only saved the company enough cash to hold out until the fourth quarter - a comment a company spokesman has now confirmed. He declined to comment on funding beyond the end of the year. The news has reignited speculation that SoundCloud will be acquired by a rival. It was targeted by Spotify last year in a bid that was later aborted. Spotify, recently valued at $13 billion, is now planning a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year or in early 2018, sources told Reuters in May.  The biggest problem I see is that the financial problems will absorb much of management's time in trying to raise more money, meaning that the real problems of the business go unaddressed,  independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note.  Of all the potential suitors, I think Google makes the most sense,  he said, noting SoundCloud's similarity to Google's YouTube in its focus on user-generated content.  Google will probably be most able to monetise what SoundCloud cannot.  SoundCloud, which was launched in 2008 and has never said how many paying subscribers it has, last month launched a budget subscription package in the hope of persuading more listeners to convert from the free service. SoundCloud raised $100 million last June from a group of investors including Twitter, valuing the company at roughly $700 million, according to Re/code. In March, it raised a further $70 million in debt from Ares Capital, Kreos Capital and Davidson Technology to meet its expected 2.5 times year-on-year revenue growth in 2017, a company spokeswoman said. Co-founder Alex Ljung said in a public interview at the Tech Open Air conference in Berlin this week that the company was fundraising, although he declined to comment on a rumour it was trying to raise $250 million.

Eni's leases, which were set to expire by the end of the year, were outside of an area protected by former President Barack Obama weeks before he left office. The company's plan to move ahead with risky and expensive drilling comes despite years of low oil prices and dangerous Arctic conditions. Royal Dutch Shell Plc quit its exploration quest offshore Alaska in 2015 after a ship it had leased suffered a gash in mostly uncharted waters and environmentalists had discovered an existing law that limited the company's ability to drill.

The financial index was the highest performer among the 11 major S&P; sectors, rising 0.48 percent. Quarterly earnings kick off on Friday with three of the biggest U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup reporting results. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings for S&P; 500 companies rose 7.8 percent from a year ago. Companies had their best profit performance since 2011 in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P; 500 healthcare index was up 0.23 percent, showing little reaction to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's unveiling of a revised healthcare bill.  Even if this bill is passed, there will be multiple iterations of healthcare legislation to come,  said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.  This is not a watershed moment like the Affordable Care Act, where it altered the healthcare industry,  he said. Hospital and insurer groups have been vocal against proposed Medicaid cuts which could result in lower revenues for hospitals like Community Health Systems Inc and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare and Centene Corp . Investors are eager to move past the healthcare bill and onto comprehensive tax reform, though Congress's ability to address it soon are in doubt, Cox said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16.86 points, or 0.08 percent, to 21,549, the S&P; 500 gained 4.22 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,447.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.28 points, or 0.16 percent, to 6,271.45. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told a Senate panel on Thursday that it would be  quite challenging  for U.S. growth to reach a 3-percent target set by President Donald Trump. Delta Air Lines Inc on Thursday reported a 21 percent drop in second-quarter profit because of sharply higher operating costs, despite higher passenger unit revenue, sending its shares down about 1.7 percent.

Thursday's decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan also rejected the Nationals' bid to reinstate a nearly $300 million award it had won from the panel, the Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee (RSDC), covering fees from the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network from 2012 to 2016.  But the Nationals called the decision a  major  victory in its battle for more than $100 million of disputed fees from MASN, which carries both teams' games but is controlled by the Orioles, for each of the 2012-2016 and 2017-2021 periods. Carter Phillips, a lawyer for the Orioles, said the team may appeal to New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals. New York Supreme Court Justice Lawrence Marks threw out the original award in November 2015, saying it was unfair because the Nationals' law firm Proskauer Rose had worked for Major League Baseball and executives from teams on the panel: the New York Mets, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Tampa Bay Rays. The judge last July then rejected the Nationals' bid to arbitrate again before the RSDC, whose membership has changed. But in Thursday's 3-2 decision, the Appellate Division said the Orioles, Nationals and MASN were contractually bound to resolve TV rights disputes before the panel.  The dissent's position that the new panel will remain puppets of MLB, rather than exercise its independent judgment, is pure conjecture,  though the original award was properly voided because of  evident partiality,  wrote Justice Richard Andrias, a member of the majority. Justice Rolando Acosta wrote in dissent that the dispute belonged before the American Arbitration Association, citing the commissioner's office's prior support for the Nationals' position.  MLB still controls nearly every facet of the RSDC and has shown itself - through its past conduct and the Commissioner's statements - to be incapable of protecting fundamental fairness  in the dispute, Acosta wrote. A 3-2 vote raises the likelihood the Court of Appeals will take up the case. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing the Nationals, said:  We look forward to finally having the rights fees determined in the forum the parties chose.

The number of people escaping has risen rapidly in recent weeks, Sajjad Malik, the U.N. refugee agency's representative in Syria, told Reuters.  They're coming out really weak, thirsty, and frightened,  he said, after visiting several camps for the displaced in northeast Syria.  Under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias is fighting to seize Islamic State's base in Syria.  With air strikes and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition, the SDF pushed into Raqqa in June after advancing on the city for months.  Fighting since late last year has displaced more than 240,000 people in the wider Raqqa province, most of them only in the last few weeks, Malik said.   They're traumatized (by) what they've seen,  he said.   Dead bodies all over the place. In some more destroyed neighborhoods, bodies still in that heat rotting on the street and in debris.      Recent advances along the Euphrates river, which borders the city from the south, have allowed the Kurdish-led SDF to completely encircle Islamic State inside Raqqa.  Some places do not even have enough drinking water anymore,  Malik said, after residents lost access to the river.  An estimated 30,000-50,000 people remain trapped in the city with Islamic State holding people there against their will, Malik said. Witnesses say the militants have shot at those trying to escape.  Those who are coming out now are paying enormous amounts of money, basically their lifelong savings, to smugglers to get them out,  he said.  They've left family members behind.  Many do not have enough money or could not bring elderly parents and sick relatives with them.  There is a conflict going on to eradicate ISIS but in the process we should try to protect (civilians),  Malik said, stressing the importance of getting them safe passage out.  Even after the  military endgame  in Raqqa, he added, people will have to grapple with a humanitarian crisis and severe trauma. Many children now fear the sound of aircraft.  This will take much longer ... to bring them back to some kind of normalcy,  Malik said.  The U.S.-led coalition says it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Ahead of the attack on the city, the U.N. human rights office raised concerns about increasing reports of civilian deaths. In a May report, it said there had been  massive civilian casualties ... and serious infrastructure destruction.  The U.N. refugee agency is expanding its work in northeast Syria as people begin to flee the province of Deir al-Zor. A camp south of the Kurdish-controlled city of Hasakah has already taken in 2,000 displaced people, Malik said.   Already, hundreds of them are coming out in trucks and buses,  Malik said.  Islamic State militants still control swathes of Syria's eastern desert bordering Iraq and most of Deir al-Zor, which would be its last major foothold in Syria after losing Raqqa.

The menacing comment by Philipps about Gina Miller was clearly racially motivated and as a result he has received a longer sentence today to reflect the hate crime element,  said Kate Mulholland, a prosecution lawyer. Philipps was convicted on two counts of sending a menacing public communication, one relating to Miller and one about an immigrant on benefits who had featured in a news article. Miller also criticized Facebook for not removing the post.  Facebook allowed the post to be published, and didn't take it down ... so Facebook are culpable,  Miller said.  If you think about them being a publisher, then they need to be reprimanded as well. And they've got away with it scot-free.  Facebook was not immediately available for comment.

The firm already had MBS expertise, thanks to partner Peter Calamari’s groundbreaking litigation for the insurer MBIA, and Quinn partner Shon Morgan was already advising Fannie on potential claims.  Selendy and Sheth laid out a grand vision in which Quinn Emanuel would use federal securities laws and the statute that created FHFA to go after the entire MBS industry in federal court. The banks would hire an army of lawyers to fight the suits, they told FHFA officials, but Quinn Emanuel pledged to match it.  “That was our goal, to level the playing field,” Selendy said in an interview Thursday.  This story, of course, has an ecstatic ending for FHFA. Quinn Emanuel (and conflicts counsel from Kasowitz Benson Torres) filed 18 suits for FHFA in 2011. As expected, the banks put up a ferocious defense, hiring a collection of prestigious securities lawyers to challenge FHFA on issues ranging from the timeliness of its filings to its loan-by-loan evidence of misconduct. Quinn and FHFA nevertheless won just about every skirmish, whether it was a discovery dispute, a bench trial or a petition for Supreme Court review.  As of Wednesday, when FHFA announced a $5.5 billion settlement with the Royal Bank of Scotland, the agency’s total recovery from MBS suits is more than $25 billion. The only remaining piece of the litigation is Nomura’s appeal of a post-trial judgment against the bank – and Reuters reported last November that FHFA seems poised to win that as well.  Quinn Emanuel did just fine, too. The firm worked on an hourly basis for FHFA, at what Selendy said was a discounted rate. He estimated that over the six years of the litigation, Quinn lawyers worked upward of 100,000 hours. As of late 2015, Quinn and Kasowitz had been paid $406.7 million, according to reporting by my Reuters colleague Nate Raymond. Selendy told me Thursday that the firms’ total amounts to less than 2 percent of FHFA’s recovery, but that’s $500 million.  As Selendy reflected on the six-year litigation in our interview, he emphasized that FHFA’s partnership with Quinn Emanuel doesn’t have to be a unique success for the federal government. He and his firm want other federal agencies (and state attorneys general) to learn from FHFA’s example that the government can leverage private lawyers’ expertise for the benefit of taxpayers.  “My hope is that the success of these cases will help spur” similar deals, Selendy said. “When there are cases when private counsel have perfected methods, it’s important for public agencies to consider that.” In particular, he said, the government should rely on private lawyers to take on cases involving “industries that are extremely well defended,” such as energy companies. But even in one-off cases, he said, federal agencies can replicate the FHFA model.  It’s important to remember that FHFA brought its civil suits against MBS issuers long before the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission went after the banks. FHFA and its law firms also pursued a different strategy than the rest of the federal government, reevaluating millions of underlying mortgage loans to show the entire MBS system was rotten. The agency and its lawyers had already won billions of dollars in settlements by the time the rest of the federal government reached its first MBS deal.  The federal government worked with private lawyers in at least two notable cases before Quinn Emanuel’s FHFA arrangement. In the early 1990s, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation hired David Boies, then at Cravath Swaine & Moore, to pursue claims stemming from the savings-and-loan crisis. The Justice Department subsequently brought Boies back into service for its antitrust litigation against Microsoft. State AGs frequently call upon private firms to handle novel or complex cases. The most famous example is their litigation in the 1990s against tobacco companies. Many states are now counting on private firms in litigation against pharmaceutical companies they blame for widespread opioid addiction.  After FHFA brought in Quinn and Kasowitz, the National Credit Union Administration hired private firms to prosecute its MBS claims on behalf of failed credit unions. Unlike the FHFA’s firms, NCUA counsel from Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Figel and Korein Tillery worked on a contingency basis. By October 2016, they had earned more than a $1 billion in fees, 23.4 percent of NCUA’s recovery of $4.5 billion.  Had Quinn Emanuel and Kasowitz worked on the same terms for FHFA, they would have earned $5.8 billion. But Selendy, who credited FHFA general counsel Alfred Pollard and deputy GC Stephen Hart for their pragmatism, said he has no regrets about his firm’s hourly billing arrangement with FHFA. His priority, he said, was that the government stood behind Quinn’s full-bore litigation strategy. The end result, he said, proves that the government received excellent value for the cost of using private firms – a message he said Quinn is very interested in sending to other agencies.  “This has been an honor,” Selendy said. “It’s a rare opportunity in the lifetime of a lawyer to combine private practice with public good.”  The trick now for Selendy and Quinn is to make those opportunities a bit less rare.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-fhfa-idUSKBN19Y2M7"},

So the 37-year-old, carrying the hopes of the Williams clan while her younger sibling takes time out to have a baby, should be forgiven a moment of self-doubt after a clinical victory over Britain's Johanna Konta on Thursday gave her a shot at another title.  Serena's always in my corner and usually it's her in these finals and I'm trying my best to represent Williams as best I can,  Venus told the BBC after her 6-4 6-2 win.  I missed (Serena) so much before this match and ... I just wish she was here and I wish she could do this for me. I was like, no, this time you do it for yourself. So here we are.  The SW19 major has been kind to both sisters, who have turned its manicured lawns into something of a personal fiefdom since the turn of the century. Seven of Serena's record 23 grand slam victories have come here. So have five of Venus's seven - the first as long ago as 2000 and the last in 2008. On Saturday the older Williams will seek to become the oldest major winner in the women's game since it turned professional, eclipsing her sister's record. Standing in her way will be Spain's Garbine Muguruza, who lost her previous Wimbledon final in 2015, to Serena.  One more win would be amazing. It won't be a given, but I'm going to give it my all,  Venus said.  We both play really well on grass. The last time she played Serena so I'll have to ask Serena for some pointers.

JLR said its three British plants were either full or at near capacity but the decision will spark fears the firm is looking to boost its output by using overseas operations, rather than invest in greater capacity at home. The British company, owned by India's Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), is rapidly expanding its production levels and model line-up and decided in 2015 to build a major new plant in Slovakia, rather than expand its operations in Britain.  Like much of the British car industry, JLR is also worried that Brexit could leave its car exports facing lengthy customs delays and tariffs of up to 10 percent, risking the viability of production in Britain.  Austrian contract carmaker Magna Steyr, a unit of Magna International (MG.TO), and JLR's plant in China, which is a joint partnership with Chinese automaker Chery, will produce the E-PACE.   With plans already in place to take Jaguar Land Rover’s three vehicle manufacturing plants in the UK close to their operating capacity, the creation of overseas manufacturing facilities delivers additional volumes needed to support the company’s future strategy,  the firm said in a statement.  It allows Jaguar Land Rover to offer its customers even more exciting new vehicles, to protect against currency fluctuations and to build a globally competitive business.    Magna will also produce the firm's previously announced first electric model, the I-PACE, from 2018, although JLR has said it wants to build low-emissions vehicles in Britain if certain conditions are met.

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued nine citations, several of which echo previous cautions by federal agencies at two other Exxon plants. The citations, issued in May, were seen by Reuters this month. A separate investigation by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) is ongoing and its report on the incident is due by year-end.  Exxon said it is contesting the OSHA citations and fines.  The facility was faulted five years ago by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to address corrosion on pipes and valves and for inadequate shutdown and emergency procedures provided to workers. The Nov. 22, 2016 explosion on a sulfuric-acid alkylation unit that makes octane-boosting components of gasoline in the sprawling Baton Rouge refinery and chemical plant injured four workers, two of them severely. Two of the affected workers declined to comment; others could not be reached. A worker on the alkylation unit removed the cover of a malfunctioning valve on an isobutane line and used a wrench to turn the value stem, Exxon reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality in a letter. Volatile isobutane is converted in the alkylation unit to a component of gasoline. As the operator turned the valve stem, portions of the valve fell out, releasing isobutane, according to the Exxon letter, which was ignited by a welding machine 70 feet away. One worker was knocked off a scaffold next to the alkylation unit and left dangling over the fire, according to two sources. Another worker was burned over most of her body. Exxon's safety procedures and training for operators on the alkylation unit were lacking, equipment was not properly maintained, and required inspections were not carried out within required time periods, according to a copy of the citations seen by Reuters.   We cooperated with OSHA's investigation and shared extensive information and records,  said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker.  We are contesting the citations and associated penalty.   Huffaker said  nothing is more important  to Exxon than maintaining a safe workplace for workers and residents near its facilities.   Eight of the nine citations were listed as serious, each carrying a fine of $12,675. The ninth, for failing to carry out external visual and ultrasonic inspections of piping, totaled  $63,373. The latter fine was higher because Exxon was cited in 2016 for violating the same inspection standard at a Baytown, Texas, refining and chemical plant complex, OSHA said in the citation. In a report issued in May after a two-year investigation of a 2015 explosion at an 86-year-old Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon, the CSB said the company lacked a procedure for operating a fluidic catalytic cracking unit in an idled mode, as was being done when the explosion took place. Exxon sold the Torrance refinery to PBF Energy Inc in July 2016.    In 2012, the EPA inspected the Baton Rouge refinery as part of a risk management prevention program. It found Exxon had not examined in five years more than 1,000 underground pipes, many of which were corroded, according to the agency's report on the inspection. The EPA also said emergency and shutdown procedures failed to provide needed details for operators.  Huffaker said in an email that Exxon contested the violations, and said the EPA withdrew all but two of its findings. She did not specify the two violations but said Exxon resolved those issues.

Stocks were buoyed in Asia and elsewhere a day after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled a rise in interest rates would be less aggressive than some investors had expected. Sentiment was boosted after China reported upbeat data on exports and imports for June, the latest sign that the global growth is picking up a bit. That offset reports of higher production by key members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), lifting oil prices. The data pushed Asian shares up more than 1 percent and lifted MSCI's 47-country gauge of global equity markets to a fresh record high with a gain of 0.29 percent.  Yesterday's move was in response to Yellen comments that should inflation remain below the 2 percent target rate, the central bank will be less aggressive in their tightening program,  said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.  Today, the market is saying that's old news and let's focus on the matter at hand, which is earnings that will be coming out in earnest this week,  Stovall said. U.S. shares rose in anticipation second-quarter earnings will grow 7.8 percent for S&P; 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters data. Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, will report results on Friday. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both rose about 0.4 percent, while Citigroup eased 0.27 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.75 points, or 0.11 percent, to 21,556.89. The S&P; 500 gained 4.08 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,447.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.57 points, or 0.09 percent, to 6,266.74. In Europe, the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares rose 0.29 percent to close at 1,518.91. Oil Gains Encouraging U.S. economic data initially supported the dollar. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week for the first time in a month and producer prices unexpectedly rose in June. The data likely will keep the Fed on track for a third interest rate increase this year. Yellen told a Senate panel on Thursday in a hearing focused on regulatory reform and a discussion of lagging productivity that it would be  quite challenging  for U.S. growth to reach a 3-percent target set by President Donald Trump. Oil prices rose after dropping in recent weeks to levels not seen since the end of last year as investors lost faith in a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers to reduce output. U.S. shale oil production also has risen sharply. Brent crude rose 68 cents to settle at $48.42 a barrel. U.S. light crude settled up 59 cents at $46.08. U.S. Treasury yields rose after falling for three straight days, tracking gains in German bond yields with solid U.S. economic data supporting their trend higher. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.3462 percent. The German 10-year Bund rose 2 basis points to yield 0.533 percent.

A new report issued Thursday by the New York Federal Reserve found that up to 35 percent of the recent dramatic decline in home ownership can be explained by the rising piles of loans millennials are taking out to finance their education, doing so at a time when government funding for colleges is waning and colleges are, in turn, subjecting students to massive hikes in tuition.  Student loans now average about $37,000 for graduates of the Class of 2016, with monthly payments for those loans preventing them from saving for a down payment and making monthly mortgage payments, freezing them out of the residential home market. The millennials are either turning into a permanent renter class or boomeranging back to childhood homes to live with mom and dad. Nearly 45 percent of people in their early twenties live with their parents, up from 33.5 percent in 2004, the Fed said.   Home ownership among young consumers dropped off rapidly  following the Great Recession, from 32 percent in 2007 to 21 percent in 2016. This occurred at a time of record-low interest rates when in most U.S. housing markets it was cheaper to buy a home than to rent.

Dicamba is sprayed by farmers on crops genetically modified to resist it but it has drifted, damaging vulnerable soybeans, cotton and other crops across the southern United States. Farmers have fought with neighbors over lost crops and brought lawsuits against dicamba producers. Arkansas banned its use last week and Missouri, which initially halted dicamba spraying, has joined Tennessee with tight restrictions on when and in what weather spraying can be done. Kansas is investigating complaints. Monsanto, which said it has spent years working to make dicamba stickier and limit drift when it is sprayed, is campaigning to overturn the bans. The company, together with BASF SE and DuPont , which also produce dicamba-based weed killers, has agreed to additional safeguards for product use, Missouri Director of Agriculture Chris Chinn said in a statement. Dicamba is key to Monsanto's biggest-ever biotech seed launch, which occurred last year. Its Xtend line of soybeans and cotton are designed to tolerate the weed killer, which replaces earlier products that contained only glyphosate. Some weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate, which Monsanto introduced in the 1990s. Crop seeds such as corn, soybeans and cotton are genetically modified to survive the pesticide while yield-sapping weeds die. Dicamba has long been used to kill weeds prior to the planting of crops, but its use has spiked this season across the United States after regulators last year approved it for crops that are already growing. Monsanto sells a new dicamba formulation under the name Xtendimax. The company says that Xtendimax drifts less than older versions. BASF and DuPont also sell less drift-prone formulations.

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued nine citations, several of which echo previous cautions by federal agencies at two other Exxon plants. The citations, issued in May, were seen by Reuters this month. A separate investigation by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) is ongoing and its report on the incident is due by year-end.  Exxon said it is contesting the OSHA citations and fines.  The facility was faulted five years ago by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to address corrosion on pipes and valves and for inadequate shutdown and emergency procedures provided to workers. The Nov. 22, 2016 explosion on a sulfuric-acid alkylation unit that makes octane-boosting components of gasoline in the sprawling Baton Rouge refinery and chemical plant injured four workers, two of them severely. Two of the affected workers declined to comment; others could not be reached. A worker on the alkylation unit removed the cover of a malfunctioning valve on an isobutane line and used a wrench to turn the value stem, Exxon reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality in a letter. Volatile isobutane is converted in the alkylation unit to a component of gasoline. As the operator turned the valve stem, portions of the valve fell out, releasing isobutane, according to the Exxon letter, which was ignited by a welding machine 70 feet away. One worker was knocked off a scaffold next to the alkylation unit and left dangling over the fire, according to two sources. Another worker was burned over most of her body. Exxon's safety procedures and training for operators on the alkylation unit were lacking, equipment was not properly maintained, and required inspections were not carried out within required time periods, according to a copy of the citations seen by Reuters.   We cooperated with OSHA's investigation and shared extensive information and records,  said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker.  We are contesting the citations and associated penalty.   Huffaker said  nothing is more important  to Exxon than maintaining a safe workplace for workers and residents near its facilities.   Eight of the nine citations were listed as serious, each carrying a fine of $12,675. The ninth, for failing to carry out external visual and ultrasonic inspections of piping, totaled  $63,373. The latter fine was higher because Exxon was cited in 2016 for violating the same inspection standard at a Baytown, Texas, refining and chemical plant complex, OSHA said in the citation. In a report issued in May after a two-year investigation of a 2015 explosion at an 86-year-old Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon, the CSB said the company lacked a procedure for operating a fluidic catalytic cracking unit in an idled mode, as was being done when the explosion took place. Exxon sold the Torrance refinery to PBF Energy Inc in July 2016.    In 2012, the EPA inspected the Baton Rouge refinery as part of a risk management prevention program. It found Exxon had not examined in five years more than 1,000 underground pipes, many of which were corroded, according to the agency's report on the inspection. The EPA also said emergency and shutdown procedures failed to provide needed details for operators.  Huffaker said in an email that Exxon contested the violations, and said the EPA withdrew all but two of its findings. She did not specify the two violations but said Exxon resolved those issues.

A new report issued Thursday by the New York Federal Reserve found that up to 35 percent of the recent dramatic decline in home ownership can be explained by the rising piles of loans millennials are taking out to finance their education, doing so at a time when government funding for colleges is waning and colleges are, in turn, subjecting students to massive hikes in tuition.  Student loans now average about $37,000 for graduates of the Class of 2016, with monthly payments for those loans preventing them from saving for a down payment and making monthly mortgage payments, freezing them out of the residential home market. The millennials are either turning into a permanent renter class or boomeranging back to childhood homes to live with mom and dad. Nearly 45 percent of people in their early twenties live with their parents, up from 33.5 percent in 2004, the Fed said.   Home ownership among young consumers dropped off rapidly  following the Great Recession, from 32 percent in 2007 to 21 percent in 2016. This occurred at a time of record-low interest rates when in most U.S. housing markets it was cheaper to buy a home than to rent.  That's a chief reason why homebuilders have increasingly turned towards move-up and luxury home building and away from starter homes: the buyers are just not there.

JLR said its three British plants were either full or at near capacity but the decision will spark fears the firm is looking to boost its output by using overseas operations, rather than invest in greater capacity at home. The British company, owned by India's Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), is rapidly expanding its production levels and model line-up and decided in 2015 to build a major new plant in Slovakia, rather than expand its operations in Britain.  Like much of the British car industry, JLR is also worried that Brexit could leave its car exports facing lengthy customs delays and tariffs of up to 10 percent, risking the viability of production in Britain.  Austrian contract carmaker Magna Steyr, a unit of Magna International (MG.TO), and JLR's plant in China, which is a joint partnership with Chinese automaker Chery, will produce the E-PACE.   With plans already in place to take Jaguar Land Rover’s three vehicle manufacturing plants in the UK close to their operating capacity, the creation of overseas manufacturing facilities delivers additional volumes needed to support the company’s future strategy,  the firm said in a statement.  It allows Jaguar Land Rover to offer its customers even more exciting new vehicles, to protect against currency fluctuations and to build a globally competitive business.    Magna will also produce the firm's previously announced first electric model, the I-PACE, from 2018, although JLR has said it wants to build low-emissions vehicles in Britain if certain conditions are met.

The blockade, which began more than a week ago at the BR-163 highway, is preventing trucks from unloading grains at the riverside hub of Miritituba, from where barges carry crops to Barcarena and Santarém ports before hitting export markets. The highway is the only route to Miritituba, the final stop for trucks carrying loads from Mato Grosso, which is currently harvesting its winter corn. Groups are protesting a veto by President Michel Temer of legislation that would reduce the area under protection at a national forest in Pará state. The situation underscores how Brazilian logistical woes hamper the country's efforts to consolidate its position as a reliable global commodities supplier. If disruptions persist, grain shipments at the port in Miritituba could ground to a complete halt by Friday, Abiove said.  Even if the blockades are called off and freight services resume at Miritituba, it would take several days to reorganize the flow of trucks and barges,  said Daniel Furlan Amaral, Abiove manager. Cancellation of shipping contracts at the port of Barcarena is  inevitable,  he said. Other northern ports such as Santarém can be fed through alternative waterways or railways, Amaral said. Abiove estimates 120,000 tonnes of grain are stored at warehouses in Barcarena, enough to load two ships.  The Brazilian unit of Bunge Ltd, which operates terminals at Miritituba and Barcarena, said in a statement the blockades would affect its grains shipping schedule and cause losses. Cargill Inc, which operates in Santarém, declined to comment and referred inquiries to Brazilian private ports association ATP, which has previously said it expects $47 million in losses this month from the protests. Brazil's cereals exporters association Anec estimated the disruptions could cost producers $400,000 per day and rerouting exports through southern ports would add 50 reais ($15.57) per tonne to freight costs. Anec data showed 30,000 tonnes of grains pass daily through Miritituba with final destination to the northern ports of Barcarena and Santarém. Anec estimates grain exports at these ports will reach 8.7 million tonnes this year. Northern ports including São Luiz, Itacoatiara, Santarém and Barcarena exported 19 percent of Brazilian corn and soy last year up from 17.2 percent in 2014, according to government data.

Canada's Frontera Energy Corporation now operates Block 192 in the Peruvian Amazon and is in talks with Peru about renewing its contract once the current one expires in September. U.N. Special Rapporteurs Baskut Tuncak and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, independent experts tasked with investigating human rights issues, said Peru had failed to clean up pollution from oil spills in the region and was not doing enough to ensure indigenous groups had a voice in talks.  The Peruvian Government must suspend the direct negotiations with companies until the right to free, prior and informed consent is guaranteed, and all environmental damage has been remedied,  Tuncak and Tauli-Corpuz said in a statement from the U.N. Human Rights Council. The remarks will likely be welcomed by indigenous rights activists in Peru who say a law requiring the government to include native groups in talks on projects affecting them has not been fully enforced. Peru's environment ministry and energy and mines ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In previous years, the government has declared several environmental emergencies in the region due to oil pollution. Frontera did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Peru's government has been trying to jumpstart investments in the country's oil industry that have dropped sharply since global oil prices fell and a series of ruptures largely shuttered the main pipeline serving the sector. The aging pipeline, operated by state-owned oil company Petroperu, suffered a new rupture this week, Petroperu said Wednesday. The company has blamed most of the dozen spills from the pipeline last year on attacks from unknown parties.  In June, Frontera reached a deal with indigenous people who had occupied Block 192 in a land-use dispute. The company agreed to pay them for use of land and finance community projects. Block 192 has produced an average of 2,565 barrels of oil per day this year, a sharp drop from previous years when it churned out some 10,000 bpd, according to data from state regulator Perupetro.

Trump has pledged to boost annual growth to 3 percent, the average for much of the last 70 years, and predicated an earlier tax plan on reaching that figure.  The Fed, the Congressional Budget Office and others feel that an aging population and lagging productivity mean the economy's potential has downshifted to around 2 percent growth or less - a fact that has profound effects on national wealth as the slower pace compounds over time.

In general, she said that moving annual productivity growth back above two percent - about double the pace of recent years - would be a monumental task. Growth in productivity and growth in the number of workers are key components of growth overall, and both are now moving slowly. Along with tax reform,  I would focus on training, on education...I would focus on investment both public and private.

There are now only 10 to 20 left in Slovenia's forests, down from between 50 and 70 about 20 years ago. An EU-funded project aims to revive the population by importing at least 10 lynxes from Slovakia and Romania between 2019 and 2024, project coordinator Rok Cerne told Reuters. It will also see the transfer of four lynxes from Romania and Slovakia to Croatia, where the lynx population is also low at about 40. About 60 percent of the 7 million euro ($8 million) project will come from EU funds. Around 60 percent of Slovenia is covered by forests, which are also home to relatively stable populations of bears and wolves.

Caixa Econômica Federal SA, Banco Santander Brasil SA, Banco do Brasil SA and Banco Bradesco SA are urging larger rival Itaú Unibanco Holding SA to join the plan, under which JBS would get a 12-month repayment extension in exchange for a 2 billion-real upfront payment and extra collateral, two of the people said. In principle, banks would not adjust the borrowing cost of those loans because the risk of JBS failing to honor them remains very small, according to one of the people, who asked for anonymity because the plan remains private. Bloomberg News reported on July 12 that a definitive accord had been struck. São Paulo-based JBS said in a statement that the company  remains engaged in a long-term relation with financial institutions, with which it has so far maintained productive and constructive talks.  The banks declined to comment. A refinancing deal is key to stem concerns of a potential liquidity strain at JBS, whose borrowing costs surged in the wake of the Batista family's decision to enter plea and leniency deals related to their involvement in a bribery and graft ring. Shares (JBSS3.SA) of the São Paulo-based meatpacker and food processor have tanked 18 percent since brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista agreed to a plea deal in mid-May. The company's 7.75 percent bond due in Oct. 2020 46611DAA3= shed up to 20 percent in the same period, sending yields on the security to an all-time high. Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista, the elder of the two brothers who control JBS, is personally negotiating the debt refinancing deal and asset sales to raise cash, the people said. JBS's private-sector banks remain skittish about their state peers' push to remove Batista, two of the people said. Itaú fretted about refinancing loans to JBS in early talks, demanding immediate repayment of a 1 billion-real credit facility due within weeks, the people said. Itaú is not participating in any of JBS's planned asset divestitures, one of the people said. Bribing Politicians Removing Batista has become common ground between government lenders BNDES and Caixa Econômica Federal, Reuters reported on June 22. BNDES owns 22 percent of JBS through investment arm BNDES Participações SA.  Caixa, Brazil's largest mortgage lender, is JBS's largest creditor. The refinancing underscores the challenge facing the Batista brothers, who over a decade transformed JBS from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's Midwestern plains into a global behemoth that operates in four continents, with the help of political relations and low-cost government loans. In May, the brothers admitted to bribing 1,893 politicians to facilitate the growth of JBS through BNDES loans. In a plea deal with prosecutors, both implicated President Michel Temer, unleashing a political crisis that threatens to derail the passage of key spending-cutting bills. JPMorgan Securities analyst Natalia Corfield estimates that JBS's total bank debt reached 24.3 billion reais at the end of March, of which about 17.5 billion reais would mature within the next 12 months.

A banking source told Reuters that the lenders first wanted to determine Etisalat Nigeria's free cash flow to help them value the telecoms business before deciding on whether to impair the assets or hold on to find new investors.  No bank is talking about restructuring now, but it might get to that later once we are able to ascertain the true value of the company,  the source said. Nigerian regulators intervened last week to save Etisalat Nigeria, the country's fourth-largest mobile operator, from collapse and prevent lenders placing the telecoms firm in receivership, prompting a board and management change. On Thursday, Etisalat Nigeria changed its name to 9mobile, the company said. The telecoms firm took-out a $1.2 billion loan four years ago from 13 local lenders to refinance an existing debt and expand its mobile network, but it struggled to repay due a currency crisis and recession in Nigeria. Banks involved in the loan deal include: Zenith Bank , GT Bank, First Bank, UBA , Fidelity Bank, Access Bank, Ecobank, FCMB, Stanbic IBTC Bank and Union Bank. Results are due from this month. GT Bank with $138 million in outstanding loans and Access Bank with $131 million are among the most exposed to Etisalat Nigeria.  We think that by the time the new management settles in, makes some changes and reduces costs, the company might bounce back,  the source told Reuters, adding that he expected support from the central bank, which has sought to avoid Etisalat Nigeria's collapse from sparking a wider debt crisis. Etisalat Nigeria's new chief executive Boye Olusanya told Reuters on Tuesday he was focused on getting the telecoms group back on track to make a profit, while working on the paperwork to eventually raise new capital. Renaissance Capital analysts estimates Etisalat Nigeria could be worth $1.2 billion based on an enterprise value to operating cashflow multiple when compared with South Africa's MTN and other African telecoms companies. Nigeria's banks are set to report interim earnings this month and investors will be watching for signs of a rise in non-performing loans. The banks collected half of their interest payment for May from Etisalat Nigeria so that the new team running the company has funds to keep it operating, the source said. And any provisioning may not kick in until the next quarter.  Given the understanding that Etisalat's debt was performing till the end of the first quarter we believe the banks ... might be required to make provisions in the second quarter,  said Olalekan Olabode, head of research at Vetiva Capital said.  Rather than converting the debt to equity, we expect to see a restructuring in the near term,  he added.

Trump, who has made few friends in Europe with his rejection of the 2015 Paris agreement and his  America First  trade stance, met with French President Emmanuel Macron as both leaders sought common ground to reset an awkward relationship.  Something could happen with respect to the Paris accords, let's see what happens,  Trump told a news conference.  If it happens, that will be wonderful, and if it doesn't, that'll be OK too.  Trump has said the Paris accord is soft on leading polluters like China and India, putting U.S. industry at risk.  I respect the wish to preserve jobs, I think that's compatible with the Paris accord,  Macron said at the joint conference.  There is no sudden and unexpected change today, otherwise we would have announced it, but there is the shared intention to continue discussing these issues,  the French president added.  Trump and Macron's relationship got off to a bumpy start, but both have an incentive to improve relations - Macron hopes to elevate France's role in global affairs, and Trump, seemingly isolated among world leaders, needs a friend overseas. Related CoverageFactbox: Trump on Twitter (July 13) - Paris, Emmanuel MacronMacron says U.S., France asked for 'concrete' initiative on SyriaTrump says discussed strengthening security cooperation with MacronTrump came to France beset by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, with emails released on Tuesday suggesting his eldest son welcomed an offer of Russian help against his father's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Weeks after Macron hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles, Trump will bask in the trappings of the Bastille Day military parade on Friday and commemorations of the entry 100 years ago of U.S. troops into World War One.  Macron welcomed Trump with a warm handshake and smiles, a contrast to the clenched-jaw greeting they shared at their first encounter in May.

This is so beautiful,  the U.S. president told Macron as they met at the Hotel des Invalides where Napoleon Bonaparte and other French war heroes are buried. Syria Cooperation For the 39-year-old Macron, France's youngest leader since Napoleon two centuries ago, the visit is a chance to use soft diplomacy to win Trump's confidence and set about influencing U.S. foreign policy, which European leaders say lacks direction. Macron views it as counter-productive to isolate the United States on the world stage, and said he and Trump had asked diplomats to draw up in the coming weeks a concrete initiative aimed at preparing the future of Syria. Slideshow (22 Images) On the Iraq-Syria situation, we have agreed to continue working together, in particular on the building of a roadmap for the post-war period,  Macron said. Trump said work was underway to negotiate a ceasefire in a second region of Syria. On Friday, Trump will be guest of honor at France's July 14 celebrations, a year after a Tunisian man loyal to Islamic State ploughed a truck through revelers on a seafront promenade in Nice, killing more than 80. During the U.S. election campaign, Trump said a wave of militant attacks showed  France is no longer France , and reprimanded the then-Socialist government for allegedly bowing its head to jihadists. In bringing Trump to Paris, Macron has stolen a march on Britain's embattled Prime Minister Theresa May. London's offer of a state visit for Trump met fierce domestic criticism and warnings that he would be greeted by mass protests. An Elabe poll showed that 59 percent of French people approved of Macron's decision to invite Trump.

The privately held company, which is in the second year of a restructuring, said results were higher in each of its four business segments and revenue hit a two-year high.  The structural improvements we've made, as well as favorable conditions in some markets, have yielded strong results,  Chief Executive Officer David MacLennan said in a statement. Expectations have been high for a wave of consolidation and partnering within the grain trading industry following a string of weak results by some companies. Minnesota-based Cargill said net income rose to $347 million in the fourth quarter ended May 31 from $15 million a year earlier. Excluding special items, operating earnings came to $460 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $19 million. Revenue rose 4 percent to $28.3 billion. Agribusinesses like Cargill and rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd and Louis Dreyfus Co [LOUDR.UL], known collectively as the ABCDs of global grain trading, capitalize on moving commodities from areas of surplus to areas of deficit, but ample global supplies limited those opportunities. However, low crop prices have also led to lower meat prices. Cargill's profit from animal nutrition and protein rose for the fourth straight quarter on strong retail beef demand in North America and brisk exports. It was the largest contributor to quarterly earnings.  In 2017, beef prices are lower than they were in 2016. That makes beef competitive relative to other proteins,  Chief Financial Officer Marcel Smits told Reuters by phone.  Now that beef has become more accessible, consumers have taken a renewed interest and we see per capita consumption going up.  Origination and processing results rebounded as slow crop sales by South American farmers helped boost U.S. grain and oilseed exports. Cargill's food ingredients segment also reported higher results for the fourth straight quarter, while industrial and financial services results rebounded. Cargill said it had invested $1 billion and made $700 million in divestitures as part of its restructuring. Last month Cargill completed the sale of its petroleum business and agreed to sell its power and natural gas business to Australian investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd. It also sold the last of its four U.S. cattle feedlots and a Canadian egg processor.

Origination and processing results rebounded as slow crop sales by South American farmers helped boost U.S. grain and oilseed exports. Cargill's food ingredients segment also reported higher results for the fourth straight quarter, while industrial and financial services results rebounded. Cargill said it had invested $1 billion and made $700 million in divestitures as part of its restructuring. Last month Cargill completed the sale of its petroleum business and agreed to sell its power and natural gas business to Australian investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd. It also sold the last of its four U.S. cattle feedlots and a Canadian egg processor.

Briton Froome, who hammered the opposition in the first big mountain stages in 2013, 2015 and 2016 -- the years he won the title -- could not match the pace of the top guns in the finale in Peyragudes, surrendering the yellow jersey to Italian Fabio Aru. Frenchman Romain Bardet, runner-up last year, won the stage to stay third overall, 25 seconds behind Aru, while Froome slipped to second, six seconds off the pace.  It was a very, very hard finish. I didn't have the legs in the finale, but there is still a long way to go,  Froome told reporters.  I had a bad moment here at the end. No excuses. I just didn't have the legs in the final. It's close. It's going to be a great fight now all the way to Paris.

The Viability Rating (VR) has also been affirmed at 'bb+'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs, SR, SRF AND SENIOR DEBT CBD's IDRs, SR and SRF reflect the extremely high probability of support available to the bank from the UAE and Dubai authorities if needed. Fitch's view of support factors in the sovereign's strong capacity to support the banking system, sustained by sovereign wealth funds and on-going revenues mostly from hydrocarbon production, despite lower oil prices, and the moderate size of the UAE banking sector relative to the country's GDP. Fitch also expects high willingness from the authorities to support the banking sector, which has been demonstrated by the UAE authorities' long track record of supporting domestic banks, as well as close ties and part government ownership links of a number of banks. CBD's SRF is one notch below the UAE Domestic Systemically Important Banks's (D-SIB) SRF of 'A', due to Fitch's view that CBD is less systematically important. This is based on CBD's 2.5% market share of total assets in the UAE banking system at end-2016, and the bank's niche corporate focus. The senior unsecured notes issued under CBD (Cayman) Limited (100% owned subsidiary) are rated in line with the bank's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same rating drivers. VR CBD's VR reflects its high problem loans ratio (which includes impaired loans + restructured loans + 90 days past due but not impaired loans), adequate reserve coverage, small niche franchise, adequate management and strategy, average capital ratios, stable funding and liquidity, and declining profitability ratios. CBD's VR is constrained by the bank's weak asset quality. Impaired loans and problem loans ratios are high, despite continued improvement over the preceding four years. Reserves for impaired loans have improved, and covered 102% of impaired loans and 78% of problem loans at end-2016. CBD's sizeable loan concentrations, although a common characteristic for UAE banks, also constrain the VR. CBD has a niche franchise, with a well-entrenched corporate banking franchise, but limited diversification into retail banking, SME finance and Islamic banking. CBD's market share limits the bank's pricing power and competitive advantage (2.5% and 2.8% of total UAE banking system assets and deposits, respectively, at end-2016). CBD has average capital ratios (the Fitch Core Capital ratio was about 14% at end-2016) relative to other Fitch-rated UAE banks. CBD's management intends to keep the total regulatory capital ratio above 14%. At end-2016, the Tier 1 regulatory ratio was 14.6%. The total regulatory capital ratio was 15.8%. If capital above the minimum regulatory requirement is added to loan loss reserves, then the loan loss reserve/gross loans ratio increases to 11.6% from 7.0%, giving a satisfactory capital buffer. Fitch views CBD's funding profile as generally stable. Despite funding concentrations, the deposit base is slightly weighted towards term deposits, and provides a fairly stable funding base for the short to medium term. CBD complements its deposit funding with two issues under the bank's EMTN programme, medium-term repurchase agreements and a syndicated loan, demonstrating good access to capital markets when required. CBD has a large stock of liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents, short term interbank placement and liquid securities) equivalent to 22% of deposits and short-term borrowings, providing a good liquidity cushion. CBD's loans to deposits ratio is in line with peers. Earnings and profitability metrics have been declining, and are now below peers. Fitch's key earnings and profitability metric, operating profit/ risk weighted assets, shows a deterioration of the bank's operating profitability to 1.8% at end-2016 from 2.7% at end-2013. A combination of a narrowing net interest margin attributable to an increase in the cost of funding and rising loan impairment charges have gradually consumed more of the bank's operating profit. RATING SENSITIVITIES- IDRs, SR, SRF AND SENIOR DEBT CBD's IDRs, SR and SRF are sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of the UAE and Dubai authorities on their propensity to support the banking system or the bank. The two senior unsecured notes issued under CBD's Euro medium-term notes programme via CBD (Cayman) limited are rated in line CBD's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same sensitivities. VR A downgrade of the VR could result from significant deterioration in asset quality leading to weaker capital ratios. An upgrade may result from further diversification of the franchise and a sustained improvement in asset quality.

Richard Rojas, 26, pleaded not guilty to second degree murder, second degree attempted murder and first and second degree assault, prosecutors said. A grand jury indicted him on May 24.   Rojas, a Navy veteran, drove his Honda sedan down Seventh Avenue on May 18 and made a U-turn, mowing down pedestrians on sidewalks for three city blocks before crashing, prosecutors said. His lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. Alyssa Elsman, an 18-year-old woman visiting from Michigan, was killed, while 22 other pedestrians suffered various injuries, some serious. After the car crashed, the driver was subdued by onlookers and police as he tried to flee on foot.   Rojas previously told the New York Post in a tearful jailhouse interview shortly after the crash that he had unsuccessfully sought psychiatric care and had no recollection of the incident. He was believed to be under the influence of some intoxicating substance, a police source previously told Reuters, while law enforcement officials told ABC News he was apparently high on synthetic marijuana. Rojas has had numerous run-ins with the law over the past decade, according to Navy and public court records. He has had at least four prior arrests, including two for drunken driving and one for allegedly threatening a man with a knife outside his apartment in New York City's Bronx borough. While serving in the Navy in 2013, he spent two months in a military jail in South Carolina, though records do not disclose the reason.

The smiling Australian's signature celebration involves the pouring of podium champagne into a sweaty racing boot, which an unlucky victim is then urged to share in front of a global audience. With the Red Bull driver having notched up five podiums in a row, including a surprise victory in Azerbaijan at the end of June, the world has been watching plenty of shoeys this season. At the last two races, Azerbaijan and Austria, they were instigated more by podium interviewers - former racers David Coulthard and Martin Brundle - than the happy driver.  I honestly didn’t plan on doing it. Even in Baku I was, like, 'ah, I won't do it',  Ricciardo told reporters on Thursday when asked about his plans for Sunday's British Grand Prix.  DC (Coulthard) took my shoes off and then in Austria Martin was frothing for it. I feel like there's some real sick bastards around here. I never thought it would continue like this.  Ricciardo said fans were even shouting  shoey  during an  F1 Live  promotional event in central London on Wednesday.  I'm just walking along, minding my business and they're like 'do a shoey'...I don't actually just take my shoe off while I’m walking in the street and drink out of it. I feel like I dug a hole for myself with this one,  he grinned.  On that note, I feel like it's been fun. I want to say it's run its course; we'll see what happens.  In Austria, while television commentator Brundle drank deeply from the shoe, Mercedes' race winner Valtteri Bottas made himself scarce. Ricciardo was unimpressed, even if he conceded that the shoey could be risky when races were back-to-back because the top three could all pick up something that put them in hospital for a week.  I heard the Finns drink. I really heard that. But Valtteri did not carry his flag well last Sunday,  he said.  Shame on him. Wow. Valtteri Bottas. Disappointed. That's it. No more shoeys.  Triple world champion Lewis Hamilton, Bottas's teammate and Sunday's race favorite, was with the Finn.  I still stand firm on the toe jam stuff,  he said.  The juice from the foot is not something I wish to drink. Especially someone else's.

Countries that fail to comply with the new protocols or take steps to do so within 50 days could face travel sanctions. The cable, sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday, is a summary of a worldwide review of vetting procedures that was required under Trump’s revised March 6 executive order that banned U.S. travel by most citizens from six predominantly Muslim countries. The memo lays out a series of standards the U.S. will require of other countries, including that they issue, or have active plans to issue, electronic passports and regularly report lost and stolen passports to INTERPOL. It also directs nations to provide  any other identity information  requested by Washington for U.S. visa applicants, including biometric or biographic details. The cable sets out requirements for countries to provide data on individuals it knows or has grounds to believe are terrorists as well as criminal record information. Further, countries are asked not to block the transfer of information about U.S.-bound travelers to the U.S. government and not to designate people for travel watchlists based solely on their political or religious beliefs.  This is the first time that the U.S. Government is setting standards for the information that is required from all countries specifically in support of immigration and traveler vetting,  the cable said. The cable lays out risk factors the U.S. government will consider when evaluating a country. Some of these are controversial and could be difficult for countries to prove to U.S. satisfaction, including ensuring  that they are not and do not have the potential to become a terrorist safe haven.  Countries are also expected to agree to take back citizens ordered removed from the United States. If they do not provide the information requested, or come up with an adequate plan to do so, countries could end up on a list to be submitted within 50 days to Trump for possible sanction, including barring  designated categories  of their citizens from entering the United States. The new requirements are the latest in a series of steps the Trump administration says it is taking to better protect the United States from terrorist attack. The most controversial of these are two executive orders, challenged in federal court, which impose a temporary ban on travel to the United States for most citizens from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. While the orders were initially blocked from being enforced, the Supreme Court on June 26 allowed the ban to go into effect for people from the six nations with no strong ties to the United States. The cable requires countries to act quickly.  Failure to provide this information in a timely manner will require us to assume your country does not meet the standards,  the cable said, stressing that the United States would work with foreign nations to assess if they meet the standards and, if not, come up with a plan to help them do so. The cable asks that U.S. diplomats  underscore that while it is not our goal to impose a ban on immigration benefits, including visas, for citizens of any country, these standards are designed to mitigate risk, and failure to make progress could lead to security measures by the USG, including a presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of certain categories of foreign nationals of non-compliant countries.  The cable says the U.S. government has made a preliminary determination that some countries do not meet the new standards and that others are  at risk  of not meeting them. It does not name these, listing them in a separate, classified cable. The State Department declined comment on the cable, saying it would not discuss internal communications.  The U.S. government’s national security screening and vetting procedures for visitors are constantly reviewed and refined to improve security and more effectively identify individuals who could pose a threat to the United States,  said a U.S. State Department official on condition of anonymity.  We welcome every opportunity to continue to review and improve our systems and procedures,  the official added.

Rhodri Philipps, who inherited the title viscount from his father, offered 5,000 pounds on Facebook to anyone who  accidentally  ran over Gina Miller, whom he described as a  bloody troublesome first generation immigrant . Miller received death threats after her campaign to force the government to get parliamentary approval for withdrawal from the European Union. The legal suit succeeded in ensuring a parliamentary vote but has not stopped Brexit going ahead. She said that the sentence was too lenient and that Philipps should have been charged with a more serious crime, such as inciting racial violence, which would have sent a stronger message to online abusers.  I think the severity of an attempt to have me killed is much more than just a malicious communication,  Miller told Reuters.

The menacing comment by Philipps about Gina Miller was clearly racially motivated and as a result he has received a longer sentence today to reflect the hate crime element,  said Kate Mulholland, a prosecution lawyer. Philipps was convicted on two counts of sending a menacing public communication, one relating to Miller and one about an immigrant on benefits who had featured in a news article. Miller also criticized Facebook for not removing the post.  Facebook allowed the post to be published, and didn't take it down ... so Facebook are culpable,  Miller said.

The idiomatic expression seems to derive from the idea that when selling a home, everything that's not affixed to the plumbing can be carted off. In the business context, bosses rip out the approaches of their predecessors, including sometimes even the proverbial washbasin. Donald Trump's attempt to apply the strategy to the American presidency isn't working.  These are usually two-quarter exercises in the corporate world. They often include some combination of a revision of company strategy, significant writedown or sale of assets, restatement of financial accounts, replacement of senior executives and changes in guidance about future prospects.  Among recent examples, think Valeant Pharmaceuticals, where Joseph Papa reversed a strategy of gobbling up rival drugmakers. Or consider how John Cryan began his reign at Deutsche Bank with a big loss. Similarly, hark back to the mother of all kitchen sinks in 2003, when new Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons took a $98.7 billion charge to write off the acquisition of America Online two years earlier led by the man he replaced.  Trump, who wraps up his second quarter as president in two weeks, brought a similar approach to the affairs of government. He has ripped up high-profile deals signed by President Barack Obama and is seeking to shred his signature healthcare plan. He also signed numerous executive orders undoing Obama's accomplishments, and generally sought to diminish his two-term legacy. The catch is that Trump is fast running out of his forerunner's policies to savage.  Investors tend to give new bosses some leeway to reconfigure their firms and castigate previous management. Eventually, however, they expect to see a fresh vision, with clear results taking shape, usually in the form of a rising stock price. Having made his pitch to the U.S. electorate as the first businessman president, it's not unreasonable to hold Trump to similar standards.  That means the New York real-estate developer and reality-TV star will need to pivot quickly from simply blaming Obama, or George W. Bush for that matter, to formulating a blueprint from which he can build prosperity and stability. In normal times, that's hard. When battling the institutions of democracy on a daily basis, amid a law-enforcement investigation into possible electoral collusion with Russian government entities, it may be impossible.  Still, should the president style himself a turnaround artist, he is fortunate to have many corporate analogs to study. Valeant is one. Just months after replacing Michael Pearson at the helm of the acquisitive drug company, Papa came out with crummy results and cut the troubled company's full-year financial guidance. The stock tanked on the announcement, which a Breakingviews colleague labeled a classic  throwing in the kitchen sink.   Papa then started unraveling Pearson's strategy, which largely consisted of acquiring rivals, slashing their research and development budgets and jacking up drug prices. He is now focused on Valeant's dermatology, eyecare and gastrointestinal units. To pay down debt, Papa embarked on a series of asset sales. Last month, Valeant sold iNova Pharmaceuticals in Australia for $930 million.  The fruits of these efforts are beginning to appear. Papa has promised to cut Valeant's $28.5 billion debt load by some $5 billion no later than the first quarter of 2018. Investors are coming around to his harsh remedies. Hedge-fund boss John Paulson, for one, increased his position in the stock, and is now the largest shareholder. Over the past three months, Valeant's shares have vaulted 82 percent. That's because Papa has not merely trashed his predecessor, but provided a design for Valeant's future.  A similar story has played out at Deutsche Bank since Cryan was named CEO two years ago. Like Papa at Valeant, Cryan quickly took a financial hit. He announced a $7 billion loss by writing down the value of Bankers Trust, which Deutsche Bank had acquired 16 years earlier. The move was seen as symbolic of Cryan's desire to conduct a kitchen-sink transformation of the German lender. He then cleared the bank's top ranks.  Shortly thereafter, Cryan moved beyond undoing decisions of previous bosses Anshu Jain, Juergen Fitschen and Josef Ackermann by, for instance, pledging to reduce Deutsche Bank's headcount by some 23,000 jobs. While the stock still trades below its book value, it has gained a third over the past year. The point is, Cryan like Papa and other incoming corporate commanders in chief swiftly moved beyond the blame game to formulate credible strategic plans of action designed to improve the organizations they run.  Since his inauguration in January, Trump has almost exclusively focused on undoing everything from the Paris climate accord to the Trans-Pacific Partnership on trade. Next he hopes to sign a bill from the Republican-controlled legislature that repeals, and maybe replaces, the Affordable Care Act. Equally, Trump has gone beyond assembling his own cabinet, as all presidents do, and fired career officials including the FBI chief and prosecutors at the Department of Justice.  The president naturally faces a different set of pressures than public companies, where the stock price provides a real-time verdict on management. A 6 percent decline in the dollar against the euro since Trump's inauguration may, however, provide something of a proxy. Trump could argue he needs another quarter to fully flush out the complicated plumbing of the previous occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. After that, though, his agenda will start rapidly circling down the drain if that's all he's got to offer the American people.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Shares of the Snapchat parent have slumped since a red-hot March IPO, falling below their initial sale price on Monday and hitting a record low of $15.21 two days later after a lead underwriter downgraded its rating on the stock. Traders in the options market have responded to the latest drop in Snap shares as an opportunity to load up on call options, said Fred Ruffy, analyst at New York-based options Analytics firm Trade Alert.  Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and usually are used to place bets on shares rising, while put options give the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future. Call options betting on Snap shares topping $16 by mid-October were the most actively traded contracts this week, followed by contracts looking for the shares to move above $17 by July 21, according to Trade Alert data.  Buying interest in call options with strike prices above the current stock price is often a sign that players are positioning for a short-term move higher in the stock,  said Ruffy. While open put contracts still outnumbered calls, pointing to significant bearish positioning, that options-based measure of sentiment has become less defensive this week. There are 1.3 puts open for each open call, the fewest since mid-May and down from 1.5 puts on Monday, Trade Alert data showed on Thursday. Snap shares were up 3 percent to $15.71 on the day after brokerage Stifel upgraded its rating on the shares to  buy  from  hold  and reaffirmed a $22 price target.  We believe Snap's business remains on track fundamentally as it continues to develop innovative consumer products and increasingly sophisticated tools for advertisers,  Stifel analysts said in a note. Snap's shares took a tumble in early May after the company reported slowing user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a public company. Investors are also eyeing the expiration later this month of a lockup period that has so far restricted company insiders and IPO backers from selling Snap shares.  Analysts at Stifel, however, said that investor concerns about the looming end of the lockup period could have more of an impact on the share price than any actual insider selling after the expiry.

Canada's Frontera Energy Corporation now operates Block 192 in the Peruvian Amazon and is in talks with Peru about renewing its contract once the current one expires in September. U.N. Special Rapporteurs Baskut Tuncak and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, independent experts tasked with investigating human rights issues, said Peru had failed to clean up pollution from oil spills in the region and was not doing enough to ensure indigenous groups had a voice in talks.  The Peruvian Government must suspend the direct negotiations with companies until the right to free, prior and informed consent is guaranteed, and all environmental damage has been remedied,  Tuncak and Tauli-Corpuz said in a statement from the U.N. Human Rights Council. The remarks will likely be welcomed by indigenous rights activists in Peru who say a law requiring the government to include native groups in talks on projects affecting them has not been fully enforced. Peru's environment ministry and energy and mines ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In previous years, the government has declared several environmental emergencies in the region due to oil pollution. Frontera did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Peru's government has been trying to jumpstart investments in the country's oil industry that have dropped sharply since global oil prices fell and a series of ruptures largely shuttered the main pipeline serving the sector. The aging pipeline, operated by state-owned oil company Petroperu, suffered a new rupture this week, Petroperu said Wednesday. The company has blamed most of the dozen spills from the pipeline last year on attacks from unknown parties.  In June, Frontera reached a deal with indigenous people who had occupied Block 192 in a land-use dispute. The company agreed to pay them for use of land and finance community projects. Block 192 has produced an average of 2,565 barrels of oil per day this year, a sharp drop from previous years when it churned out some 10,000 bpd, according to data from state regulator Perupetro. U.S. oil company Occidental Petroleum Corp produced oil from Block 192 for decades before Argentine energy company Pluspetrol took over operations in 2001.

Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) was dealt a blow last month when Britain's media secretary, Karen Bradley, said she was persuaded that the deal could give the Murdochs too much influence over the media, after regulator Ofcom assessed the impact of the transaction. Murdoch also owns the Sun and Times newspapers in Britain.  Bradley said she would make a final decision on July 14, giving some investors hope that Fox could avert a full investigation if it offered concessions to protect the editorial independence of Sky's 24-hour TV news channel, Sky News.  A person familiar with the deal said however the company was unlikely to offer any new remedies, opting instead to let the competition watchdog examine the deal.  Murdoch, 86, and his family have long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal which forced them to abandon that bid. Britain's political leaders have long sought the backing of Murdoch and his newspapers and any attempt to expand his media empire in the country sparks intense political scrutiny. Rupert's son James, who is chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, said in March that worries about his family exerting too much power were unfounded in an era of online providers such as Facebook, Buzzfeed, Netflix and Google. Fox has said any referral for an in-depth probe could mean the deal would not close before next June. Both Sky and Fox declined to comment.

The two, Giuseppe Profiti and Massimo Spina, respectively the former president and treasurer of the Vatican-owned Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome, were ordered to stand trial, a statement said. The first hearing was set for July 18. The indictment accuses the two men of spending 422,000 euros ($481,000) in 2013 and 2014 on refurbishing the large Vatican apartment of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who was not indicted. Profiti and Spina made no immediate comment. Bertone, 82, was the Vatican secretary of state for most of the pontificate of former Pope Benedict and was one of the most powerful men in the Holy See. He was removed from office in 2013, eight months after the election of Pope Francis. The renovation work started a few weeks later on the spacious property, which is next door to the Vatican guest house, where the pope lives in a modest suite.  FILE PHOTO: Vatican State Secretary Italian Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone (R) bows his head to Pope Benedict XVI during his pastoral visit in Loreto, Italy October 4, 2012.Max Rossi/File PhotoThe indictment of two people close to Bertone indicated that Vatican prosecutors were determined to pursue even delicate cases, a Vatican official said, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to discuss details of the case. Profiti and Spina risk prison sentences of three to five years if convicted, under Vatican laws on conspiracy to commit a crime and misappropriation of funds. Slideshow (2 Images)Bertone's comfortable lifestyle clashed with that of the pope, who shunned the large papal apartments in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace and has urged Church prelates to lead humble, frugal lives. When the Vatican confirmed last year that Profiti and Spina were under investigation, a lawyer for Bertone said the cardinal had never asked for, nor authorized payment for the restoration work from hospital funds. Hospital officials said at the time that Bertone had given 150,000 euros of his own money to Bambino Gesu to make amends for damage done to the hospital's image. According to the Vatican indictment, Profiti and Spina diverted the money directly to the head of the Italian construction company that did the work inside the Vatican. The Bambino Gesu, considered one of Italy's best pediatric hospitals, is in Rome but has extra-territorial status as part of the Vatican, a sovereign state. It was founded by a wealthy Italian family in 1869 and donated to the Vatican in 1924.

The FCC wants a reliable verification system that would prevent scam artists from spoofing the number of a bank, debt collector, government tax agency or other organizations to trick consumers into disclosing confidential financial or account information. One report estimates U.S. consumers get 2.5 billion monthly robocalls - automated, prerecorded calls that regulators have labeled a  scourge.  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said  Americans are mad as hell  at robocalls, which represent the top source of consumer complaints. He said he thinks the agency's actions could make a significant dent in the volume of calls and said the FCC is acting as  an aggressive cop on the beat.  Fellow Commissioner Mignon Clyburn agreed.  Given the severity and complexity of the unwanted robocall problem, this agency recognizes that it must take a multi-pronged approach, to address this persistent problem,  Clyburn said. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) logo is seen before the FCC Net Neutrality hearing in Washington February 26, 2015.Yuri GripasThe FCC also wants to prevent unwanted calls after a person gets a reassigned phone number. The agency said there is no single resource with up-to-date phone numbers, and wants public comment on how providers should report when a phone number has been reassigned and how the data could be used. When a consumer cancels an account, the number is returned to a carrier and often reassigned. The agency also voted to begin drafting rules to prevent consumers from being switched to a different phone provider without their permission or having unauthorized charges added to bills. The FCC may require a phone carrier check directly with the consumer before switching an account, rather than relying on a second carrier’s request for the change. Separately, the FCC voted 2-1 to fine New Mexico-based Dialing Services $2.88 million for facilitating  unlawful robocalls  after an investigation in 2012 found the company had made millions of unwanted calls. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, the FCC proposed a $120 million fine on a Florida resident after it alleged his operation made almost 100 million robocalls in a three-month period to trick consumers with  exclusive  vacation deals from well-known travel and hospitality companies. Last year, the FCC formed a task force of more than 30 major technology and communications companies seeking to eliminate robocalls but the group did not propose a comprehensive fix.    Carriers cannot block all robocalls or texts because some may be legitimate communications from schools, weather alerts, utilities, political calls and others.

Under U.S. law, the State Department must notify Congress every 90 days of Iran's compliance with the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Trump has a congressionally mandated deadline of Monday to decide. The landmark 2015 deal struck with Iran by the United States, France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany is aimed at preventing Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon by imposing time-limited restrictions and strict international monitoring on its nuclear program. In return, Tehran won relief from punishing international economic sanctions. If Trump does state Iran is in compliance, it would be his  second time since taking office in January to do so despite his promise during the 2016 campaign to  rip up  what he called  the worst deal ever.  The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Trump could always change his mind. Iran denies seeking nuclear arms. However, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded in December 2015 that Iran worked on the design of a missile-borne nuclear warhead until 2009. While lifting nuclear-linked sanctions, the United States maintains sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program, human rights record and what Washington charges is its support for international terrorism.

The complaint with the Federal Election Commission was signed by Common Cause, the Campaign Legal Center, Democracy 21 and two campaign lawyers involved with those groups. It identified as respondents the Trump campaign and Trump Jr. Common Cause filed a complaint earlier this week with the agency. Thursday's complaint added three attendees at the meeting: Manafort, who was Trump's campaign manager at the time, Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and Rob Goldstone, who arranged the meeting. The complaint takes advantage of information disclosed in email exchanges with Trump, Jr., son of President Donald Trump, that detailed how and why the meeting in 2016 was arranged.  The Federal Election Commission is the only federal agency that can bring civil charges for violations of the campaign finance law. However, because the panel requires bipartisan agreement to move forward on any actions, critics have expressed concern that the agency was unlikely to take action.  Democrat U.S. Representative Grace Meng wrote to the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday asking it to take up Common Cause's first complaint against Trump Jr. The organizations said in Thursday's complaint that the emails provided evidence that Trump Jr. violated the law by asking a foreign national for something of value, which they argue the law would define as  including the fruits of paid research, hacking, or similar investigatory activity.    The evidence is clear that Don Jr. knew that the offer of opposition campaign research came from the Russian government, and the law is clear that giving such valuable research for free would have been a contribution to the Trump campaign,” said Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center. The complaint said that Manafort and Kushner, by attending the meeting knowing the subject matter, are also at fault.   Donald Trump, Jr. and the White House have insisted there was no wrong doing. Democratic lawmakers want the Federal Election Commission to bring civil charges against Donald Trump, Jr., saying the meeting violated the law.  The Department of Justice could bring criminal charges.  Reporting by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Chris Sanders","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-complaint-idUSKBN19Y2G3"},

The FCC first approved 1 GHz of spectrum in 1995 for motor vehicles to use radar that allowed for the introduction of collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control systems that are credited with preventing tens of thousands of crashes annually. Thursday's decision expands the band that vehicle radars can operate to 5 GHz of spectrum and will improve lane departure warning, blind spot detection systems, automatic braking and pedestrian detection, the FCC said. In 2016, some 20 automakers reached a voluntary agreement with U.S. auto safety regulators to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment by 2022, a move that could eliminate 1 million crashes a year. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the agency was giving automakers  the bandwidth needed  to allow  proven technologies that enable services like collision avoidance, blind spot monitoring, and lane change assistance  and allow for  new innovations.  Automakers will exit some other smaller portions of spectrum used for some radar systems as part of the expansion after 2022, the FCC said. The vote harmonizes vehicle spectrum with European rules that could allow automakers to bring technologies to the U.S. market faster, the FCC said. The decision will also lead to improved aviation safety by boosting foreign object debris detection radars on airport runways and aircraft wingtip radars that can help avoid collisions with objects while moving on airport grounds. The move was prompted by a petition filed by German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH in 2012. Continental AG (CONG.DE) said the expanded spectrum will allow for  better range separation, range accuracy, angular accuracy, and reliable object discrimination.  FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly voted for the change but  noted automakers were granted another block of spectrum in 1999 for vehicle-to-vehicle communications, but it has gone largely unused. In December, the U.S. Transportation Department proposed requiring future new cars and trucks to be able to  talk  to one another, but it has not been finalized. Automakers are pursuing technologies to assist drivers in avoiding crashes while working on fully self-driving cars. U.S. traffic deaths jumped 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, following a spike in 2015 when road deaths had their highest full-year increase since 1966. In 2015, total U.S. traffic crashes rose by 4 percent to 6.3 million. Editing by Matthew Lewis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fcc-autos-idUSKBN19Y2FQ"},

The deal marks another pullback from Uber's breakneck global expansion, a year after its exit from China, though it does have potential upside for the Silicon Valley online taxi hailing  pioneer, based on its 36.6 percent stake in the merged company. For months, Uber has struggled with legal setbacks, accusations of a sexist work culture and driver protests, culminating in the June departure of co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick under investor pressure. Shares in Russia's largest internet company leapt almost 20 percent as investors bet the deal could accelerate the move of Yandex's taxi business into profitability. Thursday's agreement follows the recent merger of rival Russian taxi players Fasten and Rutaxi, marking a rapid consolidation of the market.  With this deal Yandex eliminates an aggressive competitor  which, in the long run, will lead to improved monetization and profitability,  said Sergey Libin, an analyst with Raiffeisen Bank in Moscow.  It's a good deal.  San Francisco-based Uber has agreed to invest $225 million   (13.5 billion rubles) while Yandex will contribute $100 million into a new joint company in which Yandex will own 59.3 percent and employees will have a 4.1 percent stake. In a joint statement, Yandex and Uber said they would join forces in Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan to create a new company operating in 127 cities, in a deal expected to close in the fourth quarter. Yandex.Taxi Chief Executive Tigran Khudaverdyan will become the CEO of the combined business and Yandex will consolidate the new company's results in its financial statements. Yandex will hold four board seats, with Uber holding three, they said. Uber will contribute its UberEATS food delivery business in the six-country region to the new venture.   There is ride-sharing and food delivery and beyond that there are also numerous opportunities in logistics that we will explore,  Yandex Chief Financial Officer Greg Abovsky said on an investor call. Abovsky added the combined company could be spun off with a separate stock listing in a few years. The share move for Yandex, known as the  Google of Russia  for its dominance of the region's web search, maps and mobile navigation markets, signals that roughly half of the company's market capitalization lies in investor hopes for its taxi unit. Otkritie brokerage analyst Timur Nigmatullin estimated that, before the deal, Yandex.Taxi represented around 20 percent of the parent company's market capitalization. Otkritie estimated the combination could push the taxi business into profitability by 2018 or 2019. Based on the valuation of the combined company and Yandex's share in it, he said the taxi business now accounted for up to 50 percent of Yandex's equity value, which after Thursday's 18.75 percent rise hovered about $10.5 billion. Lucrative Deal FILE PHOTO: A yandex taxi is seen in central Kiev, Ukraine, May 16, 2017.Gleb Garanich /File PhotoUber said the merger did not imply a strategy of further retrenchment elsewhere. Indeed, financial terms of the deal make it a lucrative one, it said.   This is an exciting opportunity in a unique situation and our operations in other countries will not be affected,  Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, the head of Uber in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a blog post addressed to Uber employees. Gore-Coty said Uber's 36.6 percent stake was worth $1.4 billion, based on an agreed valuation of $3.725 billion for the combined company. That marks a sizeable gain on the $170 million Uber invested since entering the region three-and-a-half years ago, even with the new $225 million investment. Uber sold its Chinese business to far larger local rival Didi Chuxing a year ago in return for a 17.5 percent stake in Didi which as a whole was then valued at $35 billion.  Slideshow (2 Images)While Uber no longer exists in China, the paper value of its stake in Didi has risen to around $8 billion from $6.1 billion, based on Didi's recent funding round valued at $50 billion. Improved Driving Conditions The unified business in Russia and nearby markets also helps Uber become more sustainable, Gore-Coty said, by helping it cut losses as part of a global drive toward eventual profitability. Uber said in May its net loss, excluding employee stock options and other items, narrowed in the first quarter to $708 million from $991 million in the fourth quarter. This week, it told investors that losses continued to decline in the second quarter, a source familiar with the report said. The ownership stakes reflect how Yandex.Taxi is roughly twice the size of Uber in the region as measured both in terms of rides and gross bookings, the companies said. Yandex and Uber compete in Russia with rivals including Fasten/Rutaxi, Maxim and Gett, the Israeli startup backed by German automaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). Yandex.Taxi, which was founded in 2011, is active in 127 cities across the region. Uber, founded in 2009, is active in 16 cities in Russia and five cities in Azerbaijan, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Uber does not now operate in Armenia or Georgia. Russia's federal anti-monopoly regulator said the deal could pose risks to competition and a thorough analysis was needed before it could be approved, local news agencies reported.  Following completion, passengers will be able to continue to use either Yandex or Uber apps. The driver apps of the two companies will be integrated into a single app for greater efficiency, the companies said. Uber operates in nearly 600 cities worldwide.

The stock drop reversed positive gains earlier in the week driven by investor optimism about improving passenger unit revenue in the sector. The closely-watched metric measures sales relative to flight capacity.        Breaking a losing streak that has plagued much of the industry for the last two years, Delta posted a 2.5 percent increase in passenger unit revenue, but that performance was overshadowed by the carrier's poorer-than-expected bottom line. While positive unit growth is a bright spot for investors, stocks were slightly down sector-wide on Delta's results. The cost of fuel and mounting labor expenses, prompted in large part by renegotiated contracts with carriers' pilots, flight attendants and mechanics unions, added a sobering drag on an otherwise uplifting industry outlook on passenger unit revenue.

On an adjusted basis, the No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic earned $1.64 per share, compared to the analyst consensus forecast of $1.67, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company were down 2 percent at $54.35. Delta's unit revenue is expected to continue trending positive into the third quarter, with the carrier forecasting growth between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent. That progress is expected to boost the company's operating margins between 18 percent and 20 percent from the prior year. Delta said operating expenses climbed during the second quarter on higher salaries and fuel costs, its two biggest cost components. The airline paid an additional $338 million toward 2017 profit sharing with employees.  The June quarter represented the peak for non-fuel cost pressures this year and we expect our CASM (cost per available seat mile) trajectory to moderate to approximately 2 percent for the September quarter,  Delta Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said in a statement. Aircraft fuel related expenses rose 18 percent to $1.45 billion during the quarter, while salary costs were up 9 percent to $2.62 billion. Delta's operating margin in the June quarter, excluding special items, rose slightly to 18.4 percent, compared to 17.4 percent last year.  Total operating revenue rose 3.3 percent to $10.79 billion.

The 2018 fiscal year budget, unveiled in May, put numbers on Trump's vision of a government that would boost military spending while radically cutting assistance to lower-income Americans. The annual budget deficit in 2027 would be about $720 billion under Trump's proposal, the CBO said in a report, not eliminated as promised by the White House, which has projected a $16 billion surplus. There was no immediate reaction to the report from the Trump administration. But in a pre-emptive strike on Wednesday, the White House wrote on Twitter:  Faulty Numbers = Faulty Results.  Trump's budget, which slashes funding for the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and disabled, is unlikely to become law in its current form. Related CoverageU.S. budget deficit reaches $90 billion for JuneRepublicans who control the U.S. Congress - and the federal purse strings - will decide whether to make the politically sensitive cuts. Senate Republicans unveiled revised healthcare legislation on Thursday as part of their party's long-running effort to scrap the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare..  The Senate legislation retained the previous draft bill's phaseout of Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid and sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025. The changes to Medicaid have been a point of political contention among Republican lawmakers. The CBO estimated that Trump's budget would cause the federal budget deficit to shrink relative to the size of the economy over the next 10 years, ranging between 2.6 percent to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product during that period. The cumulative federal deficit would be one-third smaller than CBO baseline projections that show deficits rising to 5 percent of GDP by 2027, the CBO said. The CBO said the Trump budget's deficit reduction over the next decade would be lower than the White House projects due to lower estimated revenues and slower economic growth than assumed by the administration. The CBO said did not take into account all of Trump's proposals that may affect the economy because  the details on many of the proposed policies are not available at this time.  The administration's tax reform proposal, for example,  lacked the specificity necessary to evaluate any effects,  the CBO wrote. The deficit reduction created by Trump's budget proposal would result from lower spending over the next decade, the CBO said. The White House blueprint would cut $2 trillion in mandatory spending, including $1.9 trillion on healthcare. About $1.25 trillion of that is linked to a bill already  passed by the House or Representatives to repeal and replace Obamacare. Trump's budget also proposes saving $610 billion over the next decade by overhauling the Medicaid program, the CBO said.

Shares of the Snapchat parent have slumped since a red-hot March IPO, falling below their initial sale price on Monday and hitting a record low of $15.21 two days later after a lead underwriter downgraded its rating on the stock. Traders in the options market have responded to the latest drop in Snap shares as an opportunity to load up on call options, said Fred Ruffy, analyst at New York-based options Analytics firm Trade Alert.  Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and usually are used to place bets on shares rising, while put options give the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future. Call options betting on Snap shares topping $16 by mid-October were the most actively traded contracts this week, followed by contracts looking for the shares to move above $17 by July 21, according to Trade Alert data.  Buying interest in call options with strike prices above the current stock price is often a sign that players are positioning for a short-term move higher in the stock,  said Ruffy. While open put contracts still outnumbered calls, pointing to significant bearish positioning, that options-based measure of sentiment has become less defensive this week. There are 1.3 puts open for each open call, the fewest since mid-May and down from 1.5 puts on Monday, Trade Alert data showed on Thursday. Snap shares were up 3 percent to $15.71 on the day after brokerage Stifel upgraded its rating on the shares to  buy  from  hold  and reaffirmed a $22 price target.  We believe Snap's business remains on track fundamentally as it continues to develop innovative consumer products and increasingly sophisticated tools for advertisers,  Stifel analysts said in a note. Snap's shares took a tumble in early May after the company reported slowing user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a public company. Investors are also eyeing the expiration later this month of a lockup period that has so far restricted company insiders and IPO backers from selling Snap shares.  Analysts at Stifel, however, said that investor concerns about the looming end of the lockup period could have more of an impact on the share price than any actual insider selling after the expiry.

If Trump does state Iran is in compliance, it would be his  second time since taking office in January to do so despite his promise during the 2016 campaign to  rip up  what he called  the worst deal ever.  The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Trump could always change his mind. Iran denies seeking nuclear arms. However, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded in December 2015 that Iran worked on the design of a missile-borne nuclear warhead until 2009.

Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) was dealt a blow last month when Britain's media secretary, Karen Bradley, said she was persuaded that the deal could give the Murdochs too much influence over the media, after regulator Ofcom assessed the impact of the transaction. Murdoch also owns the Sun and Times newspapers in Britain.  Bradley said she would make a final decision on July 14, giving some investors hope that Fox could avert a full investigation if it offered concessions to protect the editorial independence of Sky's 24-hour TV news channel, Sky News.  A person familiar with the deal said however the company was unlikely to offer any new remedies, opting instead to let the competition watchdog examine the deal.  Murdoch, 86, and his family have long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal which forced them to abandon that bid. Britain's political leaders have long sought the backing of Murdoch and his newspapers and any attempt to expand his media empire in the country sparks intense political scrutiny. Rupert's son James, who is chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, said in March that worries about his family exerting too much power were unfounded in an era of online providers such as Facebook, Buzzfeed, Netflix and Google. Fox has said any referral for an in-depth probe could mean the deal would not close before next June. Both Sky and Fox declined to comment.

The 2018 fiscal year budget, unveiled in May, put numbers on Trump's vision of a government that would boost military spending while radically cutting assistance to lower-income Americans. The annual budget deficit in 2027 would be about $720 billion under Trump's proposal, the CBO said in a report, not eliminated as promised by the White House, which has projected a $16 billion surplus. There was no immediate reaction to the report from the Trump administration. But in a pre-emptive strike on Wednesday, the White House wrote on Twitter:  Faulty Numbers = Faulty Results.  Trump's budget, which slashes funding for the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and disabled, is unlikely to become law in its current form. Related CoverageU.S. budget deficit reaches $90 billion for JuneRepublicans who control the U.S. Congress - and the federal purse strings - will decide whether to make the politically sensitive cuts. Senate Republicans unveiled revised healthcare legislation on Thursday as part of their party's long-running effort to scrap the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare..  The Senate legislation retained the previous draft bill's phaseout of Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid and sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025. The changes to Medicaid have been a point of political contention among Republican lawmakers. The CBO estimated that Trump's budget would cause the federal budget deficit to shrink relative to the size of the economy over the next 10 years, ranging between 2.6 percent to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product during that period. The cumulative federal deficit would be one-third smaller than CBO baseline projections that show deficits rising to 5 percent of GDP by 2027, the CBO said. The CBO said the Trump budget's deficit reduction over the next decade would be lower than the White House projects due to lower estimated revenues and slower economic growth than assumed by the administration. The CBO said did not take into account all of Trump's proposals that may affect the economy because  the details on many of the proposed policies are not available at this time.  The administration's tax reform proposal, for example,  lacked the specificity necessary to evaluate any effects,  the CBO wrote. The deficit reduction created by Trump's budget proposal would result from lower spending over the next decade, the CBO said. The White House blueprint would cut $2 trillion in mandatory spending, including $1.9 trillion on healthcare. About $1.25 trillion of that is linked to a bill already  passed by the House or Representatives to repeal and replace Obamacare. Trump's budget also proposes saving $610 billion over the next decade by overhauling the Medicaid program, the CBO said.

The FCC first approved 1 GHz of spectrum in 1995 for motor vehicles to use radar that allowed for the introduction of collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control systems that are credited with preventing tens of thousands of crashes annually. Thursday's decision expands the band that vehicle radars can operate to 5 GHz of spectrum and will improve lane departure warning, blind spot detection systems, automatic braking and pedestrian detection, the FCC said. In 2016, some 20 automakers reached a voluntary agreement with U.S. auto safety regulators to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment by 2022, a move that could eliminate 1 million crashes a year. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the agency was giving automakers  the bandwidth needed  to allow  proven technologies that enable services like collision avoidance, blind spot monitoring, and lane change assistance  and allow for  new innovations.  Automakers will exit some other smaller portions of spectrum used for some radar systems as part of the expansion after 2022, the FCC said. The vote harmonizes vehicle spectrum with European rules that could allow automakers to bring technologies to the U.S. market faster, the FCC said. The decision will also lead to improved aviation safety by boosting foreign object debris detection radars on airport runways and aircraft wingtip radars that can help avoid collisions with objects while moving on airport grounds. The move was prompted by a petition filed by German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH in 2012. Continental AG (CONG.DE) said the expanded spectrum will allow for  better range separation, range accuracy, angular accuracy, and reliable object discrimination.  FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly voted for the change but  noted automakers were granted another block of spectrum in 1999 for vehicle-to-vehicle communications, but it has gone largely unused. In December, the U.S. Transportation Department proposed requiring future new cars and trucks to be able to  talk  to one another, but it has not been finalized. Automakers are pursuing technologies to assist drivers in avoiding crashes while working on fully self-driving cars. U.S. traffic deaths jumped 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, following a spike in 2015 when road deaths had their highest full-year increase since 1966.

Their separate meetings with Michel Barnier were not negotiations, they said - Barnier stressed he will conduct those only with Prime Minister Theresa May's government, starting with a full round of talks in Brussels next week.  My door is open, listen to all Brexit views,  he tweeted, while adding:  Next week negotiations with UK gov(ernment).  But the trio - Labour Party leader Corbyn; Carwyn Jones, the Labour first minister of Wales; and Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish nationalist first minister in Edinburgh - all said they made cases for keeping close EU ties to protect jobs. Such demands could disrupt the Conservative May's plans to push the new legislation through a parliament where she lost her majority in a snap election last month.  This is not about holding separate Scottish negotiations,  Sturgeon said in a statement, adding that she told Barnier she wants May to change tack and keep Britain in the single market.  However, meetings like this are helpful in developing a mutual understanding between the Scottish government and the EU.  Britain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn arrives for a meeting with European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, July 13, 2017.Olivier Hoslet/PoolScots voted heavily against Brexit but after the election Sturgeon backed away from calling a quick new vote on secession, fearing it would end in a defeat similar to the 2014 referendum rather than an independent Scotland free to join the EU. Jones noted that the EU is the destination for two thirds of exports from Wales, where a majority of people voted for Brexit. He said in a statement:  It is absolutely vital that we retain full and unfettered access to the single market. It would be irresponsible to turn our back on this.  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon arrives for a meeting with European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, July 13, 2017.Olivier Hoslet/PoolEU leaders have made clear that full membership access to the single market is only open to countries, like non-EU member Norway, which are open to free immigration from the bloc. That was something Corbyn said Labour was not willing to accept - instead it wants  managed migration  and to avoid what he called  undercutting  of wages and standards by eastern immigrants. Corbyn called his lunch with Barnier  very informative  and said he used the opportunity to explain Labour's decision to back Brexit after opposing it during the 2016 EU referendum, while aiming to hold May to a course that would protect workers.  We're not negotiating,  he told reporters.  We're forming an opinion of what the European Union wants in this and representing views of people who voted for us, in particular on protection of jobs.  He criticized government plans that he said were an attempt to limit parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit legislation. Corbyn said that, unlike May, he would offer EU residents full rights after Brexit unilaterally - without making it conditional on the EU doing the same for Britons on the continent. Asked whether Labour was willing to pay the tens of billions of euros which Brussels says Britain will owe to cover existing commitments to the EU budget when it leaves, Corbyn was less dismissive than some of May's ministers.  We'll pay what we are legally obliged to pay,  he said, while stressing that he had no figures in mind and that no figures were discussed with Barnier.

It is one of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever passed through parliament and is a major milestone in the process of our withdrawal from the European Union,  Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement. The government also fleshed out its negotiating stance with the EU, publishing three position papers which underlined that Britain would quit nuclear body Euratom and leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. May faces a battle even within her own Conservative Party to stick to her plan of a clean break. Pro-Brexit lawmakers will give her little room for movement, while pro-Europeans are looking to soften the divorce terms.

If she fails, her position could swiftly become untenable. Road To  Hell  The publication of the bill is the first step in a long legislative process to ease Brexit, which is stretching the government with the sheer volume of issues to cover. A report by the government's spending watchdog said Britain's planned new customs system, essential to smooth trade, might not be ready in time for Brexit, adding to a list of concerns over the government's plans. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves Downing Street, London, Britain July 11, 2017.Peter Nicholls We have been clear from the outset that we are putting the resources in place, have got the resources in place that we need to deliver on Brexit,  May's spokesman told reporters. The parliament has yet to set a date to debate the bill, which will be closely examined to see how the government plans to carry out the difficult and time-consuming technical exercise of transposing EU law. The bill set out powers for ministers, with the approval of parliament, to correct laws to ensure they work after being brought into British law. These powers will exist until two years after the day Britain leaves. A government document, released alongside the bill, offered the example of current town and planning regulations which now refer to  other EEA (European Economic Area) states . That would need to be changed to  EEA states , dropping the 'other', for the regulations to work. In other areas, existing laws require Britain to seek an opinion from the European Commission before a project is approved - something also that will need to be changed. Lawmakers have expressed concern that the sheer volume of work could limit their ability to scrutinize the changes effectively and fear the government will introduce policy change by the back door.  The main opposition Labour Party has said it would oppose the bill unless it met six conditions, including guarantees for workers' rights. Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said he would work to soften May's stance, promising the prime minister that  this will be hell . The bill will also face scrutiny from British companies, many of which have spent the year since Britons voted by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU trying to figure out how the change will affect their business.  A legislative transition of this scope has never before been undertaken,  Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said in a statement.  We will be keeping a watchful eye for the possibility of unintended consequences that lead to new burdens or compliance costs.

But the 26-year-old's trademark smile was back in place by the time she articulated her thoughts about the sobering 6-4 6-2 semi-final defeat - along with the conviction that her ascent through the tennis firmament is only just beginning.  She was just, quite frankly, better than me today... I think I definitely have a lot more to improve on...,  Konta told reporters.  But I definitely feel like there's no reason why I would not be able to be in a position to win a title like this one day.  That confidence seems to have drawn extra strength from the wave of support that has built for her over the past 10 days, reaching a crescendo after men's world number one Andy Murray, so often the focus of British hopes at the sharp end of the Wimbledon fortnight, crashed out in the quarter-finals. Fans calling her a role model was  humbling , she said, and progressing to a second major semi-final - she also made the last four at the Australian Open in 2016 - put her in a better place to help raise the sport's profile.  I'd like to think that Andy (Murray) has inspired both girls and boys to play. I'd like to think that I'm doing the same... I will only ever try to do that in a positive way.  And the same goes for her own game. Told she would break into the world's top five on Monday, she said:  I guess it's a nice club to be a part of. But, again, I'm looking to keep getting better.

While they increased allocation to emerging markets by nearly $52 billion in the first quarter of 2017, U.S.-domiciled active managers still have just 5 percent of assets under management allocated to emerging market equities, data from research firm eVestment shows. Globally, non-U.S. active funds have about twice the exposure to emerging market stocks, at around 9.94 percent, the eVestment data shows. European-domiciled funds have nearly three times the weighting as their U.S. counterparts at 14.8 percent.   A lot of our clients, particularly on the private client side are U.S. (dollar)-denominated … they do have a home bias and we reflect that home bias in our portfolios,  said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy for Glenmede Trust Company.  Meanwhile, MSCI's all-country world index's weighting to emerging markets has grown to 11.15 percent as of May 2017, from 7 percent in 2006, as more emerging market companies met standards for investable assets. By being so underweight, American investors have missed big gains since emerging market stocks pulled out of a five-year bear market in early 2016. Since then, MSCI's emerging markets index has surged nearly 48 percent, handily outpacing the S&P; 500's 30-percent gain in the same period. Such caution also reflects emerging markets' long-term volatility. Over the past 18 months of outperformance, emerging markets investors have had to stomach about 35 percent more volatility, Reuters data shows.  Follow the Growth? But with global economic growth trends favoring the fast-growing asset class, investors will need to move into emerging markets to continue reaching gains above 5 percent in bond and equity portfolios, said Krishna Memani, chief investment officer at OppenheimerFunds. That sentiment was echoed by more than a dozen fund managers interviewed by Reuters who collectively manage hundreds of billions of dollars.  In a growth-short world, emerging markets are going to be the primary source of growth for the foreseeable future,  Memani said.  That is decades.  Emerging economies are expected to grow between 5 percent and 7 percent a year over the next five years and to represent 45 percent of global GDP by 2020, up from 35 percent in 2010, according to data from the Institute of International Finance (IIF). They could represent as much as 60 percent in 15 years. Developed market economies like the United States and Western Europe are expected to expand around 2 percent annually through 2020. Much of the growth of emerging markets has come from China, which will be more open to investors after MSCI announced in June it would include the country's domestic shares in its emerging markets index starting next year. While few question the growth trajectory of emerging economies, not all fund managers agree that equates to long-term asset outperformance.  There is this narrative that you hear a lot that just by divine order EM is going to outperform developed markets because they're growing faster,  said Tina Byles Williams, chief executive and chief investment officer of FIS Group.  We don't think that. None of those things are necessarily untrue, but market dynamics change (over time).  Linda Bakhshian, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Federated Investors Inc, says that for her clients, who are more conservative, the returns are not consistent enough to merit significantly increasing allocation.   To invest in EM you need to have reliable information,  Bakhshian said.  It takes a lot of resources that I could dedicate to other areas that will provide a better return for what I’m looking for.  Not as Sticky Volatility and long-term underperformance has long led investors to think of EM as a short-term tactical tool to boost returns at the margins rather than a long-term, strategic investment. Indeed, over the past 20 years, MSCI's emerging index's rise of about 80 percent has delivered less than half the gain of the S&P; 500's 164 percent. Emerging markets also have a problem with remaining sticky for foreign investors, according to Emre Tiftik, IIF's deputy director in the capital markets and emerging markets policy department. When developed economies encounter hard times, emerging markets are among the first assets sold. Money piled out of emerging markets after the global financial crash of 2008, investors further pulled out after the European debt crisis of 2011, and the largest migration from EM came after the Federal Reserve announced in 2013 that it would begin to reduce its bond-buying program.  The debate over the merits of investing in emerging markets is also present between asset managers and clients, many of whom remain skittish about emerging markets.  We definitely do our part in terms of our research and all the discussions we have on a regular basis with our clients to tell them, ‘Based on our analysis EM is a great place to invest right now,'  said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, BlackRock's chief multi-asset strategist.  But ultimately it’s their decision.    Reporting by Dion Rabouin; Editing by Christian Plumb and Nick Zieminski","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/emerging-markets-investors-idUSL1N1JO1V0"},

The United States called on China to release prisoners of conscience and free his widow, Liu Xia, who remains under house arrest.  Today, I join those in China and around the world in mourning the tragic passing of 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died while serving a lengthy prison sentence in China for promoting peaceful democratic reform,  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. His death was announced in a brief statement from the authorities in Shenyang, the northeastern city where he was being treated for late-stage liver cancer after being transferred from prison to hospital last month. France, Britain and Germany joined calls from Washington for Liu Xia to be allowed to travel and leave the country if she wished, and criticised Beijing for not having allowed Liu to travel abroad for treatment. The Norwegian government, which resumed full diplomatic relations with Beijing in December after they were put on ice due to the Nobel award to Liu Xiaobo, said in a one-paragraph statement it was saddened by Liu's death.  It is with deep grief that I received the news of Liu Xiaobo's passing,  Prime Minister Erna Solberg said.  Liu Xiaobo was for decades a central voice for human rights and China's further development.  Berit Reiss-Andersen, the leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee which awards the prize, said Liu would remain  a powerful symbol for all who fight for freedom, democracy and a better world . And she criticised Western governments for not being vocal enough in support of Liu before his death.  It is a sad and disturbing fact that the representatives of the free world, who themselves hold democracy and human rights in high regard, are less willing to stand up for those rights for the benefit of others,  she said. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said China and the world had  lost a principled champion who devoted his life to defending and promoting human rights, peacefully and consistently, and who was jailed for standing up for his beliefs . China's state news agency Xinhua reported Liu's death in a brief story in English, but not Chinese. References to his passing were swiftly removed from Weibo, the country's answer to Twitter, though images and comments were shared on the WeChat messaging service. Fellow dissident and artist Ai Weiwei was vocal in his criticism of Beijing. Liu Xiaobo was not a criminal,  he told Reuters in his Berlin studio.  He was a writer, an intellectual and he used his life to find ways to make society better.  Asked whether the Chinese government had contributed to Liu's death by preventing him from receiving treatment abroad, Ai said:  China showed how brutal its society can be.

Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) 9501.1 would also speed up a final decision on the future of a nearby plant, Fukushima Daini, that suffered only minor damage, Chairman Takashi Kawamura, 77, said in an interview with foreign media.(For a graphic on Japan nuclear reactor restarts click tmsnrt.rs/1UTT0Tk)  I'm very sorry that Tepco has been prolonging making a decision,  Kawamura, a former chairman of conglomerate Hitachi Ltd (6501.T), said.  Just like tritium, we will aim for an earliest possible conclusion.           Kawamura, who previously sat on a government panel looking into the Fukushima cleanup, said he believed Japan needed to keep operating nuclear power plants for future generations and as part of national security. The nationalization of nuclear power plants was a matter that could be discussed in the future as national policies had a role in the operations of nuclear power, he added, but did not elaborate. Tepco wants to release the tritium-laced water currently stored in hundreds of tanks at Fukushima into the ocean - common practice at normally operating nuclear plants - but the company is struggling to win approval from local fisherman. Missteps and leaks have dogged the efforts to contain water, slowing down the decades-long decommissioning process and causing public alarm, while experts have raised concerns that tank failures could lead to an accidental release.  We could have decided much earlier, and that is Tepco's responsibility,  said Kawamura, adding that he would push a government task force overseeing the cleanup to give a clear timetable on when a decision could be made on tritium. Tepco is also under pressure from the central and local governments to decommission all four reactors at Fukushima Daini, 10 kms (6 miles) to the south of the wrecked plant.  One of the sticking points is that it's taking time for an economic check of all plants,  Kawamura said, referring to studies on whether the plants would be economic once the cost of beefing up safety was taken into account. Daini is expected to close given widespread public opposition to nuclear power in the area, but Tepco is aiming to restart the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in the country's west. Kawamura said he would cooperate with a review of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant's safety by the local prefecture, which could delay any restart until at least 2020.

JBS common shares rose as much as 9.7 percent to 7.24 reais, a one-month high, after Brazil's Regional Federal Court of the 1st Region overturned a ruling blocking the $300 million sale of a South American unit to rival Minerva SA .     The ruling  sends a positive signal related to the company's divestment plan,  analysts at UBS Securities wrote in a note to clients, referring to JBS's 6 billion reais ($1.9 billion) asset-sale program.     The transaction could help JBS's controlling shareholder J&F; Investimentos SA pay a massive leniency fine after becoming embroiled in graft probes that have ensnared politicians and executives.     On Wednesday, J&F; agreed to sell a controlling stake in Havaianas flip-flop maker Alpargatas SA to the investment firms of Brazil's most prominent banking families for 3.5 billion reais. Preferred shares in Alpargatas rose 4.2 percent.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.5 percent, but the Brazilian real was nearly flat on investor caution over the political environment.     A congressional committee was set to vote on Thursday on corruption charges against President Michel Temer after its rapporteur recommended the body vote to put him on trial.

Stumpf,USA,FED/YELLEN,WELLS (UPDATE 1),Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Thursday the central bank was prepared to act against directors of Wells Fargo if an investigation deems it appropriate. Under questioning by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about the bank's creation of millions of fake accounts, Yellen said she would not comment on details of the Fed's supervision of Wells Fargo. But  we do have the power to remove directors,  she said.  We need to conduct a thorough investigation to look at the full record ... We are certainly prepared to take enforcement actions.  The company in response noted steps they have taken to date, including election of a new chief executive, appointment of an independent chair and new board members, and a retooling of customer service and sales practices.  Wells Fargo’s board and management team have taken many actions in response to its retail sales practices issues, including changes in senior leadership, executive accountability actions and numerous steps to ensure we make things right,  company spokeswoman Erika Reynoso said in an e-mailed statement.  That work continues.  In June, Warren wrote a letter to the central bank calling for it to remove 12 members of the Wells Fargo Board of Directors. Wells Fargo has been dealing with multiple lawsuits and regulatory inquiries after it created as many as 2.1 million credit card and checking accounts without customer authorization in order to meet aggressive sales targets, the subject of a settlement with regulators on Sept. 8. The ensuing scandal damaged the bank’s reputation as a model for the industry, hammered its shares for several weeks and led to the resignation of CEO and Chairman John Stumpf, who also forfeited tens of millions of dollars worth of compensation. On Sunday, the bank got preliminary approval to pay $142 million, and perhaps more, to customers whose credit scores were harmed by the unauthorized accounts. Still, it faces probes from federal, state and local government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a number of private lawsuits, according to its quarterly securities filing in May. Yellen last fall told lawmakers that the Fed had opened a  broad-based review  of compliance and governance systems at the largest banks, and regarded it as  very important that senior management be held accountable  for any wrongdoing.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-yellen-wells-idUSL1N1K418P"},

The bid by Republican Corey Stewart would pit the blunt-speaking supporter of President Donald Trump against incumbent Senator Tim Kaine, who last year was running mate to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Virginia is a southern state that has turned increasingly Democratic.  I'm going to run the most vicious, ruthless campaign to dethrone Tim Kaine in the United States Senate. It's time that Republicans take back that seat,  Stewart told reporters in Woodbridge, Virginia, a Washington suburb. Stewart, who said he was  Trump before Trump was Trump,  nearly upset former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie in the gubernatorial primary. The result shocked political analysts who had expected Gillespie to win easily. Stewart, the chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, ran on a campaign that featured Confederate flags at rallies, calls for deportation of illegal immigrants and disdain for the Republican establishment. Stewart is the first Republican to declare for the Senate race. Former Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Carly Fiorina and conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham are among those who have said they are weighing possible runs. Virginia Democratic Party Chairwoman Susan Swecker called Stewart a  rubber stamp  for Trump.  We need a senator who will put working and middle-class Virginians first, and that's Tim Kaine,  she said in a statement. Kaine, who is in his first term, is a former Virginia governor and lieutenant governor. This week he said that the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., may have committed treason when he agreed to meet last year with a Russian lawyer who might have damaging information about Clinton. Virginia was once solidly Republican, but the party has not won a statewide race since 2009. The state has gone Democratic in three straight presidential elections. A Quinnipiac University poll in April showed Kaine ahead of Fiorina and Ingraham by double-digit margins. The poll said that 57 percent of Virginia voters disapproved of how Trump was doing his job, versus 36 percent who approved.

A banking source told Reuters that the lenders first wanted to determine Etisalat Nigeria's free cash flow to help them value the telecoms business before deciding on whether to impair the assets or hold on to find new investors.  No bank is talking about restructuring now, but it might get to that later once we are able to ascertain the true value of the company,  the source said. Nigerian regulators intervened last week to save Etisalat Nigeria, the country's fourth-largest mobile operator, from collapse and prevent lenders placing the telecoms firm in receivership, prompting a board and management change. The telecoms firm took-out a $1.2 billion loan four years ago from 13 local lenders to refinance an existing debt and expand its mobile network, but it struggled to repay due a currency crisis and recession in Nigeria. Banks involved in the loan deal include: Zenith Bank , GT Bank, First Bank, UBA , Fidelity Bank, Access Bank, Ecobank, FCMB, Stanbic IBTC Bank and Union Bank. Results are due from this month. GT Bank with $138 million in outstanding loans and Access Bank with $131 million are among the most exposed to Etisalat Nigeria.  We think that by the time the new management settles in, makes some changes and reduces costs, the company might bounce back,  the source told Reuters, adding that he expected support from the central bank, which has sought to avoid Etisalat Nigeria's collapse from sparking a wider debt crisis. Etisalat Nigeria's new chief executive Boye Olusanya told Reuters on Tuesday he was focused on getting the telecoms group back on track to make a profit, while working on the paperwork to eventually raise new capital. Renaissance Capital analysts estimates that Etisalat Nigeria could be worth $1.2 billion based on an enterprise value to operating cashflow multiple when compared with South Africa's MTN and other African telecoms companies. Nigeria's banks are set to report interim earnings this month and investors will be watching for signs of a rise in non-performing loans. The banks collected half of their interest payment for May from Etisalat Nigeria so that the new team running the company has funds to keep it operating, the source said. And any provisioning may not kick in until the next quarter.  Given the understanding that Etisalat's debt was performing till the end of the first quarter we believe the banks ... might be required to make provisions in the second quarter,  said Olalekan Olabode, head of research at Vetiva Capital said.  Rather than converting the debt to equity, we expect to see a restructuring in the near term,  he added.

It would suck up enough water to supply a city and leave a crater a mile and a half wide and 1,000 feet deep. Planned for more than a decade, the project would be a prototype for a looming era of more invasive U.S. mines as companies run out of easy-to-reach deposits, geologists say. It is also the project President Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, had in mind as he began crafting a  hit list  of regulations that should be killed to speed industrial permitting.  A company shouldn't have to be hundreds of millions of dollars into risk money without knowing whether there is a real chance it is going to get approved,  Ross told Reuters in a May 9 interview, referring to the mine. The massive project - which would be among the world's largest copper mines - underscores the dangers of weakening America's rigorous permitting process at a time mining endeavors are becoming increasingly complex and environmentally risky. And Ross's citation of Resolution as a poster child for suffocating regulation reflects how far the Trump administration is willing to go to advance economic growth. Sorting out the mine's potentially negative impacts is anything but simple, and many local residents, along with Native American and environmental groups, say Resolution is exactly the kind of development that cries out for intense public scrutiny - no matter how long it takes.  The companies have to mitigate their risks - mitigate what people are losing,  said Mila Besich-Lira, the mayor of Superior, the town closest to the project. A federal government review of the project has drawn about 130,000 comments from concerned constituents - more than 10 times the number who gave input on the smaller Rosemont Copper Mine nearby. The Resolution mine would also give the region a big economic boost, employing 1,400 people and injecting $20 billion into public coffers, Rio Tinto (RIO.L) estimates. It could supply the United States with a quarter of its copper, putting this small town at the epicenter of the global metals market. Trump has vowed sweep away regulations he says cost America trillions of dollars with no public benefit. The regulatory review by Ross, due for release as soon as this month, is one of several parallel efforts to slash red tape. Trump has also started dismantling Obama-era climate change regulations through executive orders, for example, and directed agencies to kill two rules for every one they create. In the meantime, Congress could set the tone. A Republican bill introduced early this year - and supported by Rio Tinto - would set a two-and-a-half-year deadline on mine permitting, a standard similar to that seen in Australia and Canada.  Deeper, Hotter, Bigger Rio Tinto - along with the Australian mining company BHP Billiton (BLT.L), which owns a 45 percent stake in Resolution - says it has spent 16 years and $1.3 billion on the project, including a decade acquiring acreage in the Tonto National Forest overlying the copper deposit. It is now four years into the federal regulatory review to approve new mines, a process that can take seven to 10 years. Victoria Peacey, a senior manager for environmental permitting at Rio Tinto, said the mine up probably won't begin operating for another decade. Rio Tinto acknowledges the vast scope and sensitivity of its plans.  There are mines this deep; there are mines this hot; and there are mines this big; but there are no other mines this deep, this hot and this big all together,  said Carl Hehnke, a geologist for Resolution. Resolution will take copper from a zone where temperatures run 180 degrees Fahrenheit. With help from remotely controlled machines, miners will set off explosions to shatter sections of the deposit.  The ore will be milled with a combination of sulfuric acid and as much as 6.5 billion gallons of water a year - enough to supply more than half the homes in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. It would eventually render more than 2,400 acres of what is now the Tonto National Forest off limits to visitors.  Roger Featherstone of the Arizona Mine Reform Coalition points to the Resolution Copper mine in the Oak Flat area near Superior, Arizona, June 13, 2017.Nancy WiechecUnder the forest, in a process called  block cave mining,  Rio Tinto will excavate material from underground, making the material above sink and creating the expected one-and-a-half-mile-wide crater.  That area will include a site considered sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which has been holding annual protests against the project. Years of Scrutiny If Resolution's copper deposit had been discovered under private land – and not a national forest – Rio Tinto might have been spared the federal review and faced only state regulators. Instead, the U.S. Forest Service is leading the study, which will consider jobs, recreation, public health and wildlife. Despite its substantial economic benefits to the nearby town of Superior, where many homes and businesses are boarded up, residents still have their concerns.  What am I going to tell my great-grandkids - how this place was totally destroyed?  said Anna Jeffries, a Superior resident, during an April 2016 public meeting with Forest Service officials at Superior High School.  Mining industry lobbyists counter that they are only seeking an efficient and reasonable approval process.

We're talking about bureaucracy.  The NMA wants to see deadlines for permitting, along with rules requiring agencies to conduct studies simultaneously rather than consecutively. The NMA and Rio Tinto back the bill - introduced in January by Republican Congressman Mark Amodei of Nevada - that would give regulators the two-and-a-half year deadline to approve or reject mining projects. Mining companies in Canada and Australia applaud similar time limits in those countries, but a May 2016 report by a government watchdog in the Canadian province of British Columbia found Canada's mine regulation had  major gaps in resources, planning and tools  that led to  inadequate  inspections and  increasing environmental risks.  Commerce Secretary Ross told Reuters in a June 23 phone message he believed the U.S. Forest Service was doing  a good job in terms of Rio Tinto.  But he added,  The rest of the process has been so abysmal that Rio Tinto actually testified before the U.S. Congress [about] how bad the process was.  Ross and his spokesman did not respond to additional questions seeking examples of problems that occurred between Resolution and permit-issuing agencies. But his office said he was referring to Congressional testimony given by Rio Tinto’s Managing Director for Copper and Diamonds, Nigel Steward, in March. Steward called the U.S. permitting process  inefficient  and said it  presents a major barrier to the domestic sector's ability to perform to its full potential.  Rio Tinto is advocating for more certainty in permitting timelines and improved coordination among agencies involved - along with more money for agencies  to ensure that experienced and highly skilled people are devoted to complex technical aspects of permitting,  said Todd Malan, Rio Tinto's vice president for external affairs and communications for the Americas. While the company supports permitting deadlines, at least one Rio Tinto official acknowledges that it would be hard to address the issues raised by the Resolution mine in less than years.  I'm not necessarily saying time frames would not be helpful, but three years? ... That's a tight time frame,  said Peacey. While uncertain permitting timeframes raise financial risks for Rio Tinto, she said, the sometimes lengthy process also protects the public.  Those are people's rights,  she said.

The Briton, who will be chasing a fourth successive home win at Silverstone on Sunday, was the only driver to miss the F1 Live event on Wednesday. Instead, the triple world champion was holidaying with friends in Greece.  It's been a pretty intense season so far and I felt I needed to prepare the best way I could for this weekend,  the Mercedes driver, who faced a barrage of questions about his absence and the disappointment of fans, told reporters on Thursday.  The season's the most important thing for me. That's really it,  added Hamilton, who said he was unaware of any negative reaction from fans, some of whom had booed his name on Wednesday.  I love this grand prix. I don't think yesterday plays any role in how great this weekend is for me,  added Hamilton, who said he told event organizers last week that he would not be attending. Hamilton can join the late Jim Clark as the only five times winner of the British Grand Prix and he left no doubt about how important the race was for him regardless of the championship standings. The 32-year-old is 20 points behind Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel after nine of 20 races and comes back to Silverstone after being off the podium for two races in a row -- the first time that has happened since 2014. He said he was relaxed and excited for the weekend.  You've got the championship, which is obviously the most important thing, and a very close second if not tied is the British Grand Prix,  he declared.  Being a home grand prix, the home of motorsport, it's such an incredible intense weekend, every year it's a must-win for a British driver.  Hamilton dismissed a suggestion that his absence on Wednesday had something to do with image rights and also gave short shrift to a suggestion that staying in Britain might have been better preparation than hours of flying. He also shrugged off a question about Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff reportedly attending Vettel's birthday party ahead of a hearing into the German driving into Hamilton's car in Azerbaijan.  All I can do is laugh at that one,  he replied.  It might be the dumbest question I've had so far.

Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhebane said last month her investigation had found the apartheid government and central bank breached the constitution by supplying a bank later acquired by Absa, the retail banking unit of Barclays Africa, with a series of bailouts from 1986 to 1995. The constitutionally mandated anti-corruption agency said Absa must repay 1.1 billion rand ($83 million) to the state.  In reaching her finding that Absa benefited from the South African Reserve Bank financial support, the Public Protector appears to have impermissibly ignored facts and disregarded evidence provided to her,  Absa said. The bank said in court filings it had not benefited from the central bank bailout of Bankorp because the price it paid for it took into account the central bank's financial assistance.  The Public Protector does not justify her conclusion for finding that ABSA is liable to repay 1.125 billion rand in her report or in her subsequent explanations of her report,  Absa said in court filings  It added the real beneficiaries of the bailout were Bankorp shareholders, the majority of whom were life insurance company Sanlam's policy holders.     Absa also said the Public Protector was unfair in how she came to her findings because she  refused to provide Absa with documents upon which she relied to make her findings.  The bank also argued she had no jurisdiction over events that took place before her office was established in October 1995.    The central bank is also challenging the protector's findings in court, as well as her proposal to have the mandate of the Reserve Bank changed to focus on economic growth instead of price and currency stability. That proposal, also opposed in court by finance minister Malusi Gigaba, set off a political row and sparked a sell-off in the rand currency and government bonds.

KEY RATING DRIVERS Robust Performance The affirmation reflects the sound performance of the underlying assets. Arrears remain limited in both transactions, with the portion of loans in arrears by more than three months at 1.1% for Domos 2011-A and 0.3% for Domos B of the current portfolio balance. According to the investor report as at April 2017 for Domos 2011-A and May 2017 for Domos 2011-B, cumulative defaults have built up to 2.5% (Domos 2011-A) of the initial pool balance and 1.5% (Domos 2011-B) of the pool balance after the tap issuance in July 2015. Both transactions define defaults as loans in arrears by more than 10 months, or those declared due and payable by the servicer. Accelerated Waterfall Triggered Given the lack of excess spread, caused by a sudden influx of defaults in February 2017 and a lower portfolio yield, as a result of prepayments, the three-months compartment solvency margin trigger in Domos A led to a switch to an accelerated priority of payments in March 2017. Since then, the class A1 and A2 notes have been redeeming on a pro rata basis. Note payments are now made on a monthly basis and all the principal and interest amounts received from the portfolio are used to redeem both class A notes. The reserve fund, which was sized at 8.5% of the notes' balance at the restructuring date in July 2015, has been partially released in the priority of payment to reimburse the senior notes; as at April 2017, it stood at 1.0% of the notes' balance. High Credit Enhancement The amortisation of the portfolios has led to a significant increase in the credit enhancement in both transactions. After the release of a portion of the general reserve and the accelerated waterfall, Domos A's class A1 and A2 credit enhancement has built-up to 79.8%, compared to 59.8% 12 months ago. The reserve fund now represents 1% of the current notes' balance and can only be used for liquidity. Domos B features a non-amortising reserve fund that is currently at its target level (4.5% of the initial notes' balance at the date of the restructuring in July 2015). The reserve fund includes an amount equivalent to 1% of the current note balance that is only available for liquidity. The credit enhancement provided by the reserve fund has built up to 6.8% for Domos 2011-B. Moreover, the subordination of the unrated class B notes provides an additional cushion. As at May 2017, the class A credit enhancement stood at 34.0%, compared with 27.0% as of May 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES A deterioration in asset performance may result from economic factors, in particular the increasing effect of unemployment. A corresponding increase in new defaults and associated pressure on excess spread levels and the reserve fund could result in negative rating action. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has received about the performance of the asset pools and the transactions. There were no findings that were material to this analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the results of any third-party assessment of the asset portfolio information or conducted a review of the origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring. Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch reviewed the results of a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, which indicated no adverse findings material to the rating analysis. Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted sample of BNPP PF's origination files and found inconsistencies related to the property value information, which can include agency or notary fees. These findings were considered in this analysis by assuming a 9% haircut to the property value. Overall and together with the assumptions referred to above, Fitch's assessment of the information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.

Under questioning by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about the bank's creation of millions of fake accounts, Yellen said she would not comment on details of the Fed's supervision of Wells Fargo (WFC.N). But  we do have the power to remove directors,  she said.  We need to conduct a thorough investigation to look at the full record ... We are certainly prepared to take enforcement actions.  The company in response noted steps they have taken to date, including election of a new chief executive, appointment of an independent chair and new board members, and a retooling of customer service and sales practices.      Wells Fargo’s board and management team have taken many actions in response to its retail sales practices issues, including changes in senior leadership, executive accountability actions and numerous steps to ensure we make things right,  company spokeswoman Erika Reynoso said in an e-mailed statement.  That work continues.  In June, Warren wrote a letter to the central bank calling for it to remove 12 members of the Wells Fargo Board of Directors. Wells Fargo has been dealing with multiple lawsuits and regulatory inquiries after it created as many as 2.1 million credit card and checking accounts without customer authorization in order to meet aggressive sales targets, the subject of a settlement with regulators on Sept. 8. The ensuing scandal damaged the bank’s reputation as a model for the industry, hammered its shares for several weeks and led to the resignation of CEO and Chairman John Stumpf, who also forfeited tens of millions of dollars worth of compensation. On Sunday, the bank got preliminary approval to pay $142 million, and perhaps more, to customers whose credit scores were harmed by the unauthorized accounts. Still, it faces probes from federal, state and local government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a number of private lawsuits, according to its quarterly securities filing in May. Yellen last fall told lawmakers that the Fed had opened a  broad-based review  of compliance and governance systems at the largest banks, and regarded it as  very important that senior management be held accountable  for any wrongdoing.

Maria Baptista and Elita Zacarias  are linked to the ex-Minister Haiman El Troudi and must appear July 27,  the state prosecutor's office said on Twitter, without providing further details. El Troudi later said that his relatives, whom local media have reported are his wife and mother-in-law, had nothing to do with the case.   To get to me, Mrs. Prosecutor, my immunity is no obstacle and my family shouldn't be the way forward,  he tweeted.  As this case is chiefly political, know that I will be the one to present myself to the prosecutor's office, with my conscience clear and my head high.  Reuters was unable to obtain comments from Baptista and Zacarias. Odebrecht, the largest engineering and construction company in Latin America, acknowledged in 2016 that it paid some $98 million dollars in bribes over several years to obtain contracts in Venezuela. Earlier this year, the prosecutors sought the arrest of Odebrecht Venezuela chief Euzenando Azevedo, but he has not yet been captured and is presumed to have already left the country. President Nicolas Maduro has publicly said that those responsible for the embezzlement must be punished.  But the investigation has moved particularly slowly through the justice system, in contrast to other countries in the region where similar bribery took place. Odebrecht has left at least 23 multi-million dollar projects unfinished or stalled in Venezuela, according to company and government documents, interviews with over two dozen workers, and site visits. Still, a political showdown between the government and the prosecutor might be hastening investigations.  Prosecutor Luisa Ortega is clashing with the leftist government, and her office appears to have sped up accusations of high-profile Socialist Party officials, security officials, and oil executives in the last month. But the pro-government Supreme Court later on Wednesday issued a decision curtailing the prosecutor's powers to indict people. Ortega has also said she expects to be fired after accusing Maduro's government of human rights violations and erosion of democracy. She has said she would resist such a move.

Most of what the pair announced went over old ground, but the plans to develop Europe's next generation of fighter planes together could shape the future of the European fighter industry and its three existing programs - Eurofighter, France's Rafale and Sweden's Gripen. It also comes as Britain's decision to leave the European Union changes the balance of interests for a country that is both a key defense industry player and a military power. France and Germany said their new combat system, which analysts say could involve a mixture of manned and unmanned aircraft, would replace both the Rafale and the Eurofighter. That marks the end of a decades-long split which saw France withdraw from the Eurofighter project in the 1980s to produce its own Rafale warplane under Dassault Aviation. The two aircraft compete fiercely for global sales. Related CoverageFrance and Germany to develop new European fighter jet It is a sign to the British. It means 'you are leaving the EU and we are driving forward. We are no longer interested in you blocking the EU on defense',  a senior German defense industry official told Reuters. The deal could push Britain further towards co-operation with the United States where London-listed BAE Systems, also part of the Eurofighter program, helps Lockheed Martin make the F-35.  Euro Zone Focus  Tighter cooperation in the euro zone currency bloc was also flagged by the leaders - continuing a theme running through the core members of the European Union since Britain's vote to leave shook its foundations just over a year ago. French President Emmanuel Macron (R Rear) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L Rear), stand as from L-R, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian, European Commission Vice-President and EU Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, and German Minister of State for Europe at the Federal Foreign Office Michael Roth sign documents during the launch of the “Alliance for Sahel” at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, July 13, 2017.Patrick Kovarik/Pool We agreed we must stabilize the euro zone and develop it further, that a standstill is always close to going backwards so we need some dynamism,  Merkel said. Concrete steps in the direction of tax harmonization would, however, be required to make real progress on that integration, and neither leader gave any real details on progress. France and Germany have long pushed for convergence in the way taxes are calculated in the euro zone, but have made little progress even agreeing among each other. Slideshow (7 Images)German business newspaper Handelsblatt nevertheless said finance ministers from both countries would present a roadmap by mid-September on the subject. The plan would be finalised by December and could then be adopted next year, Handelsblatt added, citing sources involved in the negotiations. Going beyond taxes, broader economic convergence in the euro zone could prove tricky. Macron told regional daily L'Ouest France that changes to the EU's governing treaties were needed, a process that has in the past proved a tortuous endeavor. The emergence of big internet companies that reduce their tax bills by domiciling their EU tax bases in countries with the lowest rates has also given a new impetus to efforts to harmonize taxation. A French court struck down on Wednesday the tax administration's demand for Google to pay backtaxes worth 1.1 billion euros, ruling that Google Ireland Limited was not subject to corporate and value-added taxes for the period under consideration, from 2005-2010. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday that the European Union had to ensure big U.S. internet companies such as Google paid their share of taxes. Among other measures set out by the meeting was a broad-based EU plan for the digital industry aimed at tackling tax avoidance by the industry's big players and organizing finance for start-ups and cyber security to be prepared for the EU digital summit taking place at the end of September.

The Viability Rating (VR) has been downgraded to 'bb-' from 'bb' and placed on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary The downgrade of the VR reflects deterioration in the bank's asset quality and high exposure to problem financing, highlighting weaknesses in underwriting standards. Capital ratios are declining and considered weak in light of the bank's high financing book concentration and asset quality problems. Capital generation is also constrained by high non-financing expenses and impairment charges. There has been high management turnover and while the newly-appointed management has relevant experience to run the bank and is actively addressing key shortfalls, it will take some time for the bank's strategy to be fully implemented and yield results. The RWN on AHB's VR reflects the potential for further downgrade if the bank fails to implement its restructuring plan, reduce its problem financing ratio, cut its cost base and raise sufficient core capital in 2H17. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SR, SRF AND DEBT AHB's IDRs, SR and SRF are driven by an extremely high probability of support from the UAE and Abu Dhabi authorities if needed. This considers the bank's significant Abu Dhabi government ownership, which offsets its lower systemic importance in the UAE. Fitch's view of support factors in the sovereign's strong capacity to support the banking system, sustained by sovereign wealth funds and on-going revenues mostly from hydrocarbon production, despite lower oil prices, and the moderate size of the UAE banking sector relative to the country's GDP. Fitch also expects high willingness from the authorities to support the banking sector, which has been demonstrated by the UAE authorities' long track record of supporting domestic banks, as well as close ties and part government ownership links of a number of banks. AHB's SRF is at Abu Dhabi banks' SRF for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIB) of 'A+. Abu Dhabi banks' D-SIB SRF is one notch higher than other UAE banks, due to Abu Dhabi's superior financial flexibility. The sukuk issued under AHB's sukuk vehicle (AHB Sukuk Company Ltd) are rated in line with the bank's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same rating drivers. VR AHB's VR reflects the bank's weak asset quality and profitability, high financing book concentration, low capital ratios and small domestic franchise. The VR also factors in AHB's adequate funding and liquidity. AHB's asset quality metrics deteriorated in 2014 and further in 2015 with the impairment of two of its largest exposures. The impaired financing ratio (NPF) was 8.4% at end-2016, higher than the average of rated UAE peers. The bank's asset quality has deteriorated further in 2017 with a sharp increase in the more than 90 days past due, resulting in a high total problem financing ratio above peers. The financing book is highly concentrated, with the 20 largest exposures representing 3.4x the bank's Fitch Core Capital (FCC) at end-2016, higher than UAE peers. AHB's profitability is weaker than peers, impacted by high impairment charges, a high cost base and low fee income generation constrained by its relatively undiversified business model. The cost to income ratio (64% in 2016) is significantly above peers. The bank is targeting a reduction in its cost to income ratio in 2017, but Fitch believes this might be difficult to attain without the bank improving its revenue generation. Impairment charges absorbed 75% of the bank's pre-impairment operating profit in 2016, resulting in 3.4% return on equity, strongly below its peers' average. AHB's capitalisation is weak, especially in light of its asset quality deterioration and high financing book concentration. Capital ratios have been on a declining trend since 2014, impacted by high impairment charges. The FCC ratio dropped to 9.5% at end-2016 below UAE peers average. The Tier 1 capital ratio was higher at 14.6% at end-2016, supported by a AED1.8 billion Tier 1 sukuk issuance. Fitch believes AHB's capitalisation will come under further pressure if it fails to raise sufficient core capital to boost its capital ratios. AHB has adequate liquidity with liquid assets including cash balances, interbank placements and investment securities maturing within a year covering 18% of total deposits at end-2016. The financing to deposit ratio increased to 108% at end-2016 due to 7% growth in the financing book. We expect the ratio to drop as the bank is not planning on financing book growth in 2017. The deposit base is more concentrated than peers, given the bank's small domestic franchise. The 20 largest depositors accounted for a significant portion of the total deposit base at end-2016 and were largely related to the Abu Dhabi government and its GREs given the bank's ownership and its close ties to the government. The bank's strategy focuses on conservative underwriting standards, steady balance sheet growth, deleveraging and capital ratios preservation, higher liquidity, further diversification of the funding base, and reducing the cost base. In assessing AHB's ratings, we considered important differences between Islamic and conventional banks. These factors include closer analysis of regulatory oversight, disclosure, accounting standards and corporate governance. Islamic banks' ratings do not express an opinion on the bank's compliance with sharia. Fitch will assess non-compliance with sharia if it has credit implications. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SR, SRF AND DEBT AHB's IDRs, SR and SRF are sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of the UAE and Abu Dhabi authorities and on their propensity to support the banking system or the bank. The sukuk issued under AHB's sukuk vehicle (AHB Sukuk Company Ltd) is subject to the same sensitivities as the bank's IDR. VR Resolution of the RWN will depend on the bank's success in improving its asset quality ratios (possibly through the settlement of some large impaired financing), raising sufficient core capital to increase its capital ratios significantly, reducing its high cost base, and starting restructuring as part of the bank's strategy. Following the resolution of the RWN, AHB's VR will remain sensitive to further deterioration in asset quality, capitalisation and profitability. Upside is currently limited unless there is a solid track record of improvement in its asset quality metrics and a reduction in its financing concentration. The rating actions are as follows: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'A+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F1' VR downgraded to 'bb-' from 'bb'; placed on RWN Support Rating affirmed at '1' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'A+' AHB Sukuk Company Limited: Trust certificate issuance programme affirmed at 'A+'/'F1' Senior unsecured certificates affirmed at 'A+' CRITERIA VARIATION: Under Fitch's Global Bank Rating Criteria, Fitch's SRFs are based on the ability and propensity of the government to provide support. Within the UAE, Fitch assesses the potential for support at federal level as Fitch believes that support would be forthcoming from the UAE authorities acting together. However, in respect of Abu Dhabi, Fitch has varied the criteria to reflect the superior financial flexibility of the Abu Dhabi authorities. As such, the SRFs for banks in Abu Dhabi are based on Fitch's assessment of the ability and propensity of the Abu Dhabi authorities to provide support in its own right. This results in a one notch higher SRF for Abu Dhabi banks (compared with other UAE banks), and results in a one notch higher rating for the bank.

Those living in  absolute poverty  rose to 4.74 million last year, or 7.9 percent of the population, up from 7.6 percent in 2015 and the highest since current records began in 2005, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported. ISTAT defines absolute poverty as the condition of those who are unable to buy goods and services  essential to avoid grave forms of social exclusion . Italy emerged from a long recession in 2014, but the report shows that the slow growth posted since then has done little to help the poorest sectors of society. Gross domestic product is forecast to rise by around 1.1 percent this year, up from 0.9 percent in 2016, but leaving Italy in its customary position among the euro zone's most sluggish economies. The country faces elections next spring, and opposition parties were quick to blame the PD and its leader, Matteo Renzi, for the record poverty levels.  When a government is unable to provide for people's basic needs, we can undoubtedly say it has failed,  said Giovanni Barozzino, a senator for the Italian Left party, which split from the PD in 2015, complaining Renzi had dragged it to the right. In the underdeveloped south of Italy, 9.8 percent of people were living in absolute poverty, compared with 7.3 in central regions including the capital Rome, and 6.7 percent in the wealthier north, including the business capital Milan. ISTAT said Italians living in  relative poverty,  or those whose disposable income is less than around half the national average, also edged up in 2016 to 8.5 million people, or 14.0 percent of the population.  That compared with 13.7 percent in 2015 and was the highest since current records began in 1997.

U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued nine citations, several of which echo previous cautions by federal agencies at two other Exxon plants. The citations, issued in May, were seen by Reuters this month. A separate investigation by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) is ongoing and its report on the incident is due by year-end. Exxon said it is contesting the OSHA citations and fines. The facility was faulted five years ago by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for failing to address corrosion on pipes and valves and for inadequate shutdown and emergency procedures provided to workers. The Nov. 22, 2016 explosion on a sulfuric-acid alkylation unit that makes octane-boosting components of gasoline in the sprawling Baton Rouge refinery and chemical plant injured four workers, two of them severely. Two of the affected workers declined to comment; others could not be reached. A worker on the alkylation unit removed the cover of a malfunctioning valve on an isobutane line and used a wrench to turn the value stem, Exxon reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality in a letter. Volatile isobutane is converted in the alkylation unit to a component of gasoline. As the operator turned the valve stem, portions of the valve fell out, releasing isobutane, according to the Exxon letter, which was ignited by a welding machine 70 feet away. One worker was knocked off a scaffold next to the alkylation unit and left dangling over the fire, according to two sources. Another worker was burned over most of her body. Exxon's safety procedures and training for operators on the alkylation unit were lacking, equipment was not properly maintained, and required inspections were not carried out within required time periods, according to a copy of the citations seen by Reuters.  We cooperated with OSHA's investigation and shared extensive information and records,  said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker.  We are contesting the citations and associated penalty.  Huffaker said  nothing is more important  to Exxon than maintaining a safe workplace for workers and residents near its facilities. Eight of the nine citations were listed as serious, each carrying a fine of $12,675. The ninth, for failing to carry out external visual and ultrasonic inspections of piping, carries a fine of $63,373. The later fine was higher because Exxon was cited in 2016 for violating the same inspection standard at a Baytown, Texas, refining and chemical plant complex, OSHA said in the citation. In a report issued in May after a two-year investigation of a 2015 explosion at an 86-year-old Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon, the CSB said the company lacked a procedure for operating a fluidic catalytic cracking unit in an idled mode, as was being done when the explosion took place. Exxon sold the Torrance refinery to PBF Energy Inc in July 2016. In 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inspected the Baton Rouge refinery as part of a risk management prevention program and found Exxon had not examined in five years more than 1,000 underground pipes, many of which the EPA said were corroded, according to the agency's report on the inspection. The EPA also said emergency and shutdown procedures failed to provide needed details for operators. Huffaker said in an email that Exxon contested the violations, and said the EPA withdrew all but two of its findings. She did not respond to a request for details.

Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhebane said last month her investigation had found the apartheid government and central bank breached the constitution by supplying a bank later acquired by Absa, the retail banking unit of Barclays Africa, with a series of bailouts from 1986 to 1995. The constitutionally mandated anti-corruption agency said Absa must repay 1.1 billion rand ($83 million) to the state.  In reaching her finding that Absa benefited from the South African Reserve Bank financial support, the Public Protector appears to have impermissibly ignored facts and disregarded evidence provided to her,  Absa said. The bank said in court filings it had not benefited from the central bank bailout of Bankorp because the price it paid for it took into account the central bank's financial assistance.  The Public Protector does not justify her conclusion for finding that ABSA is liable to repay 1.125 billion rand in her report or in her subsequent explanations of her report,  Absa said in court filings  It added the real beneficiaries of the bailout were Bankorp shareholders, the majority of whom were life insurance company Sanlam's policy holders.     Absa also said the Public Protector was unfair in how she came to her findings because she  refused to provide Absa with documents upon which she relied to make her findings.  The bank also argued she had no jurisdiction over events that took place before her office was established in October 1995.    The central bank is also challenging the protector's findings in court, as well as her proposal to have the mandate of the Reserve Bank changed to focus on economic growth instead of price and currency stability. That proposal, also opposed in court by finance minister Malusi Gigaba, set off a political row and sparked a sell-off in the rand currency and government bonds.

The move to develop a new warplane accelerates steps that are expected to shape the future of the European fighter industry and its three existing programs - the Eurofighter, France's Rafale and Sweden's Gripen. The move also reflects efforts to give fresh impetus to Franco-German relations in the aftermath of Britain's decision to leave the European Union and was described by defense experts as a snub to Europe's leading military power.. France and Germany aim to come up with a roadmap by mid 2018 for jointly leading development of the new aircraft to replace their existing fleets of rival warplanes, according to a document issued after a Franco-German cabinet meeting in Paris.  Today there are too many European standards and qualifications and sometimes there is competition among Europeans internationally,  French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference, flanked by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  I can confirm this is a deep revolution but we are not afraid when they are carried out peacefully, in a structured way and over time,  Macron said. France and Germany said their new combat system, which analysts say could involve a mixture of manned and unmanned aircraft, would replace the Rafale and Eurofighter, rival jets that compete fiercely for global sales. That would mark the end of a decades-long split since France withdrew from the Eurofighter project in the 1980s to produce its Rafale warplane with Dassault Aviation. Defense industry experts called the move a setback to Britain and its leading arms contractor, BAE Systems.  It is a sign to the British. It means 'you are leaving the EU and we are driving forward. We are no longer interested in you blocking the EU on defense',  a senior German defense industry official told Reuters. French President Emmanuel Macron arrives with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to attend a Franco-German joint cabinet meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, July 13, 2017.Stephane MaheBritain Out on a Limb? The joint declaration did not say what role, if any, Britain would play in the Franco-German-led development. The country is Europe's biggest defense spender and a partner in the Eurofighter project alongside Germany, Spain and Italy. France and the United Kingdom - both permanent U.N. Security Council members with close defense and security ties - agreed to cooperate on nuclear and missiles technology in 2010, but some French officials have expressed concerns about the impact of Brexit on defense. Some analysts and defense officials said the Franco-German push to create a new fighter could drive Britain further toward industrial and defense cooperation with the United States. Currently, Britain has a foot in both camps through the Lockheed Martin F-35 and a share of the Eurofighter program through BAE.  It is almost inevitable that the UK would consider a new partnership with America for the next generation of fighters,  said Alexandra Ashbourne-Walmsley, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank based in London.  The UK has accepted that it can't build another fighter on its own, both as a natural evolution from the F-35 program and also because of economies of scale since having a small part of a U.S. project is worth more than a Franco-German program.  However, Thursday's declaration is also seen by some as just the opening move in a long and unpredictable European negotiation affecting defense firms including BAE and its Eurofighter partners Airbus and Leonardo. Paris and Berlin also agreed to set up a cooperation framework for the next model of the Airbus Tiger attack helicopter and for tactical air-to-ground missiles.  In addition, they will work together on procuring ground systems including heavy tanks and artillery and said a contract was expected to be signed before 2019 for the military  Eurodrone  project, which also includes Italy.

Speaking after a joint meeting of their cabinet ministers in Paris, the first since this year's French presidential and parliamentary elections, Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron also flagged their aim to harmonize taxes within the EU and develop a coherent digital strategy for the bloc.  I believe that we have shown shortly after the new government here was installed that we are ready to activate Franco-German relations with a new impetus,  Merkel told reporters at a joint news conference. Most of what the pair announced went over old ground, but the plans to develop Europe's next generation of fighter planes together could shape the future of the European fighter industry and its three existing programs - Eurofighter, France's Rafale and Sweden's Gripen. It also comes as Britain's decision to leave the European Union changes the balance of interests for a country that is both a key defense industry player and a military power. France and Germany said their new combat system, which analysts say could involve a mixture of manned and unmanned aircraft, would replace both the Rafale and the Eurofighter. That marks the end of a decades-long split which saw France withdraw from the Eurofighter project in the 1980s to produce its own Rafale warplane under Dassault Aviation. The two aircraft compete fiercely for global sales. Related CoverageFrance and Germany to develop new European fighter jet It is a sign to the British. It means 'you are leaving the EU and we are driving forward. We are no longer interested in you blocking the EU on defense',  a senior German defense industry official told Reuters. The deal could push Britain further towards co-operation with the United States where London-listed BAE Systems, also part of the Eurofighter program, helps Lockheed Martin make the F-35.  Euro Zone Focus  Tighter cooperation in the euro zone currency bloc was also flagged by the leaders - continuing a theme running through the core members of the European Union since Britain's vote to leave shook its foundations just over a year ago. French President Emmanuel Macron (R Rear) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L Rear), stand as from L-R, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian, European Commission Vice-President and EU Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, and German Minister of State for Europe at the Federal Foreign Office Michael Roth sign documents during the launch of the “Alliance for Sahel” at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, July 13, 2017.Patrick Kovarik/Pool We agreed we must stabilize the euro zone and develop it further, that a standstill is always close to going backwards so we need some dynamism,  Merkel said. Concrete steps in the direction of tax harmonization would, however, be required to make real progress on that integration, and neither leader gave any real details on progress. France and Germany have long pushed for convergence in the way taxes are calculated in the euro zone, but have made little progress even agreeing among each other. Slideshow (7 Images)German business newspaper Handelsblatt nevertheless said finance ministers from both countries would present a roadmap by mid-September on the subject. The plan would be finalised by December and could then be adopted next year, Handelsblatt added, citing sources involved in the negotiations. Going beyond taxes, broader economic convergence in the euro zone could prove tricky. Macron told regional daily L'Ouest France that changes to the EU's governing treaties were needed, a process that has in the past proved a tortuous endeavor. The emergence of big internet companies that reduce their tax bills by domiciling their EU tax bases in countries with the lowest rates has also given a new impetus to efforts to harmonize taxation. A French court struck down on Wednesday the tax administration's demand for Google to pay backtaxes worth 1.1 billion euros, ruling that Google Ireland Limited was not subject to corporate and value-added taxes for the period under consideration, from 2005-2010. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday that the European Union had to ensure big U.S. internet companies such as Google paid their share of taxes. Among other measures set out by the meeting was a broad-based EU plan for the digital industry aimed at tackling tax avoidance by the industry's big players and organizing finance for start-ups and cyber security to be prepared for the EU digital summit taking place at the end of September.

A rise in shares of Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet provided the biggest boost to the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Global equity markets rallied after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled a more gradual tightening of monetary policy than expected on Wednesday. The U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, though low inflation and a low neutral rate may leave the central bank with diminished leeway, Yellen said. Yellen wrapped up her two-day testimony before Congress on Thursday and said it would be  quite challenging  for the U.S. to reach the three percent growth target set by President Donald Trump.  Yesterday's move was in response to Yellen comments that should inflation remain below the 2 percent target rate, the central bank will be less aggressive in their tightening program,  said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.  Today, the market is saying that's old news and let's focus on the matter at hand, which is earnings that will be coming out in earnest this week.  Quarterly earnings will kick off on Friday with big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup reporting results. The financial index was the second-largest gainer among the 11 major S&P; sectors, rising 0.47 percent. Second quarter earnings are expected to increase 7.8 percent from a year ago, after first-quarter earnings posted their best performance since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 12:48 p.m. ET (1648 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 26.5 points, or 0.12 percent, at 21,558.64, the S&P; 500 was up 4.84 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,448.09. The Nasdaq Composite was up 13.26 points, or 0.21 percent, at 6,274.43. Data showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly rose in June. In the 12 months through June the producer level inflation, or PPI, increased 2.0 percent, above the 1.9 percent rise expected. Another set of data showed weekly jobless claims fell last week for the first time in a month. Among stocks, Target rose 4.5 percent after the retailer gave an upbeat second-quarter forecast. The news boosted other retailers, with Wal-Mart up 1.4 percent and Costco edging up 0.8 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,462 to 1,364. On the Nasdaq, 1,721 issues fell and 1,046 advanced.

The Viability Rating (VR) has also been affirmed at 'bb-'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SR AND DEBT EI's IDRs and SR reflect Fitch's view that EI is a key and integral subsidiary of its 99.9% shareholder, Emirates NBD (ENBD; A+/Stable/F1). ENBD's IDRs are based on potential support available from the UAE and Dubai authorities, if need be. In Fitch's view, this support would flow through to EI given EI's role and track record in the group (offering retail, SME and small corporate Islamic finance services for the group), the very high reputational risk to ENBD of an EI default, as well as the Central Bank of United Arab Emirates' (CBUAE) inclination to favour support as EI operates in the same home market as ENBD. The three Sukuk issued by EI Sukuk Company Limited (100% owned subsidiary) are rated in line with the bank's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same rating drivers. VR EI's VR reflects the bank's high impaired financing ratio, moderate capital ratios, variable profitability, acceptable management and strategy, and adequate funding and liquidity profile. EI's VR has been constrained by the bank's weak asset quality. EI's asset quality metrics have continued to show modest deterioration. The impaired financing ratio increased to 9.1% at end-2016 (8.8% at end-2015) with reserve coverage improving over the same period increasing to 97% from 90%, due to additional reserving requirements under IFRS 9. EI has a relatively diversified balance sheet through its focus on retail and SME financing. However, the financing book remains concentrated on single-name exposures (the top 20 exposures represented 1.1x of total equity at end-2016). EI's capital ratios (the Fitch Core Capital ratio was about 15% at end-2016) are now more in line with other Fitch-rated UAE banks. Improvement in EI's capital ratios during 2016 can be attributed to the parent's capital injection of AED1.5 billion via a rights issue, which is the second equally sized rights issue to take place in the last four years. At end-2016, the Tier 1 regulatory ratio was 14.9%. The total regulatory capital ratio was 16.1%. If capital above the minimum regulatory requirement is added to loss reserves, then the loss reserve/gross financing ratio increases to 13.3% from 8.8%, giving a moderate capital buffer. Earnings and profitability metrics have been variable and track below peers. Fitch's key earnings and profitability metric, operating profit/ risk weighted assets, demonstrates the variability of the bank's operating profitability, ranging from 0.2% to 1.5% over the last four years. Over the same period, UAE peers have demonstrated on average a stable 2.2% operating profit/ risk weighted assets. A combination of large financing impairment charges relative to operating profit, and an above average (but improving) cost to income ratio explains why EI's overall profitability has been and is likely to remain below the industry average. EI is largely funded by stable customer deposits, which accounted for about 82% of total non-equity funding at end-2016. The deposit base is less concentrated than peers due to its retail focus providing a stable funding base for the short to medium term. EI has complemented its deposit funding with three Sukuk issues, demonstrating good access to capital markets when required. EI has a large stock of liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents, short term interbank placement and liquid securities) equivalent to 40% of deposits, providing an adequate liquidity cushion. EI's financing to deposits ratio is in line with peers. In assessing EI's ratings, we considered important differences between Islamic and conventional banks. These factors include closer analysis of regulatory oversight, disclosure, accounting standards and corporate governance. Islamic banks' ratings do not express an opinion on the bank's compliance with sharia. Fitch will assess non-compliance with sharia if it has credit implications. RATING SENSITIVITIES- IDRs, SR AND SUKUK EI's IDRs and SR are sensitive to a change in ENBD's IDRs. Unless its importance to ENBD diminishes, EI's IDRs will remain equalised with ENBD's. As such, the Stable Outlook on EI's Long-Term IDR mirrors that on ENBD. In turn, ENBD's IDRs are sensitive to a change in the UAE and Dubai authorities' ability or propensity to provide support. The three Sukuks issued via EI Sukuk Company Limited are rated in line with EI's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same sensitivities. VR The upside for the VR could arise from improvements in the underlying asset quality and capital ratios. Further evidence of EI implementing its strategy and growing its financing book with no material deterioration in the bank's risk indicators would also contribute to an upgrade.

Today, I join those in China and around the world in mourning the tragic passing of 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died while serving a lengthy prison sentence in China for promoting peaceful democratic reform,  Tillerson said in a statement.  I call on the Chinese government to release Liu Xia from house arrest and allow her to depart China, according to her wishes.  Liu Xiaobo, a prominent dissident since the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, died on Thursday after being denied permission to leave the country for treatment of late-stage liver cancer. U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi echoed Tillerson's call for Liu Xia's freedom and described her husband as  one of the great moral voices of our time.  She said his treatment was  a sobering reminder of China’s shameful disregard for basic freedoms.  Republican Senator Tom Cotton said Liu Xiaobo has shown  a quiet but formidable courage that will live on in the hearts of all Chinese people who long to be free.”  To deprive a man of treatment and watch him die a slow, painful death is an outrage against humanity. But the Communist regime was so cruel toward Liu Xiaobo because its leaders knew, in their hearts, the power of his message,  he said.

The Viability Rating (VR) has also been affirmed at 'b+'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs, SENIOR DEBT, SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Noor's IDRs, SR and SRF reflect the extremely high probability of state support available to the bank from the UAE and Dubai authorities if needed. This considers its significant government and ruling family ownership, which partially offsets its lower systemic importance in the UAE. Fitch's view of support factors in the sovereign's strong capacity to support the banking system, sustained by sovereign wealth funds and on-going revenues mostly from hydrocarbon production, despite lower oil prices, and the moderate size of the UAE banking sector relative to the country's GDP. Fitch also expects high willingness from the authorities to support the banking sector, which has been demonstrated by the UAE authorities' long track record of supporting domestic banks, as well as close ties and part government ownership links of a number of banks. Noor's SRF is one notch below the UAE Domestic Systemically Important Banks' (D-SIB) SRF of 'A'. This is due to Fitch's view that Noor is less systemically important based on its 2% market share of total UAE banking system assets and its small domestic franchise. The sukuk issuances under Noor Sukuk Ltd are rated in line with the bank's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same rating drivers. VR Noor's VR reflects its small but growing franchise, limited track record in implementing its strategy, weak but improving asset quality, high concentration in the financing book, and in this respect low capital levels. The VR also takes into account Noor's adequate liquidity, growing and more diversified customer base, improving profitability and diversified income stream. Noor's VR is constrained by its small but growing franchise as it is still a relatively young bank. Noor grew quickly in Dubai GREs financing, which resulted in weak asset quality and high financing book concentration. The bank is reducing its concentration to GREs as it is moving to a more sustainable balanced franchise and business model. Since the crisis Noor has been diversifying from this type of financing and increasing its focus on retail, trade and growing its fees business. However, it still has a limited track record of implementing its strategy. Noor began its business operations around the start of the financial crisis. The bank's Dubai focus and high exposure to Dubai GREs increased its exposure to problem financing, which has been improving with the recovery of the operating environment. The impaired financing ratio reached 33% at end-2011 and had declined to 5% at end-2016 due to repayments, write offs, successful restructuring and also high financing book growth. However, the total problem financing ratio (impaired financing + restructured +PDNI>90 days) remains above the average of the bank's peers. Noor is diversifying from GREs, but the financing book remains highly concentrated by single name, with the 20 largest exposures representing 3X Fitch Core Capital (FCC) at end-2016. Noor's profitability has been strengthening as it is growing its financing book and improving its fees income through its focus on cross selling and trade financing. Liquidity in the market has tightened, but the bank maintained its net financing margin (NFM) at 2.9% in 2016 as it off loaded some of its expensive term deposits, comparing well with peers. The cost to income ratio is on a declining trend and was 40% in 2016, supported by its strengthening operating income but still higher than UAE peers' average. Financing impairment charges have been declining from the 2011 peak (93% of pre-impairment profit) but increased in 2016 to absorb 64% of pre-impairment as Noor is building its reserve coverage in preparation of IFRS 9 implementation. Noor's FCC ratio dropped to 10.9% at end- 2016 due to high financing book growth, lower than peers. The Tier 1 regulatory ratio improved to 16.3% at end-2016 after the bank completed its USD500 million Tier 1 sukuk issuance. We consider the bank's capital levels particularly low in light of its asset quality and high financing book concentration. Noor has healthy internal capital generation as it does not repatriate dividends. However, if internal capital generation does not pick up with balance sheet growth, the bank would need to raise additional capital to support its capital ratios. Noor has an adequate liquidity profile, which mitigates its high but falling deposit concentration given its small retail franchise. Liquid assets including cash balances less mandatory reserves, interbank placements and investment securities maturing within one year covered 28% of total deposits at end-2016. The financing to deposit ratio increased strongly to 93% at end-2016 (76% at end-2015) due to 13% financing book growth coupled with a 7% drop in deposits to preserve its margins, but still compares well with peers. We expect the ratio to drop in 2017 as the bank grows its deposits base with less pressure on its funding costs as liquidity started to improve in 1Q17. In assessing Noor's ratings, we considered important differences between Islamic and conventional banks. These factors include closer analysis of regulatory oversight, disclosure, accounting standards and corporate governance. Islamic banks' ratings do not express an opinion on the bank's compliance with sharia. Fitch will assess non-compliance with sharia if it has credit implications. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SR AND SRF Noor's IDRs, SR and SRF are sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of the UAE and Dubai authorities and on their propensity to support the banking system or the bank. The sukuk issuances under Noor Sukuk Ltd are rated in line with Noor's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same sensitivities VR Upside could arise from further evidence of Noor growing its franchise, diversifying its business model away from GREs and building a track record with no material deterioration in the bank's risk indicators and asset quality. The VR could be downgraded if there was a material deterioration in asset quality further impacting the bank's profitability and capitalisation.

Brendt Christensen, 28, arrested in Champaign, Illinois, was indicted for the June 9 kidnapping of Yingying Zhang, 26, after he was previously arrested and charged, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of Illinois said in a statement late Wednesday.  Authorities believe Zhang is dead although no body has been found.  Zhang, a scholar in photosynthesis and crop productivity, came several months ago to the University of Illinois, which draws thousands of students from China. Zhang was recorded by surveillance video on June 9 waiting for a bus and then entering a black car that police connected to Christensen. He later told investigators he picked up an Asian female and dropped her off a few blocks later. Federal agents put Christensen under surveillance and heard him  explaining  he kidnapped Zhang, court documents said. A search of the suspect's cellphone also found he had visited a website that included threads on  perfect abduction fantasy,  and  planning a kidnapping,  according to the criminal complaint. Christensen's attorney, Evan Bruno, said by phone on Thursday that the indictment was expected and that his client is still presumed innocent. Bruno said there is information that remains unknown in the case, and the legal process is likely to be a long one.  We're not even through the previews yet of the movie, and this is going to be a long movie,  Bruno said. As a result of Wednesday's indictment, a preliminary hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Eric Long of the U.S. District Court in Urbana scheduled for Friday was canceled, the U.S. attorney's office said. Christensen is scheduled to appear in court for an arraignment on July 20 in Urbana. The university's police department wrote in a tweet on Wednesday that officers are continuing their search for Zhang and the case is a  top priority.   Christensen, who is married, graduated from the university in May with a master's degree in physics, according to the university.  Audio captured after nearly two weeks of surveillance by authorities includes Christensen stating he had brought the victim back to his apartment and held her against her will, the criminal complaint said. It did not specify to whom he spoke. Zhang's case has garnered news coverage in China. If convicted, Christensen could face life in prison.

The maid lodged a complaint saying her employers had abused her, beaten her, locked her up and were withholding her salary, police said on Thursday. More than four million people are employed as domestic workers in India, most of them women, according to official data, and they are often exploited in the absence of legal protection, campaigners say. India's rising affluence and growing numbers of working women have spurred demand for such workers, and campaigners say there are likely to be millions more working in the unregulated sector. Family and friends of the maid, Zohra Bibi, gathered to protest outside the Noida apartment complex in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday. Stones were thrown at security guards, and riot police were called in. According to police, Bibi's employers accused her of stealing money. They also filed a complaint against her family, saying her relatives destroyed their property, they said. The maid was hospitalized, said independent journalist Nilanjana Bhowmick, who spoke to the maid and posted eye-witness accounts on the incident.  She clearly said she had been beaten up and locked just because she wanted to quit working in this house and was demanding her dues,  Bhowmick told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The abuse of domestic workers are  every-day stories  across India, said Chandan Kumar, national coordinator of the Bonded Labour Eradication Programme at the non-profit Action Aid.  Cases of rapes, murders, physical abuse, non-payment of wages are routinely reported in the local newspapers in Delhi. You name the labor right violation clause, and it is there.  A bill to improve conditions for domestic workers by introducing a minimum salary, social security benefits and mandatory time off is pending cabinet approval. It also recognizes homes as workplaces, where domestic workers would be entitled to decent work conditions. Several high-profile cases of abuse have been reported in recent years, with employers not paying maids, failing to provide with proper food and shelter, forcing them to work long hours and even locking them up when they go on holiday. Among residents who employ maids in the area where Bibi worked,  there is resentment and silence,  said Kalai Selvi of the National Domestic Workers' Movement.  They are scared.

The maid was hospitalized, said independent journalist Nilanjana Bhowmick, who spoke to the maid and posted eye-witness accounts on the incident.  She clearly said she had been beaten up and locked just because she wanted to quit working in this house and was demanding her dues,  Bhowmick told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The abuse of domestic workers are  every-day stories  across India, said Chandan Kumar, national coordinator of the Bonded Labour Eradication Programme at the non-profit Action Aid.  Cases of rapes, murders, physical abuse, non-payment of wages are routinely reported in the local newspapers in Delhi. You name the labor right violation clause, and it is there.  A bill to improve conditions for domestic workers by introducing a minimum salary, social security benefits and mandatory time off is pending cabinet approval. It also recognizes homes as workplaces, where domestic workers would be entitled to decent work conditions. Several high-profile cases of abuse have been reported in recent years, with employers not paying maids, failing to provide with proper food and shelter, forcing them to work long hours and even locking them up when they go on holiday. Among residents who employ maids in the area where Bibi worked,  there is resentment and silence,  said Kalai Selvi of the National Domestic Workers' Movement.  They are scared.

The British government, seeking to highlight confidence in the British economy, said Spanish firms had committed millions of pounds of investment to Britain to coincide with a three-day state visit by King Felipe and Queen Letizia. Addressing business leaders in London, Felipe hailed the close ties between Britain and Spain. But he said:  We cannot deny that the scenario originated by the UK decision to leave the EU has generated uncertainty and doubts for our companies ... We must make sure the current negotiations reduce this uncertainty to the minimum.  It is extremely important that the future framework of our relations establishes the conditions for a close economic relationship trying to minimize future obstacles and barriers.  Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis told the event that Spain wanted a Britain that continued to be  bound together  with the rest of Europe. Bilateral trade between the two countries was worth 40 billion pounds ($51.68 billion) in 2015 and more than 400 Spanish companies are registered in Britain, the British government said. Investment Investments announced on Thursday included Spanish manufacturer CAF (CAF.MC) committing 30 million pounds ($39 million) to build trains and trams at a new factory in Wales, creating 300 jobs, and Spanish infrastructure company Sacyr (SCYR.MC) unveiling plans for a new office in London. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and Spain's King Felipe pose for a photograph before a meeting in 10 Downing Street, in central London, Britain July 13, 2017.Leon Neal/PoolSpanish Trade Minister Maria Luisa Poncela said:  Our common goal should be to achieve strong and collaborative relations with the United Kingdom while trying to avoid any unnecessary damage to our trade and investment flows.     The pomp-laden state visit, which included a banquet hosted by Queen Elizabeth on Wednesday, aims to cement ties that have been strained by questions over the post-Brexit status of Gibraltar, a British territory on the southern tip of Spain. The future of Gibraltar, captured by Britain in 1704, and its 30,000 inhabitants will be a major point of contention in the Brexit talks. The EU has offered Spain a right of veto over the territory's post-Brexit relationship with the bloc.  Slideshow (14 Images)During an address to the British parliament on Wednesday, Felipe said he was confident Spain and Britain could work toward an acceptable arrangement over Gibraltar. Prime Minister Theresa May's spokeswoman said the issue of Gibraltar did not come up during a bilateral meeting between the British leader and Felipe on Thursday.  Spain are well aware of our position on Gibraltar,  she told reporters.  We don't see eye to eye on this issue ... The sovereignty of Gibraltar is not up for discussion.  The pair did discuss EU citizens' rights post-Brexit, however. On Wednesday, Felipe urged the British and Spanish governments to work to ensure the Brexit agreement provided sufficient assurance and certainty for such citizens.  The EU and Britain have yet to agree on guarantees for EU citizens living in the UK and British expats living in other EU countries. More than 300,000 Britons live in Spain and more than 130,000 Spaniards live in Britain.  (May) said we have made it a priority in the negotiations to guarantee the status of Spanish and other EU citizens living in the UK as part of a reciprocal deal,  the spokeswoman said.

Overcoming opposition in parliament to the pension changes has proved one of the toughest battles for Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman's Western-backed government.  This will allow us to do something that nobody has done before: reform the pension system in the interests of Ukrainian pensioners. This is the moment of truth,  Groysman said before the vote. The reform is designed to keep a widening pensions deficit in check, but it has faced stiff opposition from populist forces in parliament who say savings can be found without the planned partial increases to the retirement age. Currently Ukraine, whose 12 million pensioners number almost as many as the working population, spends more on pensions as a percentage of gross domestic product than almost any other country. The bill, which has to go through another round of voting in parliament to become law, was backed by 282 lawmakers, comfortably over the 226 required to pass. Groysman said the final vote on the reform would be held after the summer recess. Overhauling the pension system and lifting a ban on agricultural land sales are among laws Ukraine must pass to receive further cash under the IMF programme. That programme has been repeatedly delayed by stop-start reform efforts since it was agreed in 2015. Last Thursday, the central bank said it expected to receive $1.5 billion less this year from the Fund because of slow progress of the laws' through parliament.

A bailiff picks through the boxes and scribbles down notes - the start of what the new government says is a search for tens of millions of dollars of looted assets, an investigation that Jammeh's supporters have dismissed as a witch-hunt. A U.S. official in Banjul said Washington was planning to help and government staff say they are counting on World Bank assistance. The size of the Kanilai estate - just a fraction of Jammeh's holdings according to the government official leading the tour - shows the scale of the task ahead.  We suspect most of the things were taken away before he left - the treasure, possibly weapons and most of the vehicles,  said the bailiff from Gambia's high court, Modou Moussa Ceesay, taking an inventory of Jammeh's possessions.  The former president - accused by opponents and rights groups of widespread violations and corruption - fled Gambia in January as regional forces descended on the capital Banjul to enforce the results of an election he lost. He has not commented on the investigation from his new base in Equatorial Guinea. His still strong band of supporters left behind in the tiny West African state have called the plunder hunt a case of victor's justice. Tanks, Zebras, Camels Kanilai was Jammeh's birthplace and is now his most elaborate estate - complete with farm, mosque, tanks, multiple residences, jungle warfare training camp and vast private safari park housing exotic parrots, zebras, hyenas and camels.  Building materials lie next to an unfinished new palace, near a billboard of a smiling Jammeh embracing his family.      The justice ministry team inspected it all under the gaze of a group of Jammeh's relatives and supporters, all wearing the green T-shirts of his APRC party. One of them stuck up his middle finger at the visiting delegation. APRC head, Fabakary Tombong Jatta, later told Reuters he had no knowledge of any embezzlement of state funds or foreign assets owned by Jammeh.  These people just want anything with any link to Jammeh and that's not fair,  he said, calling the investigation  witch-hunting . New President Adama Barrow took office in January and set up a task force to track down Jammeh's assets in May.  Most of the paper trails are available,  Gambia's Solicitor General Cherno Marenah said. Cattle amble towards an archway at the entrance of former Gambian President Yahya JammehÕs estate in Kanilai, Gambia July 1, 2017.Emma FargeBut following those paper trails is proving time consuming. Investigators only made their first visit to the heavily fortified estate this month. Finance minister Amadou Sanneh last month said $100 million - more than a third of the annual budget - had been siphoned from state firms, in the riverside nation, nearly half of whose 1.8 million people live in poverty.  A list of Jammeh assets temporarily seized by the government pending a court order showed 14 businesses in everything from media, insurance to farming. Sanneh said the government planned to sell four of Jammeh's presidential planes.  Too Much for One Man  Slideshow (7 Images)Marenah said investigators were also looking into assets in Morocco and the United States, where one U.S. official told Reuters Jammeh owned property in Potomac, Maryland, a wealthy suburb of Washington, D.C.  An official in the U.S. embassy in Banjul confirmed that they were collaborating with the Gambian government on how to assist with the recovery efforts. The World Bank would help Gambia through its Stolen Assets Recovery Programme, Marenah said, though the bank declined to comment. Back at Kanilai, once a small village near the border with Senegal, soldiers lead a tour of Jammeh's main residences.  The screeches of three of his abandoned parrots echo inside an empty ballroom hanging with crystal chandeliers. One of the pictures hanging on the wall shows a young Jammeh holding a staff some Gambians thought gave him mystical powers - he long said he had developed a secret cure for AIDS.

Tiffany, which has been struggling to turn around sales amid faltering demand for its high-end jewelry, named Alessandro Bogliolo chief executive, months after it added ex-Bulgari CEO Francesco Trapani to its board. A veteran luxury industry executive who has spent 16 years at Bulgari - now owned by French multinational LVMH (LVMH.PA) - Bogliolo most recently served as the chief executive of apparel and accessories company Diesel SpA. At Diesel, Bogliolo led a turnaround strategy aimed at reclaiming the company's luxury image, by scaling back sales to wholesale customers and improving customer service. He succeeds Frederic Cumenal, who stepped down in February after nearly two years with Tiffany, during which its sales declined and its stock dropped 9 percent. After Cumenal's exit, hedge fund Jana Partners revealed a stake in Tiffany and struck a surprise deal to add three directors to its board, including Trapani, who was also named to the company's CEO search committee.  We believe the new leadership will be key in accelerating the pace of product newness and innovation, as well as efforts to improve the in-store experience and drive stronger conversion amidst a challenged traffic backdrop,  Jefferies & Co analyst Randal Konik said in a note. Tiffany's shares were up 2 percent at $94.26 on Thursday. Bogliolo's resume also includes stints as COO of beauty products chain Sephora and as an executive at consulting firm Bain & Co. Sephora is also owned by LVMH. He is expected to take over as Tiffany's CEO and join the board by Oct. 2. Bogliolo's appointment comes at a time Tiffany is struggling to attract young shoppers who are either spending less on accessories or are turning to chic brands such as Pandora A/S and Alex and Ani. Tiffany has responded by launching gold and silver fashion jewelry to lure millennials to its stores. In January, the company hired former Coach Inc (COH.N) creative director Reed Krakoff as its first chief artistic officer and named pop star Lady Gaga as the face of its fashion jewelry collection, Tiffany Hardware. Still, Tiffany reported a surprise drop in first-quarter comparable sales in May, underscoring its struggles with weak demand at home and a strong dollar that has crimped spending by tourists.

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, known as a skillful tactician, released the updated legislation in a bid to unite disparate Republican factions and make good on his party's seven-year mission to gut Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. The proposal replaces an earlier one that deeply divided Trump's fellow Republicans, who control the Senate, drawing opposition from both moderates and hard-line conservatives. McConnell has planned for a vote on the new bill next week. The revised plan included conservative Senator Ted Cruz's proposal to let insurers offer stripped-down, low-cost healthcare plans that do not comply with Obamacare regulations to cover certain health benefits. Those benefits include maternity and newborn care, mental health services and addiction treatment, outpatient care, hospitalization, emergency room visits and prescription drugs. Insurer groups, including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, have derided these  skinny plans,  saying they would raise insurance premiums, destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions. The legislation retained two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law. They are: a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000; and an 0.9 percent surtax for the Medicare insurance program for the elderly on people with those incomes. The bill retained the previous draft bill's phaseout of the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled and sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025. Like the earlier version, it would repeal certain Obamacare taxes, end a penalty on individuals who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. Moderate Republicans had been hoping to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version. While companies can generally deduct employee salaries as a business expense, Obamacare capped the tax deductions on health insurance executive salaries at $500,000, and the new Senate bill will keep that cap. Hospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the Senate Republican approach, particularly proposed Medicaid cuts. The cuts would result in lower revenues for hospitals like Community Health Systems Inc and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare and Centene Corp . The Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people, in large part through expanding Medicaid. The bill would allow people to use health savings accounts to help pay for insurance premiums and contains an additional $70 billion to help low-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses. It also includes $45 billion for fighting the opioid addiction epidemic hitting large parts of the nation. Repealing and replacing Obamacare, which Republicans fault as a costly government intrusion into the healthcare system, was a top campaign promise for Trump, who was monitoring the Senate developments during his visit to France. McConnell has little room for error, as even three  no  votes among Republican senators would sink the legislation in the 100-seat Senate because Democrats are united against it. Republicans have a 52-48 majority, with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a potential tie-breaking vote. But 10 Republican senators had voiced opposition to the previous version of the bill, and McConnell faced a difficult task in coming up with a plan that could unite party moderates and hard-line conservatives. Alternative Plan Complicating matters further, two Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, offered an alternative healthcare proposal minutes before McConnell unveiled his new plan. It would redirect much of Obamacare's federal funding for health insurance to states. The fact that Republicans still lack consensus on what to do with Obamacare after calling for its demise since Congress passed it in 2010 with only Democratic votes shows that it is no sure thing that Trump's party will be able to get the job done. The House of Representatives on May 4 passed its own version of healthcare legislation. Healthcare is Trump's first major legislative initiative, and failure would call into question his party's ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House. Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Wednesday he would be  very angry  if he does not get a bill on his desk to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare. Trump put pressure on McConnell, saying he  has to pull it off  in the Senate. Moderate Republican senators have been uneasy about a forecast that millions of people would lose medical insurance under the legislation, while hard-line conservatives say it leaves too much of Obamacare intact. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast that the previous Senate healthcare bill would increase the number of people without health insurance by 22 million by 2026. While ending a fine on people who decline to obtain insurance, the Senate bill would force people who let their coverage lapse to wait six months before coverage could resume. The provision is intended to stop people from waiting until getting ill to buy health insurance because insurers need to have lots of healthy people obtaining policies to offset the expense of care for sick people.

The decree, which violated FIFA's rules banning government interference in its member associations, has been dropped and Mutasim Gaafar reinstated as SFA president along with its board of directors, FIFA said. Gaafar was removed from his post by the Ministry of Justice, with police evicting members of his executive, and replaced by Abdel Rahman Elkatim.

The Viability Rating (VR) has also been affirmed at 'bb+'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AND DEBT SIB's IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor reflect the high probability of support available to the bank from the UAE and Sharjah authorities if needed. Fitch's view of support factors in the sovereign's strong capacity to support the banking system, sustained by sovereign wealth funds and recurring revenues mostly from hydrocarbon production, despite lower oil prices, and the moderate size of the UAE banking sector in relation to the country's GDP. Fitch also expects high willingness from the authorities to support the banking sector, which has been demonstrated by the UAE authorities' long track record of supporting domestic banks, as well as close ties with and part government ownership links to a number of banks. SIB's Support Rating Floor is two notches below the UAE Domestic Systemically Important Banks's (D-SIB) Support Rating Floor of 'A', due to Fitch's view that SIB is less systematically important based on SIB's approximate 1% market share of total assets in the UAE banking system at end-2016, and the bank's niche corporate focus. The sukuk issued by SIB Sukuk Company III Limited (100%-owned subsidiary) under SIB's trust certificate issuance programme are rated in line with the bank's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same rating drivers. VR SIB's VR reflects the bank's modest franchise, high impaired financing ratio, high financing concentration, adequate reserve coverage, as well as acceptable management and strategy. It also factors in the bank's sound funding profile, stable liquidity position, strong capital ratios and consistent profitability. It also takes into account sizeable concentrations on both sides of the balance sheet. SIB's VR is constrained by the bank's modest franchise, although the bank benefits from its close ties to the Sharjah government. SIB's market share is approximately 1% of both UAE banking system assets and deposits at end-2016, which limits the bank's pricing power and competitive advantage. SIB's financing book is characterised by high obligor and sector concentrations. Related-party financing is large, although predominantly to the Sharjah government and related government projects, particularly infrastructure. Impaired financing is high, despite continued improvement over the preceding four years. Reserves for impaired financing have improved over the preceding four years with a cover of 93% of impaired financing at end-2016. SIB has stronger capital ratios (the Fitch Core Capital ratio was about 20% at end-2016) than Fitch-rated UAE banks. SIB's management intends to keep the total regulatory capital ratio above 18%.  At end-2016, the Tier 1 regulatory ratio was 20.4%. The total regulatory capital ratio was 21.4%. If capital above the minimum regulatory requirement is added to loss reserves, then the loss reserve/gross financing ratio increases to 18% from 5.6%, providing a satisfactory capital buffer. SIB is largely funded by stable customer deposits, which accounted for about 66% of total non-equity funding at end-2016. Customer deposits are concentrated, with 25% government-related, and have been historically stable. SIB complements its deposit funding with three Sukuk issues, demonstrating good access to capital markets when required. SIB has a large stock of liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents, short-term interbank placement and liquid securities) equivalent to 49% of deposits, providing a good liquidity cushion. SIB's financing-to-deposits ratio is in line with peers'. Earnings and profitability metrics have been stable, but continue to sit below peers'. Fitch's key earnings and profitability metric, operating profit/ risk-weighted assets (RWAs), has been consistent, ranging between 1.8% and 2.1% over the preceding four years. Over the same period, UAE peers have demonstrated on average a stable 2.2% for the same metric. A combination of a lower-risk, lower-yielding financing focus and comparatively higher cost-to- income ratio is why SIB's overall profitability has remained, and is likely to continue, below the industry average. In assessing the ratings of SIB, we considered important differences between Islamic and conventional banks. These factors include closer analysis of regulatory oversight, disclosure, accounting standards and corporate governance. Islamic banks' ratings do not express an opinion on the bank's compliance with sharia. Fitch will assess non-compliance with sharia if it has credit implications. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORTING RATING FLOOR AND DEBT SIB's IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of the UAE authorities and on their propensity to support the banking system or the bank. The sukuk issued by SIB Sukuk Company III Limited under the SIB's trust certificate issuance programme are rated in line with the bank's IDRs and therefore subject to the same sensitivities.

Financial markets overwhelmingly expect the ECB to decide in September on the future of its stimulus policy beyond the end of this year. Some investors expect an extension with a one-off reduction while others see a gradual but steady wind-down, known as tapering. ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door last month to tweaks to the bank's stimulus policy, arguing that growth is providing the 19-nation euro zone economy with support so the ECB could scale back stimulus to maintain the overall level of accommodation.  Central bank officials who spoke to Reuters recently have pointed to September or, at the latest, October as a likely time for a decision but stressed this depended on economic data and market conditions. Draghi is scheduled to speak at the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium just two weeks before the ECB's Sept. 7 meeting.

The direction and timing of the communication would make sense to us,  ABN Amro economist Nick Kounis said in a note.  Indeed, our base case is that the ECB will announce a tapering of its asset purchases from January 2018 onwards at the September meeting.

Trump has pledged to boost annual growth to 3 percent, the average for much of the last 70 years, and predicated an earlier tax plan on reaching that figure.  The Fed, the Congressional Budget Office and others feel that an aging population and lagging productivity mean the economy's potential has downshifted to around 2 percent growth or less - a fact that has profound effects on national wealth as the slower pace compounds over time. Related CoverageFed's Yellen prepared to act against Wells' board if appropriate I think it is something that would be wonderful if you could accomplish it,  Yellen said at a Senate committee hearing.  I think it would be quite challenging,  and require a broad set of changes from tax reform to an improved education system that adds to labor productivity. Yellen's appearance before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs covered much of the same ground as her session with a House committee on Wednesday where she said the Fed's plans for further gradual rate increases and a slow drawdown of its balance sheet remain on track.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the 'Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress' on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. July 13, 2017.Carlos BarriaShe also indicated the Fed agreed with some of the suggested changes to the current bank regulatory system that congressional Republicans and the administration have advocated, such as easing the strict Volcker rule on bank securities trading, and limiting application of the most stringent regulations to only the very largest institutions. However the Senate panel pressed her for ideas about boosting economic growth, asking whether Trump's goal is achievable, and whether things like tax reform in particular might help. Slideshow (2 Images)Yellen said she would not offer specific details on a topic that is Congress' prerogative. But she said there was  general agreement that there are distortions in the corporate tax code  that could be changed to improve productivity. In general, she said that moving annual productivity growth back above two percent - about double the pace of recent years - would be a monumental task. Growth in productivity and growth in the number of workers are key components of growth overall, and both are now moving slowly. Along with tax reform,  I would focus on training, on education...I would focus on investment both public and private. I would focus on policies that affect the pace of technological change,  Yellen said.

Tiffany, which has been struggling to turn around sales amid faltering demand for its high-end jewelry, named Alessandro Bogliolo chief executive, months after it added ex-Bulgari CEO Francesco Trapani to its board. A veteran luxury industry executive who has spent 16 years at Bulgari - now owned by French multinational LVMH (LVMH.PA) - Bogliolo most recently served as the chief executive of apparel and accessories company Diesel SpA. At Diesel, Bogliolo led a turnaround strategy aimed at reclaiming the company's luxury image, by scaling back sales to wholesale customers and improving customer service. He succeeds Frederic Cumenal, who stepped down in February after nearly two years with Tiffany, during which its sales declined and its stock dropped 9 percent. After Cumenal's exit, hedge fund Jana Partners revealed a stake in Tiffany and struck a surprise deal to add three directors to its board, including Trapani, who was also named to the company's CEO search committee.  We believe the new leadership will be key in accelerating the pace of product newness and innovation, as well as efforts to improve the in-store experience and drive stronger conversion amidst a challenged traffic backdrop,  Jefferies & Co analyst Randal Konik said in a note. Tiffany's shares were up 2 percent at $94.26 on Thursday. Bogliolo's resume also includes stints as COO of beauty products chain Sephora and as an executive at consulting firm Bain & Co. Sephora is also owned by LVMH. He is expected to take over as Tiffany's CEO and join the board by Oct. 2. Bogliolo's appointment comes at a time Tiffany is struggling to attract young shoppers who are either spending less on accessories or are turning to chic brands such as Pandora A/S and Alex and Ani. Tiffany has responded by launching gold and silver fashion jewelry to lure millennials to its stores. In January, the company hired former Coach Inc (COH.N) creative director Reed Krakoff as its first chief artistic officer and named pop star Lady Gaga as the face of its fashion jewelry collection, Tiffany Hardware. Still, Tiffany reported a surprise drop in first-quarter comparable sales in May, underscoring its struggles with weak demand at home and a strong dollar that has crimped spending by tourists.

A bailiff picks through the boxes and scribbles down notes - the start of what the new government says is a search for tens of millions of dollars of looted assets, an investigation that Jammeh's supporters have dismissed as a witch-hunt. A U.S. official in Banjul said Washington was planning to help and government staff say they are counting on World Bank assistance. The size of the Kanilai estate - just a fraction of Jammeh's holdings according to the government official leading the tour - shows the scale of the task ahead.  We suspect most of the things were taken away before he left - the treasure, possibly weapons and most of the vehicles,  said the bailiff from Gambia's high court, Modou Moussa Ceesay, taking an inventory of Jammeh's possessions.  The former president - accused by opponents and rights groups of widespread violations and corruption - fled Gambia in January as regional forces descended on the capital Banjul to enforce the results of an election he lost. He has not commented on the investigation from his new base in Equatorial Guinea. His still strong band of supporters left behind in the tiny West African state have called the plunder hunt a case of victor's justice. Tanks, Zebras, Camels Kanilai was Jammeh's birthplace and is now his most elaborate estate - complete with farm, mosque, tanks, multiple residences, jungle warfare training camp and vast private safari park housing exotic parrots, zebras, hyenas and camels.  Building materials lie next to an unfinished new palace, near a billboard of a smiling Jammeh embracing his family.      The justice ministry team inspected it all under the gaze of a group of Jammeh's relatives and supporters, all wearing the green T-shirts of his APRC party. One of them stuck up his middle finger at the visiting delegation. APRC head, Fabakary Tombong Jatta, later told Reuters he had no knowledge of any embezzlement of state funds or foreign assets owned by Jammeh.  These people just want anything with any link to Jammeh and that's not fair,  he said, calling the investigation  witch-hunting . New President Adama Barrow took office in January and set up a task force to track down Jammeh's assets in May.  Most of the paper trails are available,  Gambia's Solicitor General Cherno Marenah said. Cattle amble towards an archway at the entrance of former Gambian President Yahya JammehÕs estate in Kanilai, Gambia July 1, 2017.Emma FargeBut following those paper trails is proving time consuming. Investigators only made their first visit to the heavily fortified estate this month. Finance minister Amadou Sanneh last month said $100 million - more than a third of the annual budget - had been siphoned from state firms, in the riverside nation, nearly half of whose 1.8 million people live in poverty.  A list of Jammeh assets temporarily seized by the government pending a court order showed 14 businesses in everything from media, insurance to farming. Sanneh said the government planned to sell four of Jammeh's presidential planes.  Too Much for One Man  Slideshow (7 Images)Marenah said investigators were also looking into assets in Morocco and the United States, where one U.S. official told Reuters Jammeh owned property in Potomac, Maryland, a wealthy suburb of Washington, D.C.  An official in the U.S. embassy in Banjul confirmed that they were collaborating with the Gambian government on how to assist with the recovery efforts. The World Bank would help Gambia through its Stolen Assets Recovery Programme, Marenah said, though the bank declined to comment. Back at Kanilai, once a small village near the border with Senegal, soldiers lead a tour of Jammeh's main residences.  The screeches of three of his abandoned parrots echo inside an empty ballroom hanging with crystal chandeliers. One of the pictures hanging on the wall shows a young Jammeh holding a staff some Gambians thought gave him mystical powers - he long said he had developed a secret cure for AIDS. A pile of paperwork including an old business document from a visiting Royal Dutch Shell delegation sits near a bookshelf holding Adolf Hitler's  Mein Kampf  and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's memoir,  The Downing Street Years . At the entrance to another residence, soldiers swap jokes and take turns playing on a grand piano and shooting pool next to a fake Christmas tree.  It's too much for one man,  mutters one of them as the delegation tours the rooms.

I think I stepped on the court super-confident and I played well,  said Muguruza, who in the absence of her regular coach is being guided at this tournament by Conchita Martinez, the only Spaniard to win the women's singles title at the All England Club. Related CoverageMuguruza faces another Williams final showdownI didn't know what to do, says crushed RybarikovaThe women's tournament this year has been marked by some fiercely contested and tight battles but this was a disappointingly one-sided affair.  It was very difficult match for me. I have to say Garbine played an amazing match. I never saw her playing that well,  said Rybarikova. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 13, 2017   Slovakia’s Magdalena Rybarikova in action during her semi final match against Spain’s Garbine MuguruzaTony O'Brien Obviously, I was little bit nervous in the beginning. It was not my best day. But she didn't give me much chance to do anything,  she said. Muguruza appeared with heavy tape on her left thigh but there was no sign of any hindrance to her movement. Indeed, she was simply stronger in every department, hitting 22 winners and just 11 unforced errors as she won 60 points to Rybarikova's 33 with her backhand down the line, fundamental to her win. Slideshow (2 Images)The Venezuela-born 23-year-old, the 2016 French Open winner, was quick to the net and her groundstrokes flowed easily as she rattled off the first set in just 30 minutes. Rybarikova's first service game of the second set was broken, and a sizzling backhand return winner down the line from Muguruza, the shot of the match, established another 3-0 lead. Rybarikova had done remarkably well to reach this stage after a seventh month injury lay-off, getting herself into great form by winning International Tennis Federation tournaments at Fukuoka, Surbiton and Ilkley. But this was a step too far. Even when she was able to hold in the second, she needed to stave off two break points to do so. The final point was a rare rally but it ended with Rybarikova finding the net after being forced into the corner by Muguruza's relentless returns.

Talk that more capacity cuts were on the way in China fed into broader-based concerns over slowing output to push prices higher, analysts said. An industry association said last month that China will launch a crackdown to curb the illegal expansion of production capacity.  There's some talk circulating of some more smelter closures as this regulatory monitoring is ongoing,  Societe Generale analyst Robin Bhar said.  The supply-side reforms in China seem to be catching the headlines again, and that is spurring some fund buying that is coming through.

Cuba's government since 2016 has reduced fuel allocations 28 percent to most state-run companies, and has cut electricity consumption. Public lighting was cut 50 percent, while residential electric use was spared.  Beginning in March, Cubans also have reported minor gasoline and diesel shortages at service stations. Cuba's economy depends heavily on Venezuelan crude shipments under a series of bilateral agreements started in 2000 by the South American country's late President Hugo Chavez. In return, the island nation has provided Venezuela with Cuban doctors and other services. Venezuela's shipments of crude for Cuba's refineries dropped 21 percent to 42,310 bpd, the documents showed. Last year, Venezuela made up for a shortfall in crude shipments by sending Cuba more fuels, but this year's data showed refined products sent to Cuba remained almost unchanged at around 30,040 bpd. In total, PDVSA sent Cuba an average of 72,350 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and refined products in the first half of 2017, down almost 13 percent from the same period of last year, according to the data from internal PDVSA trade reports. (Link to Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2tf4Fk8)  The source who provided the documents to Reuters asked not to be named.   Cuba needs at least 70,000 bpd from Venezuela to cover its energy deficit and avoid deeper rationing. A larger or total loss of the Venezuelan supply would have a high political and financial cost for Cuba,  which has been gearing up to welcome more tourists, said Jorge Pinon, a Cuban energy expert at the University of Texas in Austin. Cuba suffered severe energy rationing in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union, an ally that had provided cheap fuel. In 2016, Cuba's economy went into recession for the first time since those days, declining almost 1 percent as shrinking export earnings left it short of funds to import oil on the open market and replace declining Venezuelan supplies. With Venezuela's crude production sliding in 2017 for the sixth year in a row, the OPEC nation has had less oil to send Cuba and other customers in regions from Asia to North America and the Caribbean. Cuba, which produces extremely heavy crude used by industry and power plants, received 103,226 bpd of oil from Venezuela in the first half of 2015, according to the same data. PDVSA, whose full name is Petroleos de Venezuela SA, did not reply to a request for comment. Venezuela's oil shipments to Cuba have been falling since 2008, when they peaked at 115,000 bpd mainly due to a decline in crude exports. The poor shape of Venezuelan refineries cut into fuel exports this year, and Venezuela has also had to boost fuel imports to meet domestic demand. Cuba, in addition to rationing fuel, is seeking oil cargoes from other producers including Russia, something it had not done for more than a decade. In one of several recent shipments, the Ocean Quest tanker loaded with fuel oil at Russia's Tuapse terminal, arrived in Havana on July 9 and is waiting to discharge, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. The Tuapse terminal is operated by state-run Rosneft.  Cuba's three aged refineries have been operating at reduced rates since last year due to a shortage of light crude, which also affects Venezuela's 1.3-million-bpd refining network.

A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AND DEBT ADIB's IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor reflect the extremely high probability of support available to the bank from the UAE and Abu Dhabi authorities if needed. Fitch's view of support factors in the sovereign's strong capacity to support the banking system, sustained by sovereign wealth funds and recurring revenue mostly from hydrocarbon production, despite lower oil prices, and the moderate size of the UAE banking sector in relation to the country's GDP. Fitch also expects high willingness from the authorities to support the banking sector, which has been demonstrated by the UAE authorities' long track record of supporting domestic banks, as well as close ties with and part government ownership links to a number of banks. ADIB's Support Rating Floor is at the Abu Dhabi Domestic Systemically Important Banks's (D-SIB) Support Rating Floor of 'A+', reflecting the bank's high systemic importance. Abu Dhabi banks' D-SIB Support Rating Floor is one notch higher than other UAE banks, due to Abu Dhabi's superior financial flexibility. ADIB Sukuk Company is rated in line with the bank's IDRs and is therefore subject to the same rating drivers. VR ADIB's VR reflects the bank's strong and resilient UAE-wide franchise, moderate pre-impairment profitability and sound balance sheet liquidity. However, the VR is undermined by weak asset quality and core capitalisation, sizeable balance sheet concentrations and high related-party lending. ADIB has maintained its 5% market share of UAE banking assets. It is the second largest UAE Islamic bank behind Dubai Islamic Bank and the fourth largest Islamic bank globally by total assets. Pre-impairment profitability is solid, at 3.7% of average gross loans in 1Q17, providing the bank with adequate ability to absorb potential credit losses through profits. ADIB's strong UAE-wide franchise is a strength for the bank's funding and liquidity. Customer deposits account for 93% of the bank's total funding base. Liquid assets cover 20% of total assets and 25% of total deposits, and the bank's loans-to-deposits ratio (79% at end-1Q17) compares well with UAE peer average. At end-1Q17 ADIB reported an impaired financing ratio of only 4.2%. However, when adding restructured exposures and 90 days past due but not impaired exposures, the problem financing ratio reached 10.9% at end-1Q17. While the coverage of impaired financing is sufficient at 92%, reserves coverage of problem loans is weak, at just below 35%. In addition, related-party financing accounts for 60% of equity. The major part of this financing is exposure to ADIB's controlling shareholder, translating into high financing concentration, with the top 20 exposures making up 22% of total gross financing. ADIB's Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio stood at a low 9.99% at end-1Q17 (compared with a peer average of 14.7%) although an improvement from 8.15% at end-2014 due to an AED504 million rights issue and lower financing growth. ADIB's regulatory Tier 1 ratio was adequate at 15.23% at end-1Q17, while the total capital ratio stood at 15.85%. With these capital ratios the bank could increase financing impairment reserves up to 9.2% of gross financing without breaching the 12% minimum requirement for capital adequacy ratio, which is below the bank's problem financing ratio. In assessing the ratings of ADIB, we considered important differences between Islamic and conventional banks. These factors include closer analysis of regulatory oversight, disclosure, accounting standards and corporate governance. Islamic banks' ratings do not express an opinion on the bank's compliance with sharia. Fitch will assess non-compliance with sharia if it has credit implications. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AND DEBT ADIB's IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of the UAE and Abu Dhabi authorities and on their propensity to support the banking system or the bank. The sukuk issued under ADIB Sukuk Company are subject to the same sensitivities as the bank's IDRs. VR Pressure on ADIB's VR could result from deterioration in asset quality or core capital ratios, particularly concerning the recovery of legacy exposures. A sustained improvement in asset quality and capital ratios could lead to an upgrade of the VR. The rating actions are as follows: Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'A+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F1' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb' Support Rating affirmed at '1' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'A+' ADIB Sukuk Company Limited: Trust certificate issuance programme affirmed at 'A+'/'F1' CRITERIA VARIATION: Under Fitch's Global Bank Rating Criteria, Fitch's SRFs are based on the ability and propensity of the government to provide support. Within the UAE, Fitch assesses the potential for support at federal level as Fitch believes that support would be forthcoming from the UAE authorities acting together. However, in respect of Abu Dhabi, Fitch has varied the criteria to reflect the superior financial flexibility of the Abu Dhabi authorities. As such, the SRFs for banks in Abu Dhabi are based on Fitch's assessment of the ability and propensity of the Abu Dhabi authorities to provide support in its own right. This results in a one notch higher SRF for Abu Dhabi banks (compared with other UAE banks), and results in a notch-higher rating for the bank.

Existing investors including funds Breyer Capital, Goodwater Capital and Valar Ventures, the venture capital firm of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, also participated in the new round, Stash said on Thursday. Stash has developed a mobile app that seeks to make it easier for low-income consumers in the United States to start saving and investing. Starting with as little as $5, users can pick from a batch of over 30 exchange-traded-funds curated by the company's investment team. The app, which charges $1 per month for accounts under $5,000, also offers the option to set automatic investments to help users grow their  stash  over time. It charges a 0.25 percent annual fee for accounts over $5,000. Stash is among a growing cohort of tech-savvy investment managers taking advantage of automation and digital technologies to service consumers usually overlooked by the mainstream wealth management industry.  We help people who don't have a lot save money on a weekly basis,  Brandon Krieg, chief executive and co-founder of Stash, said in an interview.  Stashers look like America, they look like people you meet every day: they are nurses and teachers and Uber and Lyft drivers.  Stash services 850,000 accounts, having added over half a million investors on its platform since the start of the year alone. Around 86 percent of its users are first-time investors, it said. Stash's monthly subscription model for smaller accounts sets it apart from more established online wealth management startups known as robo-advisors, who typically only charge fees based on assets under management. This makes the company's revenue stream less reliant on quickly growing the amount of money their clients invest through their platform, Krieg said. Robo-advisors, however, will not generally allow their customers to pick the ETFs they invest in but use computer algorithms to create and manage portfolios based on their risk profile. Stash, which has raised $78 million in less than two years, will use the latest injection of cash to enhance its technology, expand its team and launch new products, it said, including a new platform for simplified retirement saving.

Target's forecast of a  modest  increase in second-quarter same-store sales on Thursday boosted brick-and-mortar retail stocks, which took a beating last month when Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) agreed to buy upmarket grocer Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) in a deal that could potentially upend the retail market. Macy's Inc's (M.N) and Kohl's Corp's (KSS.N) shares were up about 4 percent, while Wal-Mart's were up 1.4 percent. Discount retailer Dollar Tree Inc's (DLTR.O) shares rose 1.3 percent and Costco Wholesale Corp's stock (COST.O) was up 1 percent. Target also said it expects second-quarter profit to come in above its forecast range of $0.95 per share to $1.15 per share.

Zolidis added, however, that it would still take sustained improvement to convince the market that Target had found a  true path forward.  Target's stock has fallen about 30 percent since the start of the year, dropping to levels last seen in early 2012 due in part to what some analysts consider a confusing grocery offering and an inability to engage customers. Empty shopping carts sit inside prior to the Black Friday sale event on Thanksgiving Day at Target in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 24, 2016.Kamil KrzaczynskiIn February, the retailer vowed aggressive promotions at a meeting with investors, saying new brands and investments in technology and small stores would help it eventually win back market share.     Anand Raghuraman, principal and retail consultant at EY, said he expected volatility in retail to continue despite these optimistic second-quarter sales forecasts.  It's safe to say that investors are looking for any sign of positive news in this time of turbulence. There haven’t been many retailers that have escaped the effects of e-commerce and other emerging consumer trends recently,  Raghuraman said. Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom said Target's previous same store sales guidance might have simply been conservative, adding that other retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Costco and Dollar Tree, were still better value.  Target, which had previously forecast a low single-digit decline in comparable sales, is expected to report second-quarter results on Aug. 16.

Slack in job markets, stubbornly low inflation and the disruptive effect of technology across industries from retailing to financial services along with off-shoring of manufacturing to low-cost locations have kept wage growth subdued and profit margins high across markets in the United States, Western Europe and the advanced economies of Asia. Fat profit margins have lifted global stock markets to all-time highs yet wage growth remains well-below average levels, giving credence to the old investment adage that what is good for shareholders is bad for employees. Now, with most developed markets running at or near full employment and inflation potentially lurking around the corner, market participants say companies will likely face rising pressure to raise wages. The world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock, noted the potential of wage pressures to build as one of the risks to their otherwise sanguine assessment of the outlook for global stock markets. The firm continues to prefer stocks over bonds.  The share of income going to labor (wages) is historically low and corporate margins are elevated,  BlackRock's strategists warned in their mid-year investment outlook review published this week.   Any policies that reverse this trend – or labor shortages causing wages to spike – could erode margins and equity valuations.  Corporate profit margins in the United States will be a key area to watch as second-quarter results season gets underway next week. American companies' operating profit margins are currently running close to 20 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, only slightly below the peaks seen in 2001 and 2007. Morning commuters pass by the New York Stock Exchange September 15, 2014.Brendan McDermidHigher wages and declining productivity will likely eat into corporate margins throughout the rest of this year and next as companies pay more to recruit and train workers at a time when unemployment is near multi-year lows, said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York.  The Trade-Off Global profit growth, running at about 10 percent currently, has far outpaced sales growth, which is less than half that, according to Thomson Reuters data. The difference points to profit growth being boosted in part by cost-cutting. However, a global recovery in economic growth gathering steam points to demand finally picking up.  This is the first year of a synchronized global recovery and a lot of the profit growth we're seeing is because of actual demand increasing and not just cost cuts. Wage growth will pick up albeit at a moderate pace,  said Dale Winner, a fund manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management who runs a portfolio of global stocks. Broadly, the outlook for equities remains bright as relative valuations compared with bonds remain appealing.  I think we're going to deal with higher inflation, and companies with margin compression, but that’s not necessarily a game-ender,  said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. Investors are likely to increasingly distinguish, however, between companies and sectors that are able to pass on costs of a higher wage bill to their customers and protect margins versus those that will have to take the hit.  The crunch will hurt low-margin businesses like supermarkets the most, while leaving technology companies with larger margins – such as Microsoft or Oracle – relatively unscathed, Federated's Orlando said.  If there's a trade-off between a faster-growing economy and rising wages hitting margins, I will take the faster-growing economy in a heartbeat,  he said.For graphic on corporate EBITDA margins click reut.rs/2tMB1XcFor graphic on real wage growth click reut.rs/2tilhaK Reporting by Vikram Subhedar; Additional reporting by David Randall and Rodrigo Campos in New York; Editing by Hugh Lawson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wages-margins-analysis-idUSKBN19Y22I"},

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. Mourning his death, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Liu a  courageous fighter for civil rights and freedom of expression , while the French and U.S. governments called on China to allow Liu's family to move around freely. Already seriously ill, Liu, a thorn in the ruling Communist Party's side since he helped negotiate a deal to allow protesters to leave Tiananmen Square before troops and tanks rolled in, was moved last month from prison to a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang to be treated. The Shenyang Bureau of Justice said in a brief statement on its website that Liu had suffered multiple organ failure and efforts to save him had failed. Despite being given multiple forms of treatment his illness had continued to worsen, it added. The hospital treating him confirmed in a separate statement the cause of death. Though allowed out on medical parole he was never freed, spending his final days in the hospital surrounded by security guards. The leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee which, to Beijing's ire, awarded Liu the peace prize in 2010, said the Chinese government bore a heavy responsibility for his death.  We find it deeply disturbing that Liu Xiaobo was not transferred to a facility where he could receive adequate medical treatment before he became terminally ill,  said Berit Reiss-Andersen in an emailed statement. China said at the time that Liu's award was an  obscenity  that should not have gone to a man it called a criminal and a subversive. Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist who died in 1938 in Nazi Germany's Berlin, was the last Nobel Peace Prize winner to live out his dying days under state surveillance. Reform Call Western government and rights groups expressed sorrow at Liu's death, and criticised Beijing for not allowing him to seek treatment for his cancer overseas.  China has lost a deeply principled role model who deserved our respect and adulation, not the prison sentences to which he was subjected,  said U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad in a statement that also called on Beijing to release all prisoners of conscience. Tsai Ing-wen, the president of self-ruled Taiwan which China regards as a wayward province, said on her Facebook page the island hoped China could now show self-confidence and promote political reform following Liu's death.  Only through democracy, in which every Chinese person has freedom and respect, can China truly become a proud and important country,  she said. In China, while mention of Liu's passing was swiftly removed from Weibo, the country's answer to Twitter, images and comments were shared on the WeChat messaging service. Some activists shared a picture of a black screen with the years 1955-2017 - his lifespan - or of a single candle superimposed over his face.  Mr. Liu, rest in peace,  wrote rights lawyer Zhang Peihong on his WeChat account. State news agency Xinhua reported the death only in English in a brief story that noted he had been seen by  China's top-rated cancer experts . Freedom of Movement United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein urged China to guarantee his widow, Liu Xia, freedom of movement, and allow her to travel abroad should she want to. Liu Xia has lived under house arrest since 2010.  Despite the imprisonment and separation from the wife he adored that could have fuelled anger and bitterness, Liu Xiaobo declared that he had no hatred for those who pursued and prosecuted him,  Zeid said. Rights groups and Western governments had urged China to allow Liu and his wife to leave the country to be treated abroad, as Liu had said he wanted. But the government had warned repeatedly against interference and said Liu was being treated by renowned Chinese cancer experts. The hospital had said he was too sick to travel. Beijing did allow two foreign doctors, from the United States and Germany, to visit Liu on Saturday and they later said they considered it was safe for him to be moved overseas. The doctors said Liu and his family had requested that the remainder of his care be provided in Germany or the United States. Family friend and fellow dissident Hu Jia said the ruling Communist Party would not let him die in peace.  To some extent, this was an attempt by the party to show their strength, to show that they control your life if you live in China,  he told Reuters.  But I think the historic message they are leaving is very different. By letting a Nobel peace prize winner die in custody they lost a chance to show humanity and instead proved their cold-blooded nature.  In the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, which enjoys broad freedoms not granted in mainland China, around 100 protesters gathered in silence within an hour of the news of his death being announced outside of the Beijing representative office in silence, some quietly sobbing and others with their heads. Many held signs reading  The people's hero, he'll always be remembered,   the murder of a dissident  and  free Liu Xia .  What happened to Liu Xiaobo tells the whole world about the human rights situation in China,  said pro-democracy lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung.

Target's stock has fallen about 30 percent since the start of the year, dropping to levels last seen in early 2012 due in part to what some analysts consider a confusing grocery offering and an inability to engage customers. Empty shopping carts sit inside prior to the Black Friday sale event on Thanksgiving Day at Target in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 24, 2016.Kamil KrzaczynskiIn February, the retailer vowed aggressive promotions at a meeting with investors, saying new brands and investments in technology and small stores would help it eventually win back market share.     Anand Raghuraman, principal and retail consultant at EY, said he expected volatility in retail to continue despite these optimistic second-quarter sales forecasts.  It's safe to say that investors are looking for any sign of positive news in this time of turbulence. There haven’t been many retailers that have escaped the effects of e-commerce and other emerging consumer trends recently,  Raghuraman said. Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom said Target's previous same store sales guidance might have simply been conservative, adding that other retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Costco and Dollar Tree, were still better value.  Target, which had previously forecast a low single-digit decline in comparable sales, is expected to report second-quarter results on Aug. 16.

This situation needs to change, Dr. Nick Webborn and colleagues on the medical committee of the International Paralympic Committee write in an editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. “The profile of the issue of concussion in sport has received much media attention, but none of this has considered the issues surrounding the para athlete,” Webborn, from University of Brighton’s Center for Sport and Exercise Science and Medicine in the UK, told Reuters Health.  “We face many challenges in improving the care of the head-injured para athlete. By raising awareness, we can stimulate researchers to assist us with protecting the health of these athletes,” he said by email. During the Rio Paralympic Games, there were 10 reported significant head and facial injuries, but concussion was not reported in any of them, despite  suspicious  video footage of the events, the medical committee writes.  And at the Sochi 2014 Paralympic Games, 37 percent of all sit-ski alpine athletes sustained injuries, nearly 5 percent of them to the head and neck.  In all sports, concussions often don't get reported or even recognized because of the lack of knowledge of their effect on the athlete and because athletes tend to mask symptoms to keep from being kept out of competitions, the authors note.  This summer, the medical committee will be meeting with international sports federations to highlight these issues, but outside experts need to get involved, too, to help figure out the challenges of assessing these athletes and to develop strategies to prevent concussions. Para sports were developed to level the playing field for impaired athletes. Now's the time, the committee argues, to give concussion diagnosis, treatment and prevention equal time for these athletes.  “Education is the first point in protection, and we need to improve this for both para athletes and the medical staff who may treat them,” Webborn said.

The report, written before the central bank raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday to 0.75 percent, also said the Bank of Canada's current monetary policy stance is appropriate, and it cautioned against tightening.  While the output gap has started to close, monetary policy should stay accommodative until signs of durable growth and higher inflation emerge,  it said, adding that rate hikes should be  approached cautiously.  Cheng Hoon Lim, IMF mission chief for Canada, later clarified that even with Wednesday's rate hike, monetary policy remains  appropriately accommodative.   The Bank of Canada’s increase of the policy rate reflects encouraging economic data over the past few months. We welcome the good news on the economy,  Lim said in an emailed statement.  Given the considerable uncertainty around the growth and inflation outlook, the Bank should continue to take a cautious approach in further adjusting the monetary policy stance,  she added. In a statement following its annual policy review with Canada, the IMF cautioned that risks to Canada's outlook are significant - particularly the danger of a sharp correction in the housing market, a further decline in oil prices, or U.S. protectionism. It said financial stability risks could emerge if the housing correction is accompanied by a recession, but said stress tests have shown Canadian banks could withstand a  significant loss  on their uninsured residential mortgage portfolio, in part because of high capital position. House prices in Toronto and Vancouver have more than doubled since 2009 and the boom has fueled record household debt, a vulnerability that has also been noted by the Bank of Canada.  The main risk on the domestic side is a sharp correction in the housing market that impairs bank balance sheets, triggers negative feedback loops in the economy, and increases contingent claims on the government,  the Fund said. The Fund also warned U.S. protectionism could hurt Canada, laying out a scenario for higher tariffs that could come with the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. If the United States raises the average tariff on imports from Canada by 2.1 percentage points and there is no retaliation from Canada, there would be a short-term impact on real GDP of about 0.4 percent.

The Viability Rating (VR) has been affirmed at 'b+'. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs AND SUPPORT RATING CBI's IDRs and SR are driven by institutional support from Qatar National Bank (QNB; AA-/RWN/F1). Fitch views CBI as a key affiliate of QNB and CBI is QNB's only presence in the UAE, which is considered an important market for the Qatari Group. The ratings also reflect our belief that any required support would be easily manageable for QNB given the small size of CBI relative to QNB. However, our view of potential support is somewhat constrained by QNB's minority 40% stake in CBI, which is the maximum allowed under UAE law for foreign ownership. QNB's IDRs are based on potential support available from the Qatari authorities, if necessary. In Fitch's view, this support would flow through QNB to CBI given the role it plays for QNB. A downgrade of QNB's IDRs would trigger a downgrade of CBI's IDR. When assessing CBI's IDRs, Fitch takes the view that the Qatari authorities will not place a moratorium on support towards banking subsidiaries in countries in dispute in retaliation. VR CBI's VR reflects the bank's limited franchise, a less diversified business model than peers, weak but improving asset quality metrics and weak capital ratios in light of the bank's high loan growth strategy, concentrated deposit base and below average profitability. The VR also takes into account the clean-up of CBI's balance sheet through the write-off of legacy impaired loans, acceptable management and strategy, tightened underwriting standards, albeit with a still limited track record, adequate liquidity, and the ordinary support, including liquidity support, the bank enjoys from QNB. CBI's VR primarily reflects its limited franchise (market share below 1%) and less diversified business model than its peers. It also considers ordinary support from the partnership with QNB, notably on liquidity and ability to participate in syndications and large transactions. Asset quality is weak. The impaired loans ratio is above the UAE average of 4.8%, at 9.1% at end-2016, despite the AED1.6 billion loan write off as part of the balance sheet clean-up in 2015. Reserves for impaired loans have remained well below UAE peers with coverage of 65% for impaired loans at end-2016. CBI's loan book remains concentrated, although this is a common characteristic for UAE, particularly with respect to legacy real estate assets. CBI has weaker capital ratios (the Fitch Core Capital ratio was about 11% at end-2016) than Fitch-rated UAE banks. CBI's capital ratios have been under pressure as revenue generation has not kept up with high loan growth. CBI management intends to keep the total regulatory capital ratio above 14%.  At end-2016, the Tier 1 regulatory ratio was 13.2%. The total regulatory capital ratio was 14.4%. If capital above the minimum regulatory requirement is added to loan loss reserves, then the loan loss reserve/gross loans ratio increases to 9.2% from 6.2%, giving a modest capital buffer. Fitch views CBI's funding profile as generally stable. Customer deposits are concentrated, although more than 60% are corporate-related, and have historically been stable. The 20 largest deposits accounted for 34% of the total at end-2016. CBI complements its deposit funding through a mix of short term repurchase agreements and perpetual additional Tier 1 securities demonstrating reasonable access to capital markets as well as ordinary parental support from QNB respectively. CBI has a sufficient stock of liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents, short term interbank placement and liquid securities) equivalent to 17% of deposits, providing an adequate liquidity cushion. CBI's loans to deposits ratio is in line with peers. Earnings and profitability metrics have been variable and track well below peers. Fitch's key earnings and profitability metric, operating profit/ risk weighted assets, demonstrates the variability of the bank's operating profitability, ranging from -2.9% to 1.2% over the last four years. Over the same period, UAE peers have demonstrated on average a stable 2.2% operating profit/ risk weighted assets. A combination of high loan impairment charges relative to operating profit, and an above average cost to income ratio explains why CBI's overall profitability has remained, and is likely to remain much below the industry average although this is dependent on management's ongoing actions to reduce the bank's cost base. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs AND SUPPORT RATING CBI's IDRs and SR are sensitive to a change in QNB's IDRs or a change in Fitch's view of CBI's strategic importance to its parent. In turn, QNB's IDRs are sensitive to a change in the Qatari authorities' ability or propensity to provide support if needed. In the very unlikely event that the Qatari authorities place a moratorium on support towards banking subsidiaries in countries in dispute in retaliation, extraordinary support from QNB would be discounted; CBI's IDR would then be driven by its VR and could be downgraded. VR Further evidence of CBI implementing its strategy, building its franchise, and growing its balance sheet with no material deterioration in the bank's risk indicators could contribute to an upgrade. Upside for the VR could also arise from improvements in the underlying asset quality and capital ratios. In the very unlikely event that the Qatari authorities place a moratorium on support towards banking subsidiaries in countries in dispute in retaliation, ordinary support from QNB would be discounted and CBI's VR could be downgraded.

Two days of proceedings at the Council of State is considering appeals against a government plan to curb production at the massive field by an additional 10 percent from Oct. 1. Residents want extraction at the field, which once supplied 10 percent of the European Union's gas needs, to be stopped altogether due to minor earthquakes that have damaged thousands of homes and buildings. Gas production company NAM, a joint venture between oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil, has accepted responsibility for damage caused by the quakes, for which it is paying more than 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion). However, opponents accused NAM and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which sets production levels, of underestimating the dangers.  We have consistently been lied to,  lawyer Nette Kruzenga, representing a group of Groningen residents, told the court.  The NAM is only interested in maximizing production, and the government is ignoring its task to protect people.  The Dutch government has lowered production at Groningen several times over the past three years due to small earthquakes triggered by gas extraction. The latest cap, announced in May, would lower output to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, down from 53.9 bcm in 2013. NAM said it was appealing against the cut because the decision ignored earlier agreed safety norms. The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture has said it had been put in an impossible position having been told it could continue production, vital to supply millions of Dutch homes with gas for heating and cooking, but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards.  We are on the same side as others in this case,  NAM Director Gerald Schotman said in court.  This may seem contradictory, but we have a common interest: clarity about safety.  The Ministry of Economic Affairs said production in Groningen was necessary for the gas supply in the Netherlands and parts of Germany, Belgium and France and that the earlier cuts had already diminished risks. But a relatively large number of light tremors last winter prompted more cuts.  This decision was carefully prepared and well motivated,  government lawyer Hans Besselink said.  It does justice to all parties involved.  It could take several months for a decision to be announced.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/netherlands-gas-hearing-idUSL1N1K413M"},

Its Viability Rating (VR) has been upgraded to 'bbb-' from 'bb+'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The upgrade of the Viability Rating reflects a lower risk appetite and improved asset quality. The latter follows a reduction of the bank's SME lending book to around AED1 billion from AED5.4 billion since early 2016, in addition to a significant improvement in the bank's asset quality metrics (which factor in both impaired loans and restructured loans) in the last four years. The upgrade also takes into account downwardly revised targets of loan growth and low single-borrower concentration compared with peers. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AND DEBT Mashreq's IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor reflect the extremely high probability of support available to the bank from the UAE and Abu Dhabi authorities if needed. Fitch's view of support factors in the sovereign's strong capacity to support the banking system, sustained by sovereign wealth funds and recurring revenue, mostly from hydrocarbon production, despite lower oil prices, and the moderate size of the UAE banking sector in relation to the country's GDP. Fitch also expects high willingness from the authorities to support the banking sector, which has been demonstrated by the UAE authorities' long track record of supporting domestic banks, as well as close ties with and part government ownership links to a number of banks. Mashreq's Support Rating Floor is at the UAE Domestic Systemically Important Banks's (D-SIB) Support Rating Floor of 'A', reflecting the bank's D-SIB status in the UAE and, in particular Dubai. VR The VR reflects Mashreq's improved asset quality and reduced risk appetite, resilient franchise, solid capitalisation, comfortable liquidity position, strong profitability and lower single-borrower concentration compared with peers. It also reflects sizeable concentrations in the deposit base. Mashreq's VR has historically been constrained by the bank's asset quality, with large stocks of impaired or restructured loans dating back to the financial crisis. The bank has successfully reduced these, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of gross loans. The bank's impaired loans ratio declined to 3.5% at end-2016 from 12.6% at end-2011. Over the same period, the bank's problem loans ratio (which includes impaired loans + restructured loans + 90 days past due but not impaired loans) fell to 9.7% from 28.4%. In absolute terms, impaired loans declined 55% while problem loans fell 45%. At end-2016 impaired loans were 1.4x covered by loan loss reserves, while coverage of problem loans was 53%. At the same time, given the asset quality problems encountered by the bank and the overall banking sector with SMEs, the bank has cleaned up its balance sheet from this poorly performing asset class since early 2016 and has set aside around AED0.5 billion in provisions in 2016. As a result, the SME book has been reduced to about AED1 billion and any additional losses should be minimal. New business with SME is small and has to be fully secured. Reduced risk appetite and increasing funding costs have translated into lower margins and revenue for the bank. This was supplemented in 2016 by higher loan impairment charges as the bank wrote off large amounts of SME loans. Nevertheless, Mashreq's profitability remains solid and in line with peers. Pre-provision operating profits (5.7% of gross loans) provide significant loss absorption capacity before capital gets impacted. The bank's loan book remains concentrated, albeit less than peer average, with the 20 largest names accounting for 24% of gross loans and 0.9x Fitch Core Capital (FCC) at end-2016. Concentration in customer deposits is reasonable for the region, with the top 20 deposits representing 23% of the total. At end-2016 the Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio was 16% (the FCC ratio stood at a lower 15.3%, due to the deduction of insurance net assets). The total regulatory capital ratio was 16.9%. If capital above the minimum regulatory requirement is added to loan loss reserves, then the loan loss reserve/gross loans ratio increases to 15.3% from 5.1%, which is higher than the 9.7% problem loans ratio. Mashreq has a large stock of liquid assets (cash and equivalents, short-term interbank placements and liquid securities) equivalent to 30% of assets and half of customer deposits, providing a good liquidity cushion. Mashreq's loans-to-deposits ratio is among the lowest in the UAE. Mashreq has a broad UAE-wide franchise, comprising four main business groups: retail, corporate and investment banking, treasury and capital markets, and international banking. Its market share in loans (4% at end-2016) has declined slightly due to competition from Islamic banks in Dubai and to competition in Abu Dhabi. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AND DEBT Mashreq's IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of the UAE and Abu Dhabi authorities and on their propensity to support the banking system or the bank. The senior unsecured notes issued directly by the bank are subject to the same sensitivities as the bank's IDRs. VR Mashreq's VR is sensitive to weakening asset quality affecting the bank's capital ratios. A further upgrade is unlikely given the current operating environment.

The pan-European STOXX 600  was up 0.3 percent at its close while blue-chips .STOXX50E gained 0.4 percent, with rate-sensitive real estate stocks .SX86P, which were top gainers on Wednesday, tracking more modest gains. On Wednesday, the European benchmark posted its best day since Emmanuel Macron's victory in the first round of French presidential elections, as banks and yield plays rallied.  With stocks having come off in the last few weeks, maybe investors were thinking now is the time to take the opportunity of that pullback and add some more,  said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.   Yellen's speech was a catalyst for that.  Cyclicals were back to the fore on Thursday with banks, which gain from higher rates, up 0.9 percent.   Our view remains that government bond yields will move higher, and that leaves us still favoring the less rate-sensitive parts of the stock market, cyclicals, while we're more cautious on defensives,  Bell added. Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) led the sector higher with a gain of 2.7 percent after saying that it was well on its way to reach its job reduction goals. Earnings began trickling in from a string of French companies.  Supermarket Casino (CASP.PA) jumped 3.6 percent, bolstering gains among retailers .SXRP, after its second-quarter sales growth accelerated, helped by a brightening domestic picture and a resilient performance in Brazil despite the recession there.  The beat is likely helped by good weather annualizing against a period of poor weather and strikes,  said Bernstein retail analyst Bruno Monteyne.  What's not clear at this stage is whether, like Carrefour, the sales beat at Casino will have come at the cost of higher promotions and price cuts,  he added.     Umicore (UMI.BR) jumped nearly 4 percent higher after a top-ranked analyst at ABN Amro added the Belgian chemicals group to their 'conviction list', citing capacity increases in the company's battery business, as growth prospects for the electric car industry improve.

The region is threatened with famine after the militants' eight-year insurgency to create an Islamic state, which has killed more than 20,000 people and forced some 2.7 million people to flee their homes. Many women, traditionally responsible for small livestock, have had their animals stolen or were forced to leave them behind to escape, leaving them with virtually no source of food and money for their families, aid agencies say.   Many are alone because ... men have left, been injured, disabled or even killed,  Patrick David, Nigeria country representative for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. FAO said it delivered 3,600 goats to about 900 women in the northeastern Borno state. Each received three breeding females and one male.  The  emergency distribution  targeted families hit hardest by the conflict, such as those displaced or who recently returned home in areas taken back by the Nigerian Army, the agency said in a statement.  My husband is paralyzed for last 5 years due to injuries sustained during the conflict. As an only earning member, I will keep these goats to reproduce so we can sell some of them and buy grains,  Bintu Usman, 35, was quoted as saying by the FAO. Families living in towns or villages where displaced people have sought shelter also received help, said David.  Animal restocking is crucial for the benefit of women for whom goats play a major role for the household nutrition security through the provision of milk and a source of revenue,  he said. More than 5 million people do not have enough to eat in the northeastern Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, including 50,000 living in famine-like conditions. Boko Haram has been pushed out of most of a swathe of land around the size of Belgium that it controlled in early 2015 by Nigeria's army and troops from neighboring countries. But insurgents continue to carry out suicide bombings and raids in northeast Nigeria, as well as in Cameroon and Niger. A suicide attack in Borno's capital of Maiduguri killed 17 people and injured 21 on Wednesday.

Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk were in Kiev for a 24-hour summit with Poroshenko following the final ratification of a new trade pact that has angered Russia.  What we are asking ... is to increase the fight against corruption, because corruption is undermining all the efforts this great nation is undertaking,  Juncker said at a joint briefing.  We remain very concerned.  The criticism suggests the EU delegation may have taken a tougher-than-expected line in talks forecast to be largely upbeat after the confirmation on Tuesday of an association agreement for closer political and trade ties. Separately, European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said Kiev had a shrinking window to meet 21 conditions to unlock 600 million euros ($684 million) of further financial assistance from the EU, of which seven are outstanding.  These conditions include making sure that a landmark reform forcing officials to declare their assets online is properly implemented, and Kiev lifting a ban on wood exports.   What we are emphasizing currently is that we have quite limited time,  Dombrovskis told reporters.  So all the conditions need to be implemented already in October ... because the macrofinancial assistance program ends on Jan. 4 next year.

Mykola Lazarenko/Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERSThe pro-Western government in Kiev has sought to boost EU relations since the ousting of a Moscow-backed president in 2014, implementing reforms in exchange for billions of dollars in aid and a new visa-free travel deal with the European Union. But Ukraine's allies have repeatedly expressed concern that vested interests and corrupt practices remain entrenched, partly due to weak rule of law. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund, Ukraine's main financial backer, have called for the creation of a specialized anti-corruption court, but Juncker said a new solution had been agreed at the summit. Slideshow (6 Images) Today we agreed that if Ukraine establishes ... a special chamber devoted to this issue, that will be enough,  he said. Mykhailo Zhernakov, a judicial expert at the non-governmental coalition Reanimation Package of Reforms, said the agreement would be a disappointment to those campaigning for greater accountability.  There's no way that a chamber in any court will be as independent as a separate court,  he told Reuters.  It's not going to help.  While full EU membership for Ukraine remains far off, Poroshenko stressed that Kiev hopes to integrate further by joining the customs union and becoming a member of the bloc's Schengen open-border zone.  As early as today, it's important to start developing a roadmap to the realization of our dreams,  he said.

Germany has become the first European Union country to tighten its rules on foreign corporate takeovers following a series of Chinese deals giving access to Western technology and expertise. The new regulations will allow the German government to block takeovers if there is a risk of critical technology being lost abroad. They will take effect shortly with no need for parliamentary approval. Four German firms catering to the auto industry -- FFT, Eisenmann, ZF Body Controls and Eissmann Automotive -- are currently talking to potential Chinese buyers, but do not expect political interference, the sources said.   These assets are not the type of technologically critical assets that Germany wants to protect,  a banker familiar with the deals said.  If the state were to start interfering in these kinds of deals, that would be the end of dealmaking in Germany.  FFT, a maker of manufacturing facilities for car makers owned by private equity investor Aton, has attracted first round offers from Chinese bidders such as Shanghai Electric (601727.SS) in a Morgan Stanley (MS.N)-led deal, people close to the matter said.  The company may reap a valuation of roughly half a billion euros or 8 to 9 times its expected 2017 core earnings of about 60 million euros ($68.5 million). The deal is expected to come at a lower valuation than what Midea (000333.SZ) paid for robotics maker Kuka (KU2G.DE) last year. While both groups make car production gear, FFT specializes on assembly lines but does not supply robots itself, weighing on the valuation, the people said. Family-owned paint shop maker Eisenmann has attracted two Chinese bidders, who are in the final round of a sales process organized by UBS (UBSG.S). The company, which has 70 million euros in expected 2017 core earnings may be valued at 400-500 million euros in a deal that may be signed as early as this summer, according to sources close to that deal.  ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] is also in the final stages of talks with one Chinese bidder on the sale of its $1 billion Body Controls unit, which it put on the block last year, according to sources familiar with the situation. Separately, German car interior maker Eissmann Automotive, which is being marketed by Lazard (LAZ.N), has caught the eye of a number of Chinese firms, people close to that deal said.

In the hills behind Cyprus's coastal city of Limassol, grape pickers work in average peak temperatures of 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees F) in August, a month when much of the harvest is brought in.  Researchers carrying out a small-scale study found that in the heat, labor loss rose as much as 27 percent and there was a 15 percent drop in the amount of time laborers were able to work.  If temperatures rise because of global warming, labor costs are likely to follow suit, said Andreas Flouris of the School of Exercise Science at the University of Thessaly in Greece.  I would not be surprised to see the same results being repeated in California, across southern Europe and in Australia. The environment where vines grow is more or less the same,  Flouris said, adding there is no evidence yet to confirm this for certain. Wine is one of Cyprus's main agricultural exports and is very labor intensive with vines being tended and harvested by hand.  But if vineyard owners are made aware of the problem in advance, they can offer relatively simple ways to help workers cope, Flouris told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.     Simple changes like encouraging laborers to dress in light and bright clothing which reflects the sun's radiation and does not absorb the heat as much would make a difference, said Flouris.  They tend to wear a lot more (clothing) than they should,  he said.  Other solutions include offering cold drinks and breaking up their shifts so they can rest when temperatures reach their peak each day.      The idea is to have some low-cost solutions that ... will have a major impact on the productivity of these workers.      In the study, published in the Temperature journal and is the first of its kind in Europe the researchers say, Flouris and others followed workers at four separate vineyards.  In some cases the vineyard owners themselves were not aware of the extent of the drop in productivity - maybe because they too were affected by the heat, Flouris said. Rising heat is also affecting the taste of wine in some areas.  In the Greek island of Crete, one winegrower said increasingly erratic rainfall and higher temperatures are hurting the quality of grapes on her family's estate.  Rainfall now usually lands in very short bursts in the winter, running off the soil surface so little is absorbed by the vines. And higher temperatures have shortened the growing season in some years, reducing the quality of those vintages, said Maria Tamiolaki of the Rhous winery which produces dry white, red and rose wines.       If this continues, we might need to plant vines in higher altitudes to get later maturation and less heat, and maybe choose grape varieties that take longer to mature,  she said in a telephone interview. Other vinegrowers in Crete who cannot plant higher up could irrigate their vines to help slow their growth, she said.  Most wine growers in Crete do not have irrigation systems yet so it's very difficult for them to fight very hot periods,  she said.   They need to invest in irrigation in their vines in order to fight the big heat,  she said.     Reporting by Alex Whiting @Alexwhi, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.

Tomasz Cierniak, a 32-year-old Polish national, was arrested in February 2016 in The Netherlands for hiding the Afghans behind washing machines in his truck and attempting to cross the Hook of Holland by ferry into Harwich, in southeastern England.  Cierniak pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court in England and was sentenced to three years and eight months imprisonment.  Cierniak was content to put the lives of 22 desperate people at risk. People smuggling is a callous trade and those involved think nothing of treating human beings as commodities,  said Rebecca Webb from Britain's immigration enforcement team.  As this case demonstrates, we work closely with Border Force and other criminal enforcement agencies both in the UK and abroad,  she added. Over the past two years, about 1.5 million migrants have fled fighting and poverty across the Middle East, Africa and Asia, many entrusting their lives to people smugglers who charged exorbitant prices to help them reach Europe. This has created a global business as profitable and sophisticated as drug trafficking, according to authorities who are struggling to stop the teaming up of migrants and smugglers. Europol, Europe's police agency, said people-smuggling generated up to $6 billion in 2015, but profits dropped by about a third in 2016 after a European Union (EU) deal with Turkey last March largely stemmed the migration flow.

The Viability Rating (VR) has also been affirmed at 'bb+'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AND SENIOR DEBT Rakbank's IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor reflect the high probability of support available to the bank from the UAE and Ras Al-Khaimah authorities if needed. Fitch's view of support factors in the sovereign's strong capacity to support the banking system, sustained by sovereign wealth funds and recurring revenue mostly from hydrocarbon production, despite lower oil prices, and the moderate size of the UAE banking sector in relation to the country's GDP. Fitch also expects high willingness from the authorities to support the banking sector, which has been demonstrated by the UAE authorities' long track record of supporting domestic banks, as well as close ties with and part government ownership links to a number of banks. Rakbank's Support Rating Floor is two notches below the UAE Domestic Systemically Important Banks's (D-SIB) Support Rating Floor of 'A', due to Fitch's view that Rakbank is less systematically important based on its approximate 2% market share of total assets in the UAE banking system at end-2016, and the bank's niche retail and SME focus relative to other UAE banks. The two senior unsecured notes issued under the bank's medium term note (MTN) programme through its SPV Rakfunding Cayman Limited (100%-owned subsidiary) are rated in line with the bank's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same rating drivers. VR Rakbank's VR reflects the bank's modest franchise, weakening asset quality, adequate funding and liquidity, acceptable management and strategy, healthy capital ratios and strong , albeit deteriorating, profitability. Rakbank's VR is constrained by the bank's fairly small but well-entrenched retail banking and SME Finance franchise, with limited diversification into wholesale banking, which is a growing focus for the bank. Rakbank's market share of close to 2% of both UAE banking system assets and deposits at end-2016 limits the bank's pricing power and competitive advantage. Rakbank's asset quality is weakening due to sharp deterioration in the bank's SME and Rakfinance segments. Impaired loans and problem loans ratios are high with both ratios increasing steadily over the preceding four-year period. Reserves for impaired loans have improved over the same period with a cover of 84% for impaired loans at end-2016. Rakbank is largely funded by stable customer deposits, which accounted for about 86% of total non-equity funding at end-2016. The deposit base is more granular than peers' due to its retail focus providing a stable funding base for the short- to medium-term. Rakbank complements its deposit funding with two senior unsecured issues, demonstrating good access to capital markets when required. Rakbank has a large stock of liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents, short-term interbank placement and liquid securities) equivalent to 30% of deposits, providing a good liquidity cushion. Rakbank's loans-to-deposits ratio is in line with peers'. Rakbank has stronger capital ratios (the Fitch Core Capital ratio was about 24% at end-2016) than Fitch-rated UAE banks. Strong capital levels are needed due to the bank's exposure to more volatile business segments. At end-2016, the Tier 1 regulatory ratio was 21.8%. The total regulatory capital ratio was 24%. If capital above the minimum regulatory requirement is added to loan loss reserves, then the loan loss reserve/gross loans ratio increases to 13% from 10%, giving a satisfactory capital buffer. Earnings and profitability metrics have been well above average, but have started to deteriorate. Fitch's key earnings and profitability metric, operating profit/ risk weighted assets (RWAs), has sharply declined for the bank to 2.2% from 7.3% over the preceding four years. Over the same period, UAE peers have demonstrated on average a stable 2.2% for the same metric. Rakbank's high margins have not been able to absorb underwriting losses in the bank's core lending with loan impairment charges challenging the bank's superior profitability relative to peers. With the intended further diversification into wholesale lending we expect the bank's margins to continue to reduce, reflecting the contribution of lower-risk, lower- yielding portion of wholesale lending in the bank's portfolio. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORTING RATING FLOOR AND SENIOR DEBT Rakbank's IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of the UAE and Ras al-Khaimah authorities and on their propensity to support the banking system or the bank. The two senior unsecured notes issued under the bank's MTN programme through its SPV Rakfunding Cayman Limited are rated in line Rakbank's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same sensitivities. VR The VR could be negatively affected by a further deterioration in the bank's asset quality metrics or by a weakening of the capital position due to significant write-offs. The VR could be upgraded if the bank expands its franchise and effectively diversifies its business model. The rating actions are as follows: National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F2' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BBB+' Rakfunding Cayman Limited: Guaranteed EMTN programme affirmed at 'BBB+'/'F2' Contact: Primary Analyst Redmond Ramsdale Senior Director +44 20 3530 1836 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Mark Cordwell Analyst +44 20 3530 1644 Committee Chairperson Alexander Danilov Senior Director +7 495 956 2408 Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

The report, written before the central bank raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday to 0.75 percent, also said the Bank of Canada's current monetary policy stance is appropriate, and it cautioned against tightening.  While the output gap has started to close, monetary policy should stay accommodative until signs of durable growth and higher inflation emerge,  it said, adding that rate hikes should be  approached cautiously.  Cheng Hoon Lim, IMF mission chief for Canada, later clarified that even with Wednesday's rate hike, monetary policy remains  appropriately accommodative.   The Bank of Canada’s increase of the policy rate reflects encouraging economic data over the past few months. We welcome the good news on the economy,  Lim said in an emailed statement.  Given the considerable uncertainty around the growth and inflation outlook, the Bank should continue to take a cautious approach in further adjusting the monetary policy stance,  she added. In a statement following its annual policy review with Canada, the IMF cautioned that risks to Canada's outlook are significant - particularly the danger of a sharp correction in the housing market, a further decline in oil prices, or U.S. protectionism. It said financial stability risks could emerge if the housing correction is accompanied by a recession, but said stress tests have shown Canadian banks could withstand a  significant loss  on their uninsured residential mortgage portfolio, in part because of high capital position. House prices in Toronto and Vancouver have more than doubled since 2009 and the boom has fueled record household debt, a vulnerability that has also been noted by the Bank of Canada.  The main risk on the domestic side is a sharp correction in the housing market that impairs bank balance sheets, triggers negative feedback loops in the economy, and increases contingent claims on the government,  the Fund said. The Fund also warned U.S. protectionism could hurt Canada, laying out a scenario for higher tariffs that could come with the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. If the United States raises the average tariff on imports from Canada by 2.1 percentage points and there is no retaliation from Canada, there would be a short-term impact on real GDP of about 0.4 percent.

Sterling also had a lift after Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty told The Times newspaper the central bank should consider unwinding its 435 billion pound ($562 billion) quantitative easing programme earlier than planned. Strategists expect that bounce to be short-lived. The latest guess on voting would see 2 or perhaps 3 of the 8 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members voting for a interest rate hike in August and the chances of an August hike have now dropped to 14 percent from around 25 percent last week after comments from Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent on Wednesday, ING strategists said. Broadbent said he was not yet ready to raise rates, which seemed to run contrary to warnings from other policymakers in recent weeks that rates could be lifted soon. Such remarks had pushed sterling above $1.30 at the end of June.     Investors are split on whether the BoE will raise interest rates by the end of the year, following in the footsteps of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has lifted rates twice this year, and the Bank of Canada, which increased rates on Wednesday.     The market is 50 percent priced for a hike by the end of the year – we think that overstates the risk,  said RBC Global Markets strategist Adam Cole.  Sterling was up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.2925. It is trading just above a 20-day moving average which it briefly pierced on Wednesday but analysts remain pessimistic about the near-term outlook.

The pan-European STOXX 600  was up 0.3 percent at its close while blue-chips .STOXX50E gained 0.4 percent, with rate-sensitive real estate stocks .SX86P, which were top gainers on Wednesday, tracking more modest gains. On Wednesday, the European benchmark posted its best day since Emmanuel Macron's victory in the first round of French presidential elections, as banks and yield plays rallied.  With stocks having come off in the last few weeks, maybe investors were thinking now is the time to take the opportunity of that pullback and add some more,  said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.   Yellen's speech was a catalyst for that.  Cyclicals were back to the fore on Thursday with banks, which gain from higher rates, up 0.9 percent.   Our view remains that government bond yields will move higher, and that leaves us still favoring the less rate-sensitive parts of the stock market, cyclicals, while we're more cautious on defensives,  Bell added. Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) led the sector higher with a gain of 2.7 percent after saying that it was well on its way to reach its job reduction goals. Earnings began trickling in from a string of French companies.  Supermarket Casino (CASP.PA) jumped 3.6 percent, bolstering gains among retailers .SXRP, after its second-quarter sales growth accelerated, helped by a brightening domestic picture and a resilient performance in Brazil despite the recession there.  The beat is likely helped by good weather annualizing against a period of poor weather and strikes,  said Bernstein retail analyst Bruno Monteyne.  What's not clear at this stage is whether, like Carrefour, the sales beat at Casino will have come at the cost of higher promotions and price cuts,  he added.

Anywhere it wants to. The old joke also applies to giant companies such as Saudi Aramco. The UK regulator has proposed changes that would make it easier for the state-controlled oil group to offer its shares in London. But making policy for a single company – especially one this large – is a mistake. Under the current rules, it would be almost impossible for Aramco to obtain a “premium” listing in London. For example, almost every transaction between the company and its controlling shareholder – in this case, the Saudi government – would have to be approved by independent investors. Hard to imagine a group that is effectively an arm of the state countenancing this. Aramco could choose a second-class “standard” London listing with fewer restrictions but that is hardly suitable for what may become the world’s most valuable company. So the UK Financial Conduct Authority has come up with a compromise: a new “premium” listing category especially for state-owned groups. These would be subject to all the usual rules, with three big exceptions. First, transactions with government owners would not need investor approval. Second, controlling shareholders would face fewer legal restrictions, such as the requirement that independent directors be vetted by external investors. Third, the category would be open for companies that have a primary listing elsewhere. The workaround at least ensures Aramco would not be part of the FTSE 100 Index – one of the main objections to the proposed listing. Indeed, one interpretation is that the FCA is creating a category for Aramco that offers few of the benefits of a full London listing but sounds better than the other options. Yet UK investors who decided to buy Aramco shares would face greater risks, and enjoy fewer protections, than with other large companies. It’s striking that a regulator that has spent years holding investors’ hands should conclude that, in this case, they are able to look after themselves. Attracting Aramco would be a big endorsement of UK capital markets as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. That’s something the FCA, which is required to keep markets clean while also ensuring that London remains competitive, cannot ignore. Nevertheless, a willingness to opportunistically stretch the rules does not bode well for post-Brexit regulation.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Sterling also had a lift after Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty told The Times newspaper the central bank should consider unwinding its 435 billion pound ($562 billion) quantitative easing programme earlier than planned. Strategists expect that bounce to be short-lived. The latest guess on voting would see 2 or perhaps 3 of the 8 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members voting for a interest rate hike in August and the chances of an August hike have now dropped to 14 percent from around 25 percent last week after comments from Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent on Wednesday, ING strategists said. Broadbent said he was not yet ready to raise rates, which seemed to run contrary to warnings from other policymakers in recent weeks that rates could be lifted soon. Such remarks had pushed sterling above $1.30 at the end of June.     Investors are split on whether the BoE will raise interest rates by the end of the year, following in the footsteps of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has lifted rates twice this year, and the Bank of Canada, which increased rates on Wednesday.     The market is 50 percent priced for a hike by the end of the year – we think that overstates the risk,  said RBC Global Markets strategist Adam Cole.  Sterling was up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.2925. It is trading just above a 20-day moving average which it briefly pierced on Wednesday but analysts remain pessimistic about the near-term outlook.  With Brexit uncertainty deteriorating economic fundamentals and political risk all weighing heavily on the British pound, further downside may be on the cards,  said FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga.  Against the euro, it was trading at 88.09 pence, after hitting a eight-month low against the single currency in the previous session.

Two days of proceedings at the Council of State is considering appeals against a government plan to curb production at the massive field by an additional 10 percent from Oct. 1.  Residents want extraction at the field, which once supplied 10 percent of the European Union's gas needs, to be stopped altogether due to minor earthquakes that have damaged thousands of homes and buildings. Gas production company NAM, a joint venture between oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), has accepted responsibility for damage caused by the quakes, for which it is paying more than 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion). However, opponents accused NAM and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which sets production levels, of underestimating the dangers.  We have consistently been lied to,  lawyer Nette Kruzenga, representing a group of Groningen residents, told the court.  The NAM is only interested in maximizing production, and the government is ignoring its task to protect people.  The Dutch government has lowered production at Groningen several times over the past three years due to small earthquakes triggered by gas extraction. The latest cap, announced in May, would lower output to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, down from 53.9 bcm in 2013. NAM said it was appealing against the cut because the decision ignored earlier agreed safety norms. The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture has said it had been put in an impossible position having been told it could continue production, vital to supply millions of Dutch homes with gas for heating and cooking, but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards.  We are on the same side as others in this case,  NAM Director Gerald Schotman said in court.  This may seem contradictory, but we have a common interest: clarity about safety.  The Ministry of Economic Affairs said production in Groningen was necessary for the gas supply in the Netherlands and parts of Germany, Belgium and France and that the earlier cuts had already diminished risks. But a relatively large number of light tremors last winter prompted more cuts.  This decision was carefully prepared and well motivated,  government lawyer Hans Besselink said.  It does justice to all parties involved.      It could take several months for a decision to be announced.

Ankara has said it will take measures against Cyprus for engaging in gas and oil exploration around the island. It says that hydrocarbon resources in the waters around the divided island should belong to both sides. The military said it had deployed the frigates and a submarine to the eastern Mediterranean to  guarantee the security of oil transportation .  Another frigate was dispatched to monitor a drilling vessel off the coast of Cyprus, it said.

However, Sessions has said he met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A large portion of the document was left blank. “As a United States Senator, the Attorney General met hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign dignitaries and their staff.

Sessions recused himself from the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the election after media reports revealed he held undisclosed meetings with Kislyak. Sessions admitted to having the interactions, but said they were held in his capacity as a U.S. senator, a position he occupied for 20 years before becoming attorney general.

Investor groups had raised concerns about pay both for creative director and former chief executive Christopher Bailey and for Brown ahead of the annual general meeting, the first for new chief executive Marco Gobbetti. In the event Burberry saw off a revolt on the scale it suffered in 2014, when a majority of shareholders voted against Bailey's pay. Some 68.5 percent of shares voted approved its executive remuneration report on Thursday. Management pay has become a hot topic in Britain in recent years, with many Britons angry at excessive payouts, but investors have had little public success in cutting packages. Burberry's chairman John Peace said the board's objective was to do what was right for both shareholders and the business.  We are very social minded about public attitudes right now in the UK and we try to be good citizens in that context as well. We strike a balance,  he told the meeting.  But if we don't have the best people, the team capable of driving this business forward in the future, I don't think shareholders would want that either.  Investors' advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had recommended shareholders oppose the remuneration report. Bailey received 3.5 million pounds in pay and exceptional awards in the year to end-March, according to the company's annual report, although he waived a bonus. Meanwhile Brown, who took over as chief operating and financial officer in January, received 4.734 million pounds in pay and share awards in the year ended March 31, with more than 4.5 million coming in compensation for missing out on share option awards made by her previous employer Smith & Nephew . She later handed back options worth as much as 2.4 million pounds.  She took a decision because she felt it was in the interests of Burberry and herself to address those concerns expressed by the agency (ISS),  Peace said after the meeting.  She didn't have to do it but she did it because she felt it was the right thing to do.  The meeting gave investors a first opportunity to hear from Gobbetti, who joined from French fashion house Celine earlier in the year before taking over as chief executive this month. He said he had established a good working relationship with Bailey, who remains the creative driving force behind the brand.  Of course we each have our own responsibilities but the dialogue is constant. Christopher is one of the reasons I came to this company,  he told reporters.  We have great understanding, we share the same vision and the same values.  Gobbetti has also started with some good news, with the company reporting better than expected sales in the three months ended June 30, helped by a rebound in Chinese demand and another good performance in its home British market.

In the hills behind Cyprus's coastal city of Limassol, grape pickers work in average peak temperatures of 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees F) in August, a month when much of the harvest is brought in.  Researchers carrying out a small-scale study found that in the heat, labor loss rose as much as 27 percent and there was a 15 percent drop in the amount of time laborers were able to work.  If temperatures rise because of global warming, labor costs are likely to follow suit, said Andreas Flouris of the School of Exercise Science at the University of Thessaly in Greece.  I would not be surprised to see the same results being repeated in California, across southern Europe and in Australia. The environment where vines grow is more or less the same,  Flouris said, adding there is no evidence yet to confirm this for certain. Wine is one of Cyprus's main agricultural exports and is very labor intensive with vines being tended and harvested by hand.  But if vineyard owners are made aware of the problem in advance, they can offer relatively simple ways to help workers cope, Flouris told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.     Simple changes like encouraging laborers to dress in light and bright clothing which reflects the sun's radiation and does not absorb the heat as much would make a difference, said Flouris.  They tend to wear a lot more (clothing) than they should,  he said.  Other solutions include offering cold drinks and breaking up their shifts so they can rest when temperatures reach their peak each day.      The idea is to have some low-cost solutions that ... will have a major impact on the productivity of these workers.      In the study, published in the Temperature journal and is the first of its kind in Europe the researchers say, Flouris and others followed workers at four separate vineyards.  In some cases the vineyard owners themselves were not aware of the extent of the drop in productivity - maybe because they too were affected by the heat, Flouris said. Rising heat is also affecting the taste of wine in some areas.  In the Greek island of Crete, one winegrower said increasingly erratic rainfall and higher temperatures are hurting the quality of grapes on her family's estate.  Rainfall now usually lands in very short bursts in the winter, running off the soil surface so little is absorbed by the vines. And higher temperatures have shortened the growing season in some years, reducing the quality of those vintages, said Maria Tamiolaki of the Rhous winery which produces dry white, red and rose wines.       If this continues, we might need to plant vines in higher altitudes to get later maturation and less heat, and maybe choose grape varieties that take longer to mature,  she said in a telephone interview. Other vinegrowers in Crete who cannot plant higher up could irrigate their vines to help slow their growth, she said.  Most wine growers in Crete do not have irrigation systems yet so it's very difficult for them to fight very hot periods,  she said.   They need to invest in irrigation in their vines in order to fight the big heat,  she said.     Reporting by Alex Whiting @Alexwhi, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.

In a detailed study analyzing more than half the genes in the genome of the parasite that cause malaria - Plasmodium -  researchers found that two thirds of those genes are essential for survival. This is the largest proportion of essential genes found in any organism studied to date, they said. Importantly for researchers trying to develop vaccines and drugs against the disease, the scientists discovered that the parasite often disposes of genes that produce proteins that give its presence away to its host's immune system.  This allows malaria to swiftly change its appearance to the human immune system and hence build up resistance to a vaccine, posing problems for the development of effective shots.  Our study found that below the surface the parasite is more of a Formula 1 race car than a clunky people carrier: The parasite is fine-tuned and retains the absolute essential genes needed for growth,  said Julian Rayner, who co-led this study at Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. He said this discovery, published on Thursday in the journal Cell, had both positive and negative implications.  The bad news is it can easily get rid of the genes behind the targets we are trying to design vaccines for, but the flip side is there are many more essential gene targets for new drugs than we previously thought,  he said. Malaria kills around half a million people a year, the vast majority of them children and babies in the poorest parts of sub-Saharan Africa. And beyond that, almost half the world's population is at risk of becoming infected with malaria and more than 200 million people fall sick with it each year, according to World Health Organization figures.  Despite decades of scientific endeavor, the genetics of Plasmodium parasites have proved tricky to decipher.  This is partly because they are ancient organisms and around half their genes have no similar genes – homologs – in any other organism, Rayner's team explained, making it difficult for scientists to find clues to their function.  Francisco Javier Gamo, a malaria expert at GlaxoSmithKline, a British drugmaker active in this field of research, said the  Holy Grail  for malaria scientists would be to discover genes that are essential across all of the parasite lifecycle stages.  If we could target those with drugs it would leave malaria with nowhere to hide,  he said.

Oil prices gained as evidence of stronger demand in China offset reports of higher production by key OPEC exporters in a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Stocks on Wall Street climbed, ahead of Yellen's second day of testimony after her remarks on Wednesday suggested a more gradual tightening of monetary policy than expected, which sparked a rally in global equity markets. The U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, though low inflation may leave the central bank with less leeway, Yellen told a House committee on Wednesday. Sentiment was boosted after China reported upbeat data on exports and imports for June, the latest sign that global trade is finding some traction again. The data pushed Asian shares up more than 1 percent and lifted MSCI's 47-country gauge of global equity markets to a fresh record high with a gain of 0.25 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.27 percent to close at a preliminary 1,518.69. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 18.24 points, or 0.08 percent, to 21,550.38. The S&P; 500 gained 2.82 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,446.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.29 points, or 0.04 percent, to 6,263.46. Oil Gains Encouraging U.S. economic data supported the dollar. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week for the first time in a month and producer prices unexpectedly rose in June. The data likely will keep the Fed on track for a third interest rate increase this year.  We are seeing the dollar do a little bit better this morning, particularly following the producer price index figure,  said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York.  Yesterday, Yellen's comments were perceived as more dovish by the market,  she said. Yellen returned to Capitol Hill on Thursday to testify before the Senate Banking Committee and investors are also focused on U.S. consumer price index numbers due out on Friday. Oil prices rose after dropping in recent weeks to levels not seen since the end of last year as investors lost faith in a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers to reduce output. U.S. shale oil production also has risen sharply. Brent crude was up 71 cents to $48.45 a barrel. U.S. light crude was 69 cents higher at $46.18. U.S. Treasury yields rose after falling for three straight days, tracking gains in German bond yields with solid U.S. economic data supporting their trend higher. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.3569 percent. The German 10-year Bund was up 2 basis points to 0.533 percent.

Retailers and BT made gains but the FTSE 100 ended the session 0.1 percent lower at 7,413.44 points, lagging Europe's 0.4 percent rise. Troubled construction services company Carillion, which has seen 70 percent of its market value wiped out since a profit warning and the exit of its CEO on Monday, slipped another 3.1 percent in choppy trading as JPMorgan slashed its  overweight  rating to  neutral . Investors shunned AstraZeneca shares, which slid 3.4 percent to the bottom of the FTSE after a media report said Chief Executive Pascal Soriot could be preparing to defect to Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. The company declined to deny the report. Some analysts questioned whether reports of a move suggested the results of the company's MYSTIC trial of a lung cancer candidate could fail - although others said they saw no link.  We find it hard to believe a Soriot departure would have direct read-across to (key lung cancer trial) Mystic, and would favour remuneration and the UK mood music as at least a key part of the explanation,  said Liberum analyst Roger Franklin.  Any significant fall today could therefore be a buying opportunity for long-term investors,  he added. BT led blue-chip gainers and Europe's telecoms sector , up 4 percent after UK broker Numis started covering the company with a  buy  rating.  Earlier this year the company and (regulator) Ofcom gave many BT shareholders much heartache, but at current levels we believe the share price discounts some incredible assumptions,  Numis analysts wrote. Retailers Marks & Spencer and Next made solid gains, as investors read across from stronger results reported by French supermarket Casino, lifting retailers across Europe. N Brown slid 6.5 percent, the worst mid-cap faller, after the plus-size fashion retailer said it would incur an exceptional charge of up to 40 million pounds ($52 million) for potential customer redress on flaws in products sold between 2006 and 2014. Ocado gained 2.4 percent, however, after Credit Suisse raised its target price on the stock, predicting the online grocer would expand margins through automation.  Whereas we think the market has tended to view Ocado's latest-generation facility as the endpoint of the investment case, we believe this platform will allow Ocado to drive widespread automation and monetise its intellectual property,  analysts at the Swiss bank wrote.

Power utility Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA wants to be part of a Brookfield-led turnaround of Renova, two of the people said. The utility known as Cemig (CMIG4.SA) owns 34.2 percent of Renova. That stance could sink Brookfield's proposed 1.6 billion-real ($499 million) cash offer for control of Renova, the people said. Cemig plans to first sound out interest from distressed debt giant Oaktree Capital Management LP and two other unidentified funds in Renova, two of the people said. Reuters reported on Friday that Canada-based Brookfield would buy out the combined 63.5 percent that Cemig, Light SA (LIGT3.SA) and RR Participações SA have in Renova for 810 million reais. The Canadian firm would then pump an additional 800 million reais into Renova to win full management rights. Cemig, Light and Brookfield declined to comment.  Snubbing Brookfield, which has made a number of high-profile infrastructure and energy takeovers in Brazil in the past year, is  risky for Renova since it faces a heavy repayment calendar and a fragile cash position,  said one of the people, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Renova's units (RNEW11.SA), the company's most widely traded class of stock, extended losses on Thursday on the news. The stock shed 2.3 percent to 7.58 reais, compared with a 0.5 percent gain in Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index. Cash Crunch Units are up almost 30 percent since Jan. 2, on expectations a takeover could save the company from a chronic cash shortage or even bankruptcy. Reuters first reported that Renova could be taken over on March 1. Renova has struggled with a severe cash crunch over the past couple of years. Financing conditions for Renova, which was founded in 2001, worsened significantly when a partnership with SunEdison Inc collapsed weeks before the latter filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. Exiting Renova would allow Cemig, Brazil's No. 3 power utility, to facilitate the refinancing of almost 5 billion reais of debt maturing this year. This week, Chief Financial Officer Adezio Lima said the partial or full sale of Cemig's and Light's stakes in Renova could take up to 60 days.

Power utility Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA wants to be part of a Brookfield-led turnaround of Renova, two of the people said. The utility known as Cemig (CMIG4.SA) owns 34.2 percent of Renova. That stance could sink Brookfield's proposed 1.6 billion-real ($499 million) cash offer for control of Renova, the people said. Cemig plans to first sound out interest from distressed debt giant Oaktree Capital Management LP and two other unidentified funds in Renova, two of the people said. Reuters reported on Friday that Canada-based Brookfield would buy out the combined 63.5 percent that Cemig, Light SA (LIGT3.SA) and RR Participações SA have in Renova for 810 million reais. The Canadian firm would then pump an additional 800 million reais into Renova to win full management rights. Cemig, Light and Brookfield declined to comment.  Snubbing Brookfield, which has made a number of high-profile infrastructure and energy takeovers in Brazil in the past year, is  risky for Renova since it faces a heavy repayment calendar and a fragile cash position,  said one of the people, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Renova's units (RNEW11.SA), the company's most widely traded class of stock, extended losses on Thursday on the news. The stock shed 2.3 percent to 7.58 reais, compared with a 0.5 percent gain in Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index. Cash Crunch Units are up almost 30 percent since Jan. 2, on expectations a takeover could save the company from a chronic cash shortage or even bankruptcy. Reuters first reported that Renova could be taken over on March 1. Renova has struggled with a severe cash crunch over the past couple of years. Financing conditions for Renova, which was founded in 2001, worsened significantly when a partnership with SunEdison Inc collapsed weeks before the latter filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. Exiting Renova would allow Cemig, Brazil's No. 3 power utility, to facilitate the refinancing of almost 5 billion reais of debt maturing this year. This week, Chief Financial Officer Adezio Lima said the partial or full sale of Cemig's and Light's stakes in Renova could take up to 60 days. Interest in Brazil's renewable power industry is growing, especially among foreign investors who see it as a resilient play despite declining electricity consumption and a harsh recession.

By Mica Rosenberg NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of asylum seekers fleeing gang and drug violence in Honduras and Mexico were improperly turned away at the U.S.-Mexico border by border patrol agents, a lawsuit filed against the U.S. government on Wednesday said. The lawsuit said some U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have referred to the tough immigration policies of President Donald Trump when turning asylum seekers back. But it also said human rights groups have documented  hundreds  of cases dating back to at least the summer of 2016, before Trump's election win in November. The American Immigration Council and other groups filed the lawsuit on behalf of a non-profit legal services group called  Al Otro Lado  and six unidentified people in U.S. District Court in central California, the class action lawsuit said border agents have used  misrepresentations, threats and intimidation,  to tell asylum seekers they cannot enter the country at various border crossings in California, Arizona and Texas. The accounts of the plaintiffs detailed in the lawsuit could not be independently verified. U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. Under U.S. immigration law, if someone arriving at a U.S. port of entry expresses fear of returning to their country, border agents should refer them to an interview with a designated asylum officer.    The lawsuit detailed the case of a woman from Mexico whose brother-in-law was a high-ranking police official killed and dismembered by a drug cartel in Mexico, which then threatened her family. When she arrived with her children at the San Ysidro, California, port of entry and said she was afraid to go back, a border officer coerced her into signing a form in English that she did not understand withdrawing her application for admission to the United States, the lawsuit said.  Apprehensions of immigrants on the southwest border have dropped since the beginning of the Trump administration in January, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics. Apprehensions are down more than 67 percent to more than 21,000 in June of 2017 from more than 66,000 in October.

Tomasz Cierniak, a 32-year-old Polish national, was arrested in February 2016 in The Netherlands for hiding the Afghans behind washing machines in his truck and attempting to cross the Hook of Holland by ferry into Harwich, in southeastern England.  Cierniak pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court in England and was sentenced to three years and eight months imprisonment.  Cierniak was content to put the lives of 22 desperate people at risk. People smuggling is a callous trade and those involved think nothing of treating human beings as commodities,  said Rebecca Webb from Britain's immigration enforcement team.  As this case demonstrates, we work closely with Border Force and other criminal enforcement agencies both in the UK and abroad,  she added. Over the past two years, about 1.5 million migrants have fled fighting and poverty across the Middle East, Africa and Asia, many entrusting their lives to people smugglers who charged exorbitant prices to help them reach Europe. This has created a global business as profitable and sophisticated as drug trafficking, according to authorities who are struggling to stop the teaming up of migrants and smugglers. Europol, Europe's police agency, said people-smuggling generated up to $6 billion in 2015, but profits dropped by about a third in 2016 after a European Union (EU) deal with Turkey last March largely stemmed the migration flow.

According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, the European Central Bank will signal a tweak to its policy outlook at the Sept. 7 meeting.  This is another story that suggests the ECB is going to prepare markets in the autumn for a tapering,  said Rabobank fixed income strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor.  We still think this is more likely to come in October but the market is reading it as sign that QE is going to come to an end, and so pushing bond yields higher.  Bonds across the euro zone came under fresh selling pressure after the report, with German Bund yields coming off a one-week low hit earlier in the session and then turning higher on the day. Near the close, it was up 2 basis points to 0.53 percent . Earlier on Thursday, yields had dropped in a reaction to U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's comments on Wednesday that the Fed would not need to raise rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the neutral fed funds rate. But in Europe, expectations have ramped up that extraordinary monetary stimulus will end sooner rather than later, given impetus by a June 27 speech by ECB chief Mario Draghi in which he opened the door for policy tweaks. This has prompted many investors to shed their holdings of euro zone government bonds, and yields have shot up in the past two weeks.  We have a short position in German bunds as they look the most expensive along with Japanese bonds. Should market volatility rise, bond yields will rise faster than what most investors are positioned for,  said James McAlevey, a fixed income portfolio manager at Aviva Investors.

But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan also said prosecutors had  sufficient  evidence to prove the honest services fraud, extortion and money laundering counts on which Silver was convicted in November 2015, and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said his office plans to retry Silver, 73, who has been free on bail.  We look forward to presenting to another jury the evidence of decades-long corruption by one of the most powerful politicians in New York State history,  Kim said. Steven Molo and Joel Cohen, lawyers for Silver, said in a statement:  We are grateful the court saw it our way and reversed the conviction.  Silver, a Democrat, represented Manhattan's Lower East Side, and was Assembly speaker from 1994 to 2015. Along with Governor Andrew Cuomo and former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, he was one of the  three men in a room  with effective power to dictate New York legislative priorities. Prosecutors accused Silver of collecting close to $4 million of illegal fees for awarding state grants to a top cancer researcher, and steering real estate developers to a friend's law firm and supporting their interests on rent legislation.

In Thursday's decision, Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes said that ruling tainted the instructions that Silver's jury received from U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni, through no fault of her own or prosecutors. Cabranes said this made it unclear beyond a reasonable doubt that Silver would otherwise have been convicted, though  many would view the facts adduced at Silver's trial with distaste.  Kim said a retrial would likely provide  the justice that New Yorkers got upon Silver's conviction.  Skelos, a Republican, and his son Adam are awaiting the appeals court's decision on whether to overturn their own corruption convictions. Silver's and Dean Skelos' convictions were among the biggest prosecutions by Kim's predecessor, Preet Bharara, who made fighting public corruption a priority.

The move to develop a new warplane accelerates steps that are expected to shape the future of the European fighter industry and its three existing programs - the Eurofighter, France's Rafale and Sweden's Gripen. The move also reflects efforts to give fresh impetus to Franco-German relations in the aftermath of Britain's decision to leave the European Union and was described by defense experts as a snub to Europe's leading military power.. France and Germany aim to come up with a roadmap by mid 2018 for jointly leading development of the new aircraft to replace their existing fleets of rival warplanes, according to a document issued after a Franco-German cabinet meeting in Paris.  Today there are too many European standards and qualifications and sometimes there is competition among Europeans internationally,  French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference, flanked by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  I can confirm this is a deep revolution but we are not afraid when they are carried out peacefully, in a structured way and over time,  Macron said. France and Germany said their new combat system, which analysts say could involve a mixture of manned and unmanned aircraft, would replace the Rafale and Eurofighter, rival jets that compete fiercely for global sales. That would mark the end of a decades-long split since France withdrew from the Eurofighter project in the 1980s to produce its Rafale warplane with Dassault Aviation. Defense industry experts called the move a setback to Britain and its leading arms contractor, BAE Systems.  It is a sign to the British. It means 'you are leaving the EU and we are driving forward. We are no longer interested in you blocking the EU on defense',  a senior German defense industry official told Reuters. French President Emmanuel Macron arrives with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to attend a Franco-German joint cabinet meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, July 13, 2017.Stephane MaheBritain Out on a Limb? The joint declaration did not say what role, if any, Britain would play in the Franco-German-led development. The country is Europe's biggest defense spender and a partner in the Eurofighter project alongside Germany, Spain and Italy. France and the United Kingdom - both permanent U.N. Security Council members with close defense and security ties - agreed to cooperate on nuclear and missiles technology in 2010, but some French officials have expressed concerns about the impact of Brexit on defense. Some analysts and defense officials said the Franco-German push to create a new fighter could drive Britain further toward industrial and defense cooperation with the United States. Currently, Britain has a foot in both camps through the Lockheed Martin F-35 and a share of the Eurofighter program through BAE.  It is almost inevitable that the UK would consider a new partnership with America for the next generation of fighters,  said Alexandra Ashbourne-Walmsley, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank based in London.  The UK has accepted that it can't build another fighter on its own, both as a natural evolution from the F-35 program and also because of economies of scale since having a small part of a U.S. project is worth more than a Franco-German program.  However, Thursday's declaration is also seen by some as just the opening move in a long and unpredictable European negotiation affecting defense firms including BAE and its Eurofighter partners Airbus and Leonardo. Paris and Berlin also agreed to set up a cooperation framework for the next model of the Airbus Tiger attack helicopter and for tactical air-to-ground missiles.  In addition, they will work together on procuring ground systems including heavy tanks and artillery and said a contract was expected to be signed before 2019 for the military  Eurodrone  project, which also includes Italy.

Two days of proceedings at the Council of State is considering appeals against a government plan to curb production at the massive field by an additional 10 percent from Oct. 1.  Residents want extraction at the field, which once supplied 10 percent of the European Union's gas needs, to be stopped altogether due to minor earthquakes that have damaged thousands of homes and buildings. Gas production company NAM, a joint venture between oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), has accepted responsibility for damage caused by the quakes, for which it is paying more than 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion). However, opponents accused NAM and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which sets production levels, of underestimating the dangers.  We have consistently been lied to,  lawyer Nette Kruzenga, representing a group of Groningen residents, told the court.  The NAM is only interested in maximizing production, and the government is ignoring its task to protect people.  The Dutch government has lowered production at Groningen several times over the past three years due to small earthquakes triggered by gas extraction. The latest cap, announced in May, would lower output to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, down from 53.9 bcm in 2013. NAM said it was appealing against the cut because the decision ignored earlier agreed safety norms. The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture has said it had been put in an impossible position having been told it could continue production, vital to supply millions of Dutch homes with gas for heating and cooking, but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards.  We are on the same side as others in this case,  NAM Director Gerald Schotman said in court.  This may seem contradictory, but we have a common interest: clarity about safety.  The Ministry of Economic Affairs said production in Groningen was necessary for the gas supply in the Netherlands and parts of Germany, Belgium and France and that the earlier cuts had already diminished risks. But a relatively large number of light tremors last winter prompted more cuts.  This decision was carefully prepared and well motivated,  government lawyer Hans Besselink said.  It does justice to all parties involved.      It could take several months for a decision to be announced.

Navalny, a 41-year-old lawyer who has organized the biggest anti-Kremlin protests in years, hopes to run against Putin in a presidential election in March and told Reuters he planned to call for more big anti-government demonstrations.  My mood is generally really positive,  said Navalny.  I have 125,000 volunteers, people turn out to demonstrate, they are detained, campaign literature is confiscated. (But) I see that people support us.       Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for the last 17 years and remains highly popular according to opinion polls, has yet to confirm whether he will run for what would be a fourth term, but is widely expected to do so - and to win.  I constantly hear that it's impossible to change anything and that there is this 86 percent (which supports Putin). But I don't see this 86 percent,  Navalny said in an interview in his office overlooking a gray Moscow suburb.  In an authoritarian country, such a number is not relevant. There will be an election campaign, people will see an alternative, and this 86 percent will crumble.  Previous opposition contenders have struggled to get their message across in a tightly-controlled media landscape where state TV hews closely to the Kremlin line and either ignores or denigrates rivals. They faced a particular challenge in areas of the vast Russian Federation far from Moscow and St Petersburg. Navalny, who has used the Internet to try to tap into public anger over official corruption, is battling to even be allowed to take part in the election after the Central Election Commission said a suspended conviction for embezzlement he describes as politically-motivated disqualified him. He has been jailed twice in recent months for his role in organizing anti-government protests, had a caustic liquid thrown in his eyes by an assailant, and investigators have raided his Moscow election headquarters. Police have also confiscated copies of his campaign newspaper and hundreds of his supporters have been detained at protests and election events.  How many times can you be afraid?  quipped Navalny, whose sprawling offices inside a business center buzz with young people working on laptops, as well as allies broadcasting from a small studio to his online TV channel.  The Kremlin's strategy is to prevent our activities. That's because the only reason for Putin's support is because nobody else is carrying out any other (political) activity.     His investigations into the high-rolling lifestyles of top government officials have riled the authorities and Navalny says his own family is now under constant pressure. Navalny has a 9-year-old boy and a 15-year-old daughter.  The security services are following us,  said Navalny.  They follow my children, my wife and me. Cars are constantly passing by. I don't even pay attention to it any more, but Yulia (his wife) is really bothered by it.   Some opposition activists left the country after opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was shot dead near the Kremlin walls in 2015. Oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested on fraud charges in 2003, after expressing political ambitions, and imprisoned until 2013 when he was allowed to go abroad. Since being temporarily blinded in one eye in the caustic liquid attack, Navalny sometimes appears with a bodyguard. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny speaks during an interview with Reuters in Moscow, Russia, July 12, 2017. Picture taken July 12, 2017.Grigory DukorThe FSB security service did not immediately respond to a  request for comment.  Critics Among Navalny's pledges: To depoliticize the judiciary, to champion a free media, to promote free market economics, to legalize personal handguns and to introduce a visa regime for visitors from Central Asia and the South Caucasus.  He told Reuters he would be willing to organize  an honest referendum  in Crimea which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 to see which country its residents wanted to be part of. The way Moscow had seized it, he said, was illegal. But he also said he thought the Crimea problem, which has soured relations with the West and triggered sanctions against the Kremlin, looked  intractable  and could poison relations for years ahead. Slideshow (4 Images)Critics have accused him of harboring dangerous nationalist tendencies with one fellow activist suggesting he was a Kremlin stooge designed to create the illusion of political competition. Navalny says he has no time for such  ridiculous  conspiracy theories and that his immigration policies are in line with  normal  European practice.              Dressed casually in jeans and a white shirt, Navalny said he was certain the authorities would relent and allow him to run in next year's election.  I have no doubt I will take part in the election and that we will achieve our goal,  he said.  One opinion poll earlier this year put his support as low as 1 percent. Navalny, however, points to the Moscow mayoral election in 2013 when he came from a low base to place second with almost one third of the vote.      He said he was using 125,000 volunteers and 60 election offices across Russia in a campaign designed to force authorities to allow him to run.  If he were barred from the election, he said, the ballot could not be regarded as fair.  He said he would deploy an army of volunteers as poll observers to ensure the 2018 vote was fair. Top officials right up to President Putin are careful never to mention Navalny's name in public, even when asked direct questions about him.  Putin, when asked at the G20 in Hamburg earlier this month why he refused to pronounce Navalny's name publicly, said he wasn't interested in a dialogue with people out to promote themselves and again didn't mention Navalny by name.  I understand the rules of the political games pretty well and what they (the Kremlin) do and what I must do,  Navalny said.  We are conducting a real campaign which nobody else is doing. We are changing the political landscape.  Editing by Ralph Boulton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-idUSKBN19Y1YI"},

The Financial Conduct Authority's proposals on Thursday would create a new listing category for companies controlled by sovereign states and come as exchanges vie to win the Aramco initial public offering, which is set to be the largest ever.  But they met with criticism from British fund managers, who have already expressed concerns about Aramco's governance.  Investors believe a premium listed segment without these investor protections is not a premium segment and will not provide the protections that investors expect,  Chris Cummings, chief executive at the Investment Association said.  Reuters reported earlier this year that the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) was working on a new type of structure that would make the bourse more attractive for Aramco.  No decision has been made on the venue yet,  a source close to Aramco told Reuters following Thursday's proposals, which come as the government and City of London are trying to keep Britain's financial markets attractive to international investors and companies after it leaves the European Union. The FCA is proposing a new  premium  stock market listing category that will exempt companies controlled by sovereign states from certain requirements and also be available to companies listed in London using depositary receipts, financial instruments used to represent a foreign company's shares.  Companies including Russian state firms Gazprom (GZPRI.MM) and Rosneft (ROSN.MM) use depositary receipts on the LSE.   Related CoverageUK fund trade body says listing rule changes could hurt investor protection Refining the listing regime in this way would make UK markets more accessible whilst ensuring that the protections afforded by our premium listing regime are focused and proportionate,  FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said. But Ashley Hamilton Claxton, Corporate Governance Manager at Royal London Asset Management said this may reverse progress made on governance and protecting minority shareholders.   It looks like the FCA is consulting on amending the existing listing rules to accommodate the peculiarities of one company, which is not a very effective strategy for regulating the market as a whole,  Hamilton Claxton said.  The London Stock Exchange has made winning the listing of Aramco a priority, with the firm's chief executive Xavier Rolet joining Prime Minister Theresa May on a trip to Saudi Arabia in April. The pair met jointly with the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, which will play a major role in the listing decision.  FILE PHOTO: Oil tanks seen at the Saudi Aramco headquarters during a media tour at Damam city November 11, 2007.Ali Jarekji/File PhotoThe FCA's Bailey told Reuters he had not discussed the proposal with the government.   It was not instigated by the government or the LSE which we regulate,  he said. The New York Stock Exchange, which is also competing for the Aramco listing, has not offered any such regulatory changes, a source familiar with talks between NYSE and Aramco said.  However, it already has certain features that would attract Aramco, including not setting any minimum requirement for the proportion of a company's stock that has to be listed.  London usually requires a  free float  of at least a quarter of a company's shares, although under the proposals a sovereign-backed company could circumvent this if it issued depository receipts representing a small proportion of the overall firm.  Bridging the Gulf Under the plans, sovereign-controlled companies will be able to get a  premium  listing without complying with certain rules on related party transactions and controlling shareholders. The changes are likely to make London more attractive to state-controlled companies as several Gulf countries, including Oman and Abu Dhabi, are considering listing oil assets.  This is a clever solution to the dilemma of Aramco, which does not meet the general requirements regarding free-float and corporate governance,  Edward Bibko, head of capital markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa at law firm Baker McKenzie, said.  At present companies which do not meet Britain's  premium  listing requirements must take a standard listing which is seen as second best as it has lower corporate governance requirements and does not qualify for entry into most stock indices. The FCA said sovereign owners were different  in both their motivations and their nature  from private ones so it was legitimate to grant them an exemption from some of the requirements for private companies.    We believe that investors and the market are sufficiently able to assess the additional risks arising from sovereign ownership,  it said in the consultation document.  The FCA has set a deadline of Oct 13 for comment on the proposals, which are part of a wider review it is undertaking into Britain's listing rules but were brought forward because it said it thought there was a gap in its current rules.

The 27-year-old mother of five says she and her husband are waiting for the situation to stabilize, and they have no plans to leave their tent in a U.N. camp east of Mosul until they are convinced it is safe to go home.  To return now when we don't feel at ease, we won't do it. I just want security,  she said on Thursday, surrounded by her young children.  I don't want sectarianism like before. I want something better than before, not to repeat the past.  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over Islamic State (IS) in Mosul on Monday after nearly nine months of devastating urban warfare, though Iraqi forces have continued to clash with militant holdouts. Yet authorities have not prepared a post-battle plan for governance and security in Mosul, officials say. Critics accuse the Shi'ite Muslim-led government of failing to offer a substitute for policies that alienated Mosul's Sunni Muslim majority following the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein. That has left many of the 300,000 residents still sheltering in camps on Mosul's outskirts wondering when, or even if, they should return to Iraq's second-largest city. Um Youssef told Reuters that relatives who had stayed in the city keep telling her she is better off staying put.  In Mosul, when the sun sets, everyone locks their door and doesn't go out,  she said. Her house, like many in the Old City, was heavily damaged in the fighting but she is hopeful it can be repaired. Snipers fired through an upstairs room  like a sieve , she said, and a bomb went off next door. Islamic State fired mortars at civilians fleeing toward advancing Iraqi government forces, including her neighbor who was killed. The family spent the last two days in the Old City huddled in a cellar alongside 10 other civilians with only well water and some wheat for sustenance, too terrified to go outside. A displaced girl, who fled from home is seen at a refugee camp, in Khazer, Iraq July 13, 2017.Azad Lashkari Mosul Exhausted Us  Since sweeping through large swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014 and declaring a  caliphate  over that area and parts of Syria, Islamic State has lost most of that territory. Mosul was the largest city ever to come under its rule. A reign of terror followed under which the ultra-hardline jihadist group's opponents were executed, such  crimes  as smoking a cigarette were punishable by public whipping, and music, television and the internet were banned. Civilian activity has quickly returned to much of Mosul and work is underway to repair damaged homes and infrastructure, something the United Nations estimates will initially cost more than $1 billion and take more than a year in western neighborhoods where the fighting was most intense. Slideshow (5 Images)Newly trained local police are deployed in Mosul alongside the military, but insecurity remains a part of daily life - a series of car bombs have already gone off close to civilians in areas previously declared  liberated . The security forces rely on a list of names and witness testimonies to identify suspected IS members, every day picking up men who managed to blend in with fleeing civilians in the fog of war and formed sleeper cells. Um Horeb, a 60-year-old woman from the Jabour tribe, appeared traumatized by months of violence as she lay on the ground of her tent. Both her feet are heavily bandaged from shrapnel wounds incurred in a bombing which she said killed all her male relatives. As militants retreated deeper into the city, giving way to the Iraqi advance, Um Horeb also moved homes several times, ultimately ending up in the Maydan district where some insurgents are making their final stand. She was evacuated four days ago but now, she says, she wants to stay with relatives in Iraq's nearby autonomous Kurdistan region.  Mosul has left us exhausted. I don't ever want to return. I don't have anyone in Mosul,  she said. As for Um Youssef, she is settling into an inconvenient but relatively safe life away from her hometown. Sweltering summer temperatures regularly approach 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit), but she says her basic needs are met and she has even enrolled her children in a school at the camp. Asked if she was optimistic about the future, she said:  God willing. I must be, for my children.

Raftopoulos said rangers then went to the scene, tracked down the remaining lions and dispatched them. Initial reports said four lions had broken out but Raftopoulos said  the tracks point to only three and the farmer only saw three feeding on his cow.

As we passed out of the rainstorm, we saw lightning bolts in front of us, and then lots of smoke appeared on the horizon,  said Bugge. - He paid careful attention to where the wind was blowing because winds in excess of 10 mph can make a fire spread quickly.  Bugge saw the beginnings of a wildfire that would become Portugal's deadliest, killing more than 60 people, injuring upwards of 150 and destroying more than 150 square miles of forest.  Reuters covers wars, protests and uprisings, but  ignorance makes fires one of the most dangerous things we cover,  says Mike Christie, general manager of global logistics and security.  You can't put on a flak vest or use an armored car.   To prepare, journalists take a wildfire safety course, taught by former firefighter Troy Kurth from Missoula, Montana. Kurth teaches weather patterns, vegetation and fire behavior, along with instruction on using a fire shelter. A paramount rule: never try to outrun a blaze. Instead, seek shelter in a river or stream, whenever possible.  Smoke rises from a forest fire, seen from the village of Mourisco in central Portugal, June 17, 2017.Axel BuggeReuters journalists also learn how to safely wait out a fire in a car (ignition off, headlights on), which proved invaluable in Portugal, where 47 people died on a single stretch of the N-236 road.   I am always thinking about the training,  says David Ryder, a Reuters photographer who shot the charred aftermath of the Wall Fire this week near California's central coast. This starts with the right gear. Ryder says police ushered him through a roadblock into the fire zone because he  looked legit  with the equipment Reuters requires all journalists to have on hand when covering a fire, including a hard hat, safety glasses and leather boots.  Even though the flames had subsided, Ryder remained on high alert, watching where he stepped and keeping protective gloves in his back pocket in case he needed to scramble up a hill.  Just because it looks like there is no fire, does not mean there isn't one,  Ryder says. Two summers ago, Ryder witnessed a Washington State fire near the town of Twisp turn from smoldering to raging within five minutes.   Everything seemed totally boring – the firefighters were literally warming their burritos on the embers of the fire,  Ryder recalls. Then a gust of wind blanketed the area. Soon it was filled with flames and smoke.  It was total madness within five minutes or less,  Ryder says.  After taking several photos, Ryder ran to his car. The keys were in the ignition, and it was facing the road, ready for a quick getaway.

Navalny, a 41-year-old lawyer who has organized the biggest anti-Kremlin protests in years, hopes to run against Putin in a presidential election in March and told Reuters he planned to call for more big anti-government demonstrations.  My mood is generally really positive,  said Navalny.  I have 125,000 volunteers, people turn out to demonstrate, they are detained, campaign literature is confiscated. (But) I see that people support us.       Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for the last 17 years and remains highly popular according to opinion polls, has yet to confirm whether he will run for what would be a fourth term, but is widely expected to do so - and to win.  I constantly hear that it's impossible to change anything and that there is this 86 percent (which supports Putin). But I don't see this 86 percent,  Navalny said in an interview in his office overlooking a gray Moscow suburb.  In an authoritarian country, such a number is not relevant. There will be an election campaign, people will see an alternative, and this 86 percent will crumble.  Previous opposition contenders have struggled to get their message across in a tightly-controlled media landscape where state TV hews closely to the Kremlin line and either ignores or denigrates rivals. They faced a particular challenge in areas of the vast Russian Federation far from Moscow and St Petersburg. Navalny, who has used the Internet to try to tap into public anger over official corruption, is battling to even be allowed to take part in the election after the Central Election Commission said a suspended conviction for embezzlement he describes as politically-motivated disqualified him. He has been jailed twice in recent months for his role in organizing anti-government protests, had a caustic liquid thrown in his eyes by an assailant, and investigators have raided his Moscow election headquarters. Police have also confiscated copies of his campaign newspaper and hundreds of his supporters have been detained at protests and election events.  How many times can you be afraid?  quipped Navalny, whose sprawling offices inside a business center buzz with young people working on laptops, as well as allies broadcasting from a small studio to his online TV channel.  The Kremlin's strategy is to prevent our activities. That's because the only reason for Putin's support is because nobody else is carrying out any other (political) activity.     His investigations into the high-rolling lifestyles of top government officials have riled the authorities and Navalny says his own family is now under constant pressure. Navalny has a 9-year-old boy and a 15-year-old daughter.  The security services are following us,  said Navalny.  They follow my children, my wife and me. Cars are constantly passing by. I don't even pay attention to it any more, but Yulia (his wife) is really bothered by it.   Some opposition activists left the country after opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was shot dead near the Kremlin walls in 2015. Oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested on fraud charges in 2003, after expressing political ambitions, and imprisoned until 2013 when he was allowed to go abroad. Since being temporarily blinded in one eye in the caustic liquid attack, Navalny sometimes appears with a bodyguard. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny speaks during an interview with Reuters in Moscow, Russia, July 12, 2017. Picture taken July 12, 2017.Grigory DukorThe FSB security service did not immediately respond to a  request for comment.  Critics Among Navalny's pledges: To depoliticize the judiciary, to champion a free media, to promote free market economics, to legalize personal handguns and to introduce a visa regime for visitors from Central Asia and the South Caucasus.  He told Reuters he would be willing to organize  an honest referendum  in Crimea which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 to see which country its residents wanted to be part of. The way Moscow had seized it, he said, was illegal. But he also said he thought the Crimea problem, which has soured relations with the West and triggered sanctions against the Kremlin, looked  intractable  and could poison relations for years ahead. Slideshow (4 Images)Critics have accused him of harboring dangerous nationalist tendencies with one fellow activist suggesting he was a Kremlin stooge designed to create the illusion of political competition. Navalny says he has no time for such  ridiculous  conspiracy theories and that his immigration policies are in line with  normal  European practice.              Dressed casually in jeans and a white shirt, Navalny said he was certain the authorities would relent and allow him to run in next year's election.  I have no doubt I will take part in the election and that we will achieve our goal,  he said.  One opinion poll earlier this year put his support as low as 1 percent. Navalny, however, points to the Moscow mayoral election in 2013 when he came from a low base to place second with almost one third of the vote.      He said he was using 125,000 volunteers and 60 election offices across Russia in a campaign designed to force authorities to allow him to run.  If he were barred from the election, he said, the ballot could not be regarded as fair.  He said he would deploy an army of volunteers as poll observers to ensure the 2018 vote was fair. Top officials right up to President Putin are careful never to mention Navalny's name in public, even when asked direct questions about him.

EU authorities are concerned about a  race to the bottom  as financial services firms shift operations after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019, amid reports businesses are being set up that are effectively no more than postal addresses to take advantage of more lenient rules in some countries.  Ireland has complained to the European Commission that it is being undercut by rival centers, Reuters reported in March.  National securities regulators should  mitigate the risk of letter-box entities and ensure that any relocation is effective , the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in an 'opinion', or formal guidance, on Thursday. Regulators should ensure senior management are based in the home jurisdiction of the firm and that  board members and senior managers in the EU27 have effective decision-making powers, even where the investment firm is part of a group , ESMA said. If regulators believe that investment firms, such as broker-dealers including the trading arms of banks, are not genuinely operating in their home jurisdiction,  this may provide grounds for not granting or withdrawing authorization , ESMA said. ESMA also said regulators should not design  fast-track  authorization processes. Financial professionals have said the speed with which they can set up in various jurisdictions has contributed to their decision-making on EU operations after Brexit.  I think that the fast-track prohibition is targeted at the French – the AMF have offered UK-based fund managers a quick authorization process if they move from London to Paris,  said Neil Robson, a partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman. France's AMF regulator has launched the  2WeekTicket  (TWT), a fast-track pre-approval process for firms already authorized by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority.    ESMA is saying that a quick authorization to leave the UK cannot be acceptable and that there are formal mandated authorization processes that have to be followed,  Robson said.  The AMF said the TWT was  not a license or an authorization  but a first-review service aimed at identifying whether there was any major obstacle to doing business in France.  It does not substitute the normal complete authorization process for asset managers willing to establish in France, whether they were previously located in the UK or not,  a spokeswoman said.  To our knowledge, there is no specific concern from ESMA regarding the TWT.  Lawyers also said the guidance risked a lessening of national regulators' powers.  Is there some form of disintegration of the (regulators') ability to make rules in relation to their own jurisdiction, and govern their own authorization process?” said Monica Gogna, funds lawyer at Ropes & Gray.  Secondary Trading In a separate opinion on secondary trading, ESMA said decision-making for designing, controlling and monitoring trading systems' operations should not be outsourced outside the EU. The broker-dealer trading arms of banks in Britain have previously asked EU regulators whether their entities in the other 27 EU states will still be allowed to outsource operations to London once Britain leaves the bloc.  ESMA considers it necessary that conditions for outsourcing activities to UK-based entities do not generate regulatory and supervisory arbitrage risks,  the watchdog said. In a third opinion, ESMA said regulators should also prevent asset managers from setting up letter-box operations, bringing them into line with rules applying to hedge funds.  It is a big development because the ‘letter-box’ concept is only a ... hedge fund idea,  said Leonard Ng, co-head of the EU financial services regulatory group at law firm Sidley Austin, adding legislation for other asset managers  has not previously been as prescriptive . ESMA said regulators should keep a close eye on investment managers who set up operations with fewer than three full-time staff.  Granting authorizations to relocating entities should not result in a situation in which these entities could continue to perform substantially more portfolio management and/or risk management functions for the relevant funds in their original member state,  it said.

It would suck up enough water to supply a city and leave a crater a mile and a half wide and 1,000 feet deep. Planned for more than a decade, the project would be a prototype for a looming era of more invasive U.S. mines as companies run out of easy-to-reach deposits, geologists say. It is also the project President Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, had in mind as he began crafting a  hit list  of regulations that should be killed to speed industrial permitting.  A company shouldn't have to be hundreds of millions of dollars into risk money without knowing whether there is a real chance it is going to get approved,  Ross told Reuters in a May 9 interview, referring to the mine. The massive project - which would be among the world's largest copper mines - underscores the dangers of weakening America's rigorous permitting process at a time mining endeavors are becoming increasingly complex and environmentally risky. And Ross's citation of Resolution as a poster child for suffocating regulation reflects how far the Trump administration is willing to go to advance economic growth. Sorting out the mine's potentially negative impacts is anything but simple, and many local residents, along with Native American and environmental groups, say Resolution is exactly the kind of development that cries out for intense public scrutiny - no matter how long it takes.  The companies have to mitigate their risks - mitigate what people are losing,  said Mila Besich-Lira, the mayor of Superior, the town closest to the project. A federal government review of the project has drawn about 130,000 comments from concerned constituents - more than 10 times the number who gave input on the smaller Rosemont Copper Mine nearby. The Resolution mine would also give the region a big economic boost, employing 1,400 people and injecting $20 billion into public coffers, Rio Tinto (RIO.L) estimates. It could supply the United States with a quarter of its copper, putting this small town at the epicenter of the global metals market. Trump has vowed sweep away regulations he says cost America trillions of dollars with no public benefit. The regulatory review by Ross, due for release as soon as this month, is one of several parallel efforts to slash red tape. Trump has also started dismantling Obama-era climate change regulations through executive orders, for example, and directed agencies to kill two rules for every one they create. In the meantime, Congress could set the tone. A Republican bill introduced early this year - and supported by Rio Tinto - would set a two-and-a-half-year deadline on mine permitting, a standard similar to that seen in Australia and Canada.  Deeper, Hotter, Bigger Rio Tinto - along with the Australian mining company BHP Billiton (BLT.L), which owns a 45 percent stake in Resolution - says it has spent 16 years and $1.3 billion on the project, including a decade acquiring acreage in the Tonto National Forest overlying the copper deposit. It is now four years into the federal regulatory review to approve new mines, a process that can take seven to 10 years. Victoria Peacey, a senior manager for environmental permitting at Rio Tinto, said the mine up probably won't begin operating for another decade. Rio Tinto acknowledges the vast scope and sensitivity of its plans.  There are mines this deep; there are mines this hot; and there are mines this big; but there are no other mines this deep, this hot and this big all together,  said Carl Hehnke, a geologist for Resolution. Resolution will take copper from a zone where temperatures run 180 degrees Fahrenheit. With help from remotely controlled machines, miners will set off explosions to shatter sections of the deposit.  The ore will be milled with a combination of sulfuric acid and as much as 6.5 billion gallons of water a year - enough to supply more than half the homes in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. It would eventually render more than 2,400 acres of what is now the Tonto National Forest off limits to visitors.  Roger Featherstone of the Arizona Mine Reform Coalition points to the Resolution Copper mine in the Oak Flat area near Superior, Arizona, June 13, 2017.Nancy WiechecUnder the forest, in a process called  block cave mining,  Rio Tinto will excavate material from underground, making the material above sink and creating the expected one-and-a-half-mile-wide crater.  That area will include a site considered sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which has been holding annual protests against the project. Years of Scrutiny If Resolution's copper deposit had been discovered under private land – and not a national forest – Rio Tinto might have been spared the federal review and faced only state regulators. Instead, the U.S. Forest Service is leading the study, which will consider jobs, recreation, public health and wildlife. Despite its substantial economic benefits to the nearby town of Superior, where many homes and businesses are boarded up, residents still have their concerns.  What am I going to tell my great-grandkids - how this place was totally destroyed?  said Anna Jeffries, a Superior resident, during an April 2016 public meeting with Forest Service officials at Superior High School.  Mining industry lobbyists counter that they are only seeking an efficient and reasonable approval process. Slideshow (24 Images) We are not talking in any way, shape or form about any environmental rollbacks here,  said Katie Sweeney, general counsel for the National Mining Association, a trade group.  We're talking about bureaucracy.  The NMA wants to see deadlines for permitting, along with rules requiring agencies to conduct studies simultaneously rather than consecutively. The NMA and Rio Tinto back the bill - introduced in January by Republican Congressman Mark Amodei of Nevada - that would give regulators the two-and-a-half year deadline to approve or reject mining projects. Mining companies in Canada and Australia applaud similar time limits in those countries, but a May 2016 report by a government watchdog in the Canadian province of British Columbia found Canada's mine regulation had  major gaps in resources, planning and tools  that led to  inadequate  inspections and  increasing environmental risks.  Commerce Secretary Ross told Reuters in a June 23 phone message he believed the U.S. Forest Service was doing  a good job in terms of Rio Tinto.  But he added,  The rest of the process has been so abysmal that Rio Tinto actually testified before the U.S. Congress [about] how bad the process was.  Ross and his spokesman did not respond to additional questions seeking examples of problems that occurred between Resolution and permit-issuing agencies. But his office said he was referring to Congressional testimony given by Rio Tinto’s Managing Director for Copper and Diamonds, Nigel Steward, in March. Steward called the U.S. permitting process  inefficient  and said it  presents a major barrier to the domestic sector's ability to perform to its full potential.  Rio Tinto is advocating for more certainty in permitting timelines and improved coordination among agencies involved - along with more money for agencies  to ensure that experienced and highly skilled people are devoted to complex technical aspects of permitting,  said Todd Malan, Rio Tinto's vice president for external affairs and communications for the Americas. While the company supports permitting deadlines, at least one Rio Tinto official acknowledges that it would be hard to address the issues raised by the Resolution mine in less than years.  I'm not necessarily saying time frames would not be helpful, but three years? ... That's a tight time frame,  said Peacey.

Amazon.com shares fell 0.7 percent and was among the top three drags on the S&P; and the Nasdaq, while a 0.8 percent drop in McDonald's weighed on the Dow. The healthcare index also took a hit with Johnson and Johnson and Celgene weighing on the index. Investors continued to keep an eye on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's second day of testimony before Congress, a day after she signaled a dovish stance on interest rates. The U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise rates gradually and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, though low inflation and a low neutral rate may leave the central bank with diminished leeway, Yellen said.  Yesterday's move was in response to Yellen comments that should inflation remain below the 2 percent target rate, the central bank will be less aggressive in their tightening program,  said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.  Today, the market is saying that's old news and let's focus on the matter at hand, which is earnings that will be coming out in earnest this week.  Quarterly earnings kick off on Friday with big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup reporting results. Second quarter earnings are expected to increase 7.9 percent from a year ago, after first-quarter earnings posted their best performance since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 11:01 a.m. ET (1501 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.46 points, or 0.03 percent, at 21,537.6, the S&P; 500 was up 1.09 points, or 0.04 percent, at 2,444.34. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.58 points, or 0.03 percent, at 6,262.75. Data showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly rose in June. In the 12 months through June the producer level inflation, or PPI, increased 2.0 percent, above the 1.9 percent rise expected. Another set of data showed weekly jobless claims fell last week for the first time in a month. Among stocks, Target rose 3.4 percent after the retailer gave an upbeat second-quarter forecast. The news boosted other retailers, with Wal-Mart and Costco rising about 1.3 percent. Yandex jumped 15.3 percent after the company and Uber agreed to combine their Russian ride-sharing businesses. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,492 to 1,264. On the Nasdaq, 1,722 issues fell and 919 advanced.

In the study of more than 1,000 mother-child pairs, each additional serving of sugary soda per day consumed in pregnancy was associated with higher increments of waist size and body mass in kids years later. “Sugary beverages have been linked to obesity in children and adults,” said study author Sheryl Rifas-Shiman of Harvard Medical School in Boston. Although past research has tied sodas and some fruit drinks to excess weight gain, obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, few have looked at beverage intake during pregnancy, she and her colleagues write in Pediatrics. “Childhood obesity is widespread and hard to treat,” Rifas-Shiman told Reuters Health by email. “So it’s important to identify modifiable factors that occur prenatally and during infancy so prevention can start early.” The researchers recruited 1,078 women from among patients at eight obstetric offices affiliated with Atrius Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates in eastern Massachusetts.  The study team had in-person meetings with each woman at the end of her first and second trimesters, as well as during the first few months after her baby was born. In addition, kids were assessed in early childhood, around age 3, and in mid-childhood, around age 8. Mothers also completed mailed questionnaires every year for the child’s first six birthdays. At all visits, researchers collected information about both parents and details of the household. During pregnancy, women answered questionnaires about what they typically ate and drank, including how much regular and sugar-free soda, fruit juice, fruit drinks and water they consumed each day.  At the mid-childhood visit, when kids were between ages 6 and 11 years, the research team measured each child’s height, weight, waist circumference and skinfold thickness. With these measurements, they calculated body fat percentage and body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height. When researchers looked at data gathered during pregnancy, they found that more than half of mothers had consumed more than half a serving a day of non-diet soda during pregnancy, and nearly 10 percent had consumed two or more servings a day. Mothers who drank more sugary drinks during pregnancy tended to be younger, had higher prepregnancy BMI, lower education, lower income, shorter breastfeeding times and were more likely to have smoked during pregnancy. About one quarter of the children were overweight or obese by mid-childhood, and BMI, waist circumference and skinfold thickness were highest among kids whose mothers drank at least two servings of sugary drinks per day.  Only regular sodas were associated with this difference. Juice, diet soda and water consumed during pregnancy weren’t linked to a higher BMI score in kids. The research team also didn’t see differences based on the mother’s weight, race or ethnicity, the child’s gender or the amount of soda children themselves drank. “I was surprised that maternal intake seemed to be more important than child intake,” Rifas-Shiman noted. In the future, she and colleagues plan to study the long-term effects of efforts to reduce sugary beverage intake during pregnancy. They’re now using new methods to analyze when children's intake of sugary beverages matters the most for their weight and health. “I was struck that the differences in children’s body composition were seen in relation to intake levels that appear unremarkable, even less than one serving per day,” said Sian Robinson of the University of Southampton in the UK, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “We need to know more about the long-term effects of maternal nutrition on offspring health,” she told Reuters Health by email. “Few intervention studies in pregnancy have longer-term follow-up data to describe the effects on children’s body composition.” Several of these intervention studies have been completed recently, Robinson added, and that follow-up data will be available soon. “The links between sugar-sweetened beverages and obesity are well-established,” she said. “But this new data suggests mothers’ consumption is important and has public health relevance.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tIwJju Pediatrics, online July 10, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pregnancy-soda-obesity-idUSKBN19Y1XL"},

Its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) has been affirmed at 'A' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The upgrade of the VR reflects DIB's improved asset quality metrics, supported by the recovery in the real estate sector, and repayments write-offs of and successful restructuring. DIB has also tightened its underwriting standards for real estate financing and its impaired financing ratio (NPF) has been falling consistently since 2011 to 3.7% at end-2016. The VR upgrade also takes into account the bank's diversification away from the real estate sector. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AND DEBT DIB's IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor reflect the extremely high probability of support available to the bank from the UAE and Dubai authorities if needed. Fitch's view of support factors in the sovereign's strong capacity to support the banking system, sustained by sovereign wealth funds and recurring revenue mostly from hydrocarbon production, despite lower oil prices, and the moderate size of the UAE banking sector in relation to the country's GDP. Fitch also expects high willingness from the authorities to support the banking sector, which has been demonstrated by the UAE authorities' long track record of supporting domestic banks, as well as close ties and part government ownership links of a number of banks. DIB's Support Rating Floor is at UAE Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) Support Rating Floor of 'A', reflecting its D-SIB status in the UAE and, in particular, Dubai. The sukuk issued by DIB Sukuk Limited (100% owned subsidiary) under DIB's trust certificate issuance programme are rated in line with the bank's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same rating drivers. VR The VR upgrade reflects the improved asset quality of DIB, its tightened underwriting standards, strong domestic franchise, healthy profitability, as well as sound liquidity and funding, with a large and stable deposit base. It also factors in the bank's sizable financing book concentration and still high, but declining, exposure to real estate. DIB's VR has been constrained by the bank's asset quality with a large stock of restructured financing related to its real estate financing during the crisis. The bank has successfully reduced these exposures supported by the recovery of the real estate sector. Its impaired financing ratio dropped to 3.7% at end-2016 from 10.4% at end-2012 owing to write-offs, recoveries, some classifications back to performing and also financing book growth. The bank's problem financing ratio (impaired financing + restructured financing + 90 days past due but not impaired financing) dropped to 6.7% at end-2016 from 16% at end-2014. DIB tightened its underwriting standards for real estate financing, focusing more on assignment of proceeds from other cash-generating sources and ring fencing-them, and reducing its exposure to project risk. After the crisis, DIB stopped land financing and is now re-lending to the real estate sector but on a selective basis. The bank is diversifying away from real estate by increasing its exposure to strong credit quality government-related exposures (GREs) and the services sector, which is driving its above-market average financing growth. Fitch believes that DIB is not compromising on its underwriting standards for balance sheet growth. DIB has demonstrated sustained healthy profitability through economic cycles. Similar to peers, profitability came slightly under pressure in 2016 from rising funding costs due to tighter liquidity in the market. The net financing margin (NFM) dropped by 40 bps to 3.3% in 2016 but still compares well with peers'. As liquidity improved in 1Q17 and the price war between banks for deposits has slowed down, we expect the bank's margins to stabilise. The bank's cost-to-income ratio is on an improving trend (36% in 2016), supported by strengthening operating income, and compares favourably with peers'. With impairment charges consuming less of the bank's pre-impairment operating profit (9% in 2016), return on equity remains healthy (23% in 2016). DIB issued AED3.2 billion core capital in 2016 to boost its capital ratios, which had been under pressure from high financing book growth. Its Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio improved to 14.6% at end-2016 (12.5% at end-2015) and is now in line with the UAE peer average. The Tier 1 regulatory ratio was higher at 17.8% due to AED7.3 billion additional Tier 1 sukuk issuance. Fitch expects DIB's capital ratios to be maintained as financing growth should slow down and we do not expect deterioration in the bank's asset quality. However, if financing growth picks up to its 2014-2015 levels, Fitch expects the bank to raise additional capital to preserve its ratios. DIB's deposit base is less concentrated than peers' as a result of the bank's strong retail franchise. The 20 largest depositors accounted for 34% of the deposit base at end-1Q17. The bank holds an adequate stock of liquid assets (cash balances less mandatory reserves + interbank placements+ investment securities maturing within one year), which covered 22% of its deposits at end-2016. Its financing-to- deposits ratio increased to 98% at end-2016 but is still in line with UAE peers'. However, the ratio is unlikely to increase materially from its current level as Fitch expects financing growth to slow down. Also as liquidity pressures started to ease, we expect DIB to be able to raise additional deposits if needed, given its strong domestic franchise with less pressure on its funding costs. In assessing the ratings of DIB, we considered important differences between Islamic and conventional banks. These factors include closer analysis of regulatory oversight, disclosure, accounting standards and corporate governance. Islamic banks' ratings do not express an opinion on the bank's compliance with sharia. Fitch will assess non-compliance with sharia if it has credit implications. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AND DEBT DIB's IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of the the creditworthiness of the UAE and Dubai authorities and on their propensity to support the banking system or the bank. The sukuk issued under DIB Sukuk Limited are subject to the same sensitivities as the bank's IDR. VR DIB's VR remains sensitive to deterioration in asset quality affecting the bank's capital or profitability or continued high financing growth pressuring the bank's capital ratios. A track record of improved asset quality and a further reduction in single-name and sector concentration could lead to an upgrade.

The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. The affirmation reflects the unchanged strong links between SNCF Mobilites and the French State (AA/Stable/F1+) over the last 12 months. Fitch classifies SNCF Mobilites as being credit-linked to France under its 'Rating of Public Sector Entities - Outside the United States' criteria, in light of expected very strong extraordinary support from the state, as allowed for under its Etablissement Public Industriel et Commercial (EPIC) status. The ratings also reflect strong oversight from the French government and SNCF Mobilites' strategic role in government policy. The Stable Outlook reflects that on France's ratings. KEY RATING DRIVERS Legal Status (Stronger) Given its EPIC legal status, SNCF Mobilites would benefit from very strong state support in case of need. Although the French government has no legal obligation to prevent a default (but to ultimately cover its liabilities), Fitch assumes that it is highly motivated and has the means to enable SNCF Mobilites, but not its subsidiaries, to service its debt on time. Strategic Importance (Stronger) Fitch assesses SNCF Mobilites' strategic importance to the French state as high. The group is France's main passenger and freight rail transport operator. It also controls several subsidiaries active in road and sea transport, logistics, special types of railway transport and multimodal public transport. Public service orders contracted with the state, the French regions and SNCF Reseau (AA/Stable/F1+), amounted to EUR5.6 billion in 2016 (18% of SNCF Mobilites' consolidated turnover). SNCF Mobilites also received operating grants and investment support in the form of third-party financing from regional transport authorities, mostly for rolling stock (EUR1.5 billion of public transfers received in 2016 for this purpose). Integration (Mid-range) SNCF Mobilites' integration with the French state, is assessed as mid-range. Financial links with the state are strong and take the form of recurrent dividend payments to the French government (EUR126 million in 2016, up from EUR62 million in 2015). The close financial relations are also evidenced by the significant co-financing of railway equipment by the state. The state also directly repays, through the Caisse de la Dette Publique (CDP, a fund whose liabilities are legally binding obligations of the state) EUR1.5 billion of SNCF Mobilites' financial debt. Control (Stronger) The state closely monitors SNCF Mobilites' activities and finances . It is represented on SNCF Mobilites' Board of Directors whose Chairman is nominated by a state decree. The state also monitors SNCF Mobilites' finances through a state participations agency. Finally, SNCF Mobilites' activities are controlled and regulated by ARAFER - the public authority in charge of rail transport's regulation. The group's reported net debt increased to EUR7.97 billion in 2016 (2015: EUR7.72 billion), of which 92% was incurred at the EPIC level. SNCF Mobilites has sufficient available cash resources to meet debt service obligations and any negative net free cash flow (FCF) over the medium term. At end-2016, the liquidity buffer - including EUR4.6 billion of cash and EUR1.6 billion of receivables from the Caisse de la Dette Publique, EUR0.9 billion from SNCF Reseau and EUR0.5 billion from SNCF Group - covered 2017 and 2018 debt service by more than 1.5x. The ratings take into account the ongoing market liberalisation (from 2020 and 2023 for domestic passenger and regional lines, respectively), which may challenge the timeliness of state support in the medium term. This is because extraordinary liquidity support could be viewed as unlawful state aid under EU regulations if it is used to support competitive businesses. However, SNCF Mobilites has adapted its funding policy to avoid a breach of state aid regulation. Debt raised at the EPIC level for competitive businesses within the SNCF Mobilites group is charged at market prices to these business segments. In 2016, SNCF Mobilites recorded stable consolidated revenue of EUR30.5 billion (-1.4% at constant scope and exchange rates), amid sluggish domestic passenger activity due to fierce intermodal competition. Reported EBITDA decreased to EUR2.3 billion in 2016 from EUR2.4 billion in 2015 while expenditure, mostly infrastructure fees and staff costs, increased. Foreign activities - around a-third of 2016 revenue - are expanding rapidly through growing subsidiaries. SNCF Mobilites recorded a net profit of EUR0.5 billion in 2016, compared with a EUR 2.2 billion loss in 2015 (due to EUR2.7 billion of asset write-down). RATING SENSITIVITIES A change in France's sovereign ratings would be mirrored by SNCF Mobilites' ratings. An adverse change in the EPIC status with weaker state support would also trigger a rating review. SNCF Mobilites' ratings could be downgraded if its liquidity reserves decline to levels of under two years of debt service.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

Kaufman,US,HEALTH,SMOKING,RISK,BELIEFS,Living / Lifestyle,Epidemiology,Exercise and Fitness,Psychology,Corporate Events,Vitamins,Diet and Nutrition,Public Health,Science,Healthcare (TRBC),United States,Smoking","sector":"Life","content":"Mistaken beliefs about behaviors that could reduce the risks of cigarette smoking are most common among those most vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking, U.S. researchers say.  It is important for the public to understand that the harms of smoking cannot be reduced except by quitting,” Annette R. Kaufman from the National Cancer Institute's Tobacco Control Research Branch in Rockville, Maryland, told Reuters Health by email. “Certain behaviors, such as exercise and diet, do not reduce the harmful effects of smoking if a person continues to smoke.”  The tobacco industry has propagated a variety of mistaken beliefs that certain behaviors, like exercise or diet, and certain product features, like filters or menthol cigarettes, can reduce the risks associated with cigarette smoking, the study team writes in Preventive Medicine.  The researchers used information from the Health Information National Trends Survey to find out what people believe about risk-reducing behaviors and whether these beliefs differ between people who smoke, or have smoked in the past and those who have not. They also looked at whether income levels, education levels and race influenced those beliefs.  More than 80 percent of people correctly believed that quitting cigarette smoking can help reduce the harmful effects of smoking “a lot.” Less than 2 percent of people didn't think quitting smoking would help “not at all.” Former smokers were more likely than current smokers or never smokers to believe that quitting would offer a benefit, and people with a college degree were more likely than those with less education to believe it. Low-income individuals were less likely to believe that quitting smoking would reduce its harmful effects, researchers found. More than half the people surveyed mistakenly believed that exercise reduces the harmful effects of smoking at least somewhat, and nearly half incorrectly believed that eating fruits and vegetables or taking vitamins could undo the harmful effects of smoking.  Younger adults were more likely to believe that exercise reduces the harm of cigarette smoking, and people in the lowest income category (less than $15,000 a year) were most likely to believe in the beneficial effects of vitamins.  People who classified themselves as Hispanic or  other  were more likely than whites to believe in exercise and vitamins as risk-reducing measures, and African Americans, Hispanics, and others were more likely to believe that fruit and vegetable consumption could lower their risk.  “Smoking risk-reducing beliefs are particularly prevalent among populations who may be more likely to smoke cigarettes including younger adults, those with lower income, and racial/ethnic minorities,” Kaufman said. “So, public health campaigns that emphasize the importance of quitting smoking and free resources for cessation, above and beyond engaging in any other healthy behaviors, would be valuable.  “The single most important behavior change a person who smokes can make to reduce the health risks of cigarette smoking is to quit completely, as early in life as possible,” she said.  “There are many free resources to help smokers quit, including Smokefree.gov, 1-877-44U-QUIT, 1-800-QUIT-NOW,” Kaufman added.

Russia and Belarus aim to hold maneuvers that some NATO allies believe could number more than 100,000 troops and involve nuclear weapons training, the biggest such exercise since 2013. NATO allies are nervous because previous large-scale Russian exercises employed special forces training, longer-range missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Such tactics were later used in Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and in its intervention in Syria, NATO diplomats say. After a meeting on Monday of the NATO-Russia Council, a liaison forum, Moscow's ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization called on the alliance to stop  demonising  the exercises.  Today was a major step, we were asked to brief on (the) Zapad exercises and I really hope this will help stop the demonising ... and rumors about threats,  Alexander Grushko told reporters, using the Russian name of the maneuvers.  The problem is..., we read a lot of speculation and have heard from NATO countries. Some were saying it would be 200,000 in number, some were saying 100,000. Today we gave our figures,  Grushko told a news conference. He declined to give details. Under a Cold War-era treaty known as the Vienna document, which sets out rules for large-scale exercises, war games should not number more than 13,000 troops, should be publicized well in advance and should be open to observers. Grushko said that if Zapad reached the Vienna threshold, Moscow would invite observers. Tensions Persist NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg declined to discuss Russian troop numbers that were divulged at the session of the NATO-Russia Council, which brings together NATO envoys and Russia's top diplomat to the alliance. However, he said that judging by past experiences, Moscow could still mask the true size and scope of the war games.  From previous experience, related to previous exercises, we have every reason to believe that there may be substantially more troops participating than the official reported numbers,  Stoltenberg told a separate news conference. The Baltic states have said they will press the United States and NATO to take additional security measures in the region. Estonia has said Russia may leave troops in Belarus after the exercises finish. Such a move could see Russian troops on the border with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia just as U.S.-led NATO stations multinational battalions in the Baltic region in response to Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea. Despite what officials said was a calm and professional meeting of the NATO-Russia Council, the public comments pointed to tensions that persist between Russia and NATO since Crimea's annexation and Moscow's support for separatists in Ukraine. Little progress appeared to be made on efforts to fly warplanes more safely over the Baltic Sea after the latest intercepts that both sides say involved dangerous pilot maneuvers. NATO wants Moscow to file the flight plans of Russian pilots, respond to air traffic control or identify themselves with cockpit transmitters, known as transponders.  The Kremlin says all Russian flights over the Baltic are conducted in strict accordance with international law.

The borrowing cost on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.03 percent in the week ended July 13, the highest since 4.05 percent in the May 11 week. Last week, the average 30-year rate was 3.96 percent, the mortgage finance agency said.     The jump in mortgage rates lowered mortgage application activity to its lowest level in nearly five months last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association data showed on Wednesday.      Bond yields outside the United States have increased on worries that a growing number of central banks are considering either raising interest rates or paring bond purchases if their local economies improve further.     On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada, as expected, raised rates for the first time since 2010, pushing its official rate by a quarter point to 0.75 percent.     Meanwhile, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have retreated since Tuesday after Federal Reserve Lael Brainard and Fed Chair Janet Yellen raised caution about further rate increases following a recent softening in domestic inflation.

Thursday's data from the Labor Department underscored labor market buoyancy and suggested that there was enough momentum in the economy to generate some inflation, even though price pressures still remain moderate.  It remains hard for companies to hire skilled workers. Inflation isn't slip-sliding away from the Fed's goal,  said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.  We expect they are on track to announce the start of the balance sheet unwind in September and go for the last of three rate hikes planned for this year in December.   Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000 for the week ended July 8, the Labor Department said. It was the 123rd straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent.  The drop in first-time applications for jobless benefits followed data last week showing the economy created 222,000 jobs last month, the second biggest payrolls increase this year.  A Fed survey of the economy published on Wednesday showed  labor markets tightened further for both low- and high-skilled positions, particularly in the construction and IT sectors.   Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the 30-year government bond hitting a session high. Stocks on Wall Street were trading slightly higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Producer Prices Nudge Up In another report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1 percent last month amid sustained increases in the cost of services that offset declining energy prices.  That followed an unchanged reading in May. The year-on-year increase in the PPI, however, slowed to 2.0 percent from 2.4 percent in May as last year's energy-driven rise dropped out of the calculation. Economists had forecast the PPI being unchanged last month and rising 1.9 percent from a year ago. A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services increased 0.2 percent last month. The so-called core PPI fell 0.1 percent in May. The core PPI increased 2.0 percent in the 12 months through June after climbing 2.1 percent in May.  Fed officials are closely watching inflation, which has remained below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target for five years. They have largely viewed the recent retreat in price pressures as transitory.   We expect inflation pressures to firm in the second half of the year, but any realized gains are likely to be limited,  said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Fed increased borrowing costs in June for a second time this year. Another rate hike is forecast in December and economists also expect the U.S. central bank to announce in September a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.   Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday that the economy was healthy enough for the central bank to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio. Last month, prices for services gained 0.2 percent, accounting for almost 80 percent of the increase in the PPI. Services were lifted by a 0.3 percent rise in the index for final demand trade services, excluding transportation and warehousing. It was the fourth straight monthly increase in services and followed a 0.3 percent gain in May.

Exports from the world's second largest economy rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, while imports expanded 17.2 percent, both beating analysts' expectations, official data showed. While exports benefited from solid demand for electronics and industrial goods, a growing trade surplus, particularly with the United States, may add to trade tensions as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to boost activity in his country's manufacturing sector. An increase in trade between China and nuclear-armed North Korea in the first half of the year could also add to diplomatic pressures between Beijing and Washington. Analysts say economic and political risks could undermine much of the strong trade momentum seen in the first half of this year.  Looking ahead, we expect export growth to slow on uncertainties in external demand due to rising geopolitical risks and the stronger yuan-U.S. dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2017,  Nomura researchers said in a note after the data release. China posted a trade surplus of $42.77 billion in June, slightly above analyst forecasts for a surplus of $42.44 billion and wider than May's $40.81 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected June shipments from the world's largest exporter to have risen 8.7 percent, in line with May's growth. Imports were forecast to have climbed 13.1 percent, easing from the unexpectedly strong 14.8 percent jump in May. The country's demand for imports, particularly for industrial commodities such as iron ore and coal used to feed a construction boom, has remained robust in recent months. This is thanks mostly to resilient real estate demand in smaller Chinese cities with lax property rules as authorities are keen to clear a housing glut. However, analysts say a slowdown in demand for materials from abroad may already be taking place.   Looking ahead, exports should continue to do well given the relatively positive outlook for China's main trading partners,   Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. FILE PHOTO: A man rides his motorcycle past shipping containers at the Port of Shanghai February 14, 2011.Aly Song/File Photo But we are skeptical that the current pace of imports can be sustained for much longer given the increasing headwinds to China's economy from policy tightening.  China's exports denominated in yuan rose 15 percent in January-June from the same period a year earlier, while imports jumped 25.7 percent during the period. Many economists still expect Beijing's intensifying crackdown on unscrupulous lending and a cooling property market to translate to slower growth after a surprisingly solid first quarter. China publishes its second quarter economic growth numbers on Monday. Economics polled by Reuters expect gross domestic product growth to have cooled to 6.8 percent from 6.9 percent in the first quarter as Beijing tightens the screws on financial risks. Authorities have continued their campaign to reduce financial leverage in the economy while also maintaining stability in markets. Heightened Trade Tensions?     China's trade surplus with the United States was $25.4 billion in June, up from $22.0 billion in May, official data showed, and its widest since October 2015, according to a Reuters calculation. While U.S. demand remains robust, concerns of possible trade frictions between the United States and China appear to be back on the radar. Trump has described the trade imbalances between the two countries as a  very, very big issue  that he would address.  Washington is also investigating aluminum imports from China under the rarely used section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that allows restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. The administration is conducting a separate investigation into steel. The world's two biggest economies started their 100 days of trade talks in April and agreed in May to take action by mid-July to increase access for U.S. financial firms and expanding trade in beef and chicken among other steps. Senior U.S. and Chinese officials will hold a U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in Washington on July 19, which will be the first covering economic and trade issues in a new format for U.S.-China dialogue.

Russia and Belarus aim to hold maneuvers that some NATO allies believe could number more than 100,000 troops and involve nuclear weapons training, the biggest such exercise since 2013. NATO allies are nervous because previous large-scale Russian exercises employed special forces training, longer-range missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Such tactics were later used in Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and in its intervention in Syria, NATO diplomats say. After a meeting on Monday of the NATO-Russia Council, a liaison forum, Moscow's ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization called on the alliance to stop  demonising  the exercises.  Today was a major step, we were asked to brief on (the) Zapad exercises and I really hope this will help stop the demonising ... and rumors about threats,  Alexander Grushko told reporters, using the Russian name of the maneuvers.  The problem is..., we read a lot of speculation and have heard from NATO countries. Some were saying it would be 200,000 in number, some were saying 100,000. Today we gave our figures,  Grushko told a news conference. He declined to give details. Under a Cold War-era treaty known as the Vienna document, which sets out rules for large-scale exercises, war games should not number more than 13,000 troops, should be publicized well in advance and should be open to observers. Grushko said that if Zapad reached the Vienna threshold, Moscow would invite observers. Tensions Persist NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg declined to discuss Russian troop numbers that were divulged at the session of the NATO-Russia Council, which brings together NATO envoys and Russia's top diplomat to the alliance. However, he said that judging by past experiences, Moscow could still mask the true size and scope of the war games.  From previous experience, related to previous exercises, we have every reason to believe that there may be substantially more troops participating than the official reported numbers,  Stoltenberg told a separate news conference. The Baltic states have said they will press the United States and NATO to take additional security measures in the region. Estonia has said Russia may leave troops in Belarus after the exercises finish. Such a move could see Russian troops on the border with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia just as U.S.-led NATO stations multinational battalions in the Baltic region in response to Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea. Despite what officials said was a calm and professional meeting of the NATO-Russia Council, the public comments pointed to tensions that persist between Russia and NATO since Crimea's annexation and Moscow's support for separatists in Ukraine. Little progress appeared to be made on efforts to fly warplanes more safely over the Baltic Sea after the latest intercepts that both sides say involved dangerous pilot maneuvers. NATO wants Moscow to file the flight plans of Russian pilots, respond to air traffic control or identify themselves with cockpit transmitters, known as transponders.  The Kremlin says all Russian flights over the Baltic are conducted in strict accordance with international law.

The LME has been holding meetings with several major players in the industry, the latest in Singapore on Tuesday, proposing to place its digital storage system at the heart of a new set of self-imposed regulations.   For LMEshield to work as a value proposition and the only way it can get the scale to be meaningful, is for the entire industry to buy in,  James Proudlock, head of market development for the LME, told Reuters.  The LME, the world's oldest and largest market for industrial metals, declined to give volume data for LMEshield due to confidentiality.     But industry sources said LMEshield has seen limited business since it was launched in April last year to offer a secure electronic system for millions of tonnes of metal outside the LME's own network of registered warehouses. However, another major fraud involving metals warehouses that shook up the industry this year has fueled fresh interest in such a scheme, they added.   Banks ANZ of Australia and Natixis of France, broker Marex Spectron and commodity group Glencore are all embroiled in lawsuits over lost nickel amounting to a total of around $330 million. LMEshield is another example of investment the LME has poured into new projects which have so far failed to return profits needed to justify the $2.2 billion the Hong Kong bourse paid for the LME in 2012.      The weak volumes for LMEshield are partly due to the difficulty of moving from a paper-based system, especially in Asia, and the fact that it offers no legal recourse against fraud, the sources said.  It's all about liquidity and a tipping point,  said an executive with a warehouse company.  If Party A is using the system, they can't trade if Party B is not using the system. It's a redundant system until market masses are using it.  Fresh Interest After Fraud LMEshield was developed following a $3 billion fraud three years ago at China's Qingdao port in which a trading company allegedly duplicated warehouse certificates to pledge a cargo multiple times as collateral for bank loans. Another warehouse fraud this year has sparked some new interest in LMEshield.  “Personally I am pushing for it. I think my own risk guys as well are increasingly concerned that you cannot just rely on the branding (of large LME-registered warehouses),” one banker in Asia said.  LMEshield, available in 68 warehouses, aims to provide similar security as the LME's existing LMEsword system, which provides the origin and title of metal delivered against LME futures or stored in LME-certified depots.      We are trying to build consensus among all those industry constituents...for a common set of standards by which we mutually agree to be governed,  Proudlock said.  Those who stuck to those standards would be offered reasonably-priced insurance policies against fraud,  he added.      Key to the success of LMEshield would be operating in mainland China, the biggest consumer of industrial metals, which has been off-limits to LME-registered warehouses. The LME announced last October it would launch a one-year pilot for LMEshield in China with warehousing firm Henry Bath, majority owned by China's CMST Development. The LME declined to give details of the progress of the pilot in China, but industry sources said no metal had been registered yet.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Wednesday came after the Supreme Court in June 2016 ruled for Stryker in finding that judges should have more discretion to boost penalties in patent infringement cases. Stryker declined to comment on Thursday. Zimmer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed in 2010 by Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Stryker that claimed its competitor's Pulsavac Plus device for cleaning wounds during orthopedic surgical procedures infringed three of its patents. In 2013, a federal jury awarded Stryker $70 million in lost profits and found Warsaw, Indiana-based Zimmer's conduct to have been willful. Jonker later that year ruled Stryker deserved triple damages based on the  flagrancy and scope of Zimmer's infringement.  With other fees, the award came to $228 million. On appeal, the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the nation's top patent court, upheld the jury's finding of infringement, but reversed on willfulness, which had been the basis for tripling the damages. But the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2016 said that court's test for determining willful infringement was too rigid and allowed some egregious infringers to escape liability. The Federal Circuit in September subsequently sent the case back to Jonker to determine whether Stryker deserved enhanced patent infringement damages under the Supreme Court's changed standard for awarding them. In his decision on Wednesday, Jonker reaffirmed his original award of enhanced damages and attorneys' fees.  In simplest terms, the Court believes that its and the jury's original fact findings against Zimmer, coupled with multiple legal changes that actually make it easier to enhance damages and make exceptional case findings, fully support the Court's original awards in the case,  Jonker wrote. The case is Stryker Corp, et al, v. Zimmer Inc, et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Michigan, No. 10-cv-1223.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/zimmer-biomet-stryker-idUSL1N1K40QY"},

The report, written before the central bank raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday to 0.75 percent, also said the Bank of Canada's current monetary policy stance is appropriate, and it cautioned against tightening.  While the output gap has started to close, monetary policy should stay accommodative until signs of durable growth and higher inflation emerge,  it said, adding that rate hikes should be  approached cautiously . In a statement following its annual policy review with Canada, the IMF cautioned that risks to Canada's outlook are significant - particularly the danger of a sharp correction in the housing market, a further decline in oil prices, or U.S. protectionism. It said financial stability risks could emerge if the housing correction is accompanied by a recession, but said stress tests have shown Canadian banks could withstand a  significant loss  on their uninsured residential mortgage portfolio, in part because of high capital position. House prices in Toronto and Vancouver have more than doubled since 2009 and the boom has fueled record household debt, a vulnerability that has also been noted by the Bank of Canada. Some economists believe the rate hike this week was at least partly aimed at reducing financial system imbalances.  The main risk on the domestic side is a sharp correction in the housing market that impairs bank balance sheets, triggers negative feedback loops in the economy, and increases contingent claims on the government,  the Fund said, reiterating previous warnings about Canada's long housing boom. The Fund also warned U.S. trade protectionism could hurt Canada's economy, and laid out a scenario for an increase in tariffs that could come with the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. It said if the United States raises the average tariff on imports from Canada by 2.1 percentage points and there is no retaliation from Canada, there would be a short-term negative impact on real GDP of about 0.4 percent. The Fund recommended that fiscal policy continue to take the lead in supporting the recovery, but said no further stimulus will be required as the economy regains strength - unless downside risks materialize.

Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung, citing a search warrant issued by a Stuttgart court, reported that prosecutors were examining the possible use of illegal software to manipulate emissions tests in Mercedes-Benz vehicles between 2008 and 2016.  The Stuttgart prosecutor's office declined to comment on the report. Daimler declined to comment on an ongoing probe of the carmaker by the Stuttgart prosecutor but said it was fully cooperating with the authorities, adding it does not believe cars will lose their road worthiness certification. Analysts said the latest report would spook investors, but stopped short of saying this emissions probe could take on Volkswagen-scale dimensions with millions of vehicles needing to be recalled.  We take comfort from the fact that this is a European issue, not a U.S. investigation. We also do not believe these Merc cars will lose their certification. Our judgment is that Merc will be asked to recall these cars for a 'software fix',  Bernstein Research analysts said in a note on Thursday. If Daimler did face VW-style fines of about $7,000 per vehicle in the United States, the penalty for Mercedes-Benz would be around $200 million to $300 million, Bernstein estimated.  Daimler shares were down 0.8 percent at 0927 GMT, underperforming Germany's blue chip DAX .GDAXI index which was down 0.3 percent. Daimler AG sign is pictured at the IAA truck show in Hanover, Germany, September 22, 2016.Fabian Bimmer/File PhotoIn May, Stuttgart prosecutors, who are working with authorities in the United States, conducted raids of 11 sites in Germany as part of a probe into Daimler and excessive diesel emissions.  The searches were initiated in the course of investigations  against known and unknown employees at Daimler, who are suspected of fraud and misleading advertising connected to manipulated emissions treatment of diesel passenger cars,  the prosecutor's office said at the time.  Two Daimler employees are under investigation by the prosecutor's office. Mercedes-Benz has limited the potential fallout from diesel emissions by dropping plans to seek U.S. approval to sell 2017 Mercedes-Benz U.S. diesel models. The U.S. Justice Department, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and a prosecutor in Stuttgart are investigating emissions of Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. In its quarterly report, Daimler had said that steps taken by U.S. authorities against another manufacturer in January identified software functionalities that are  common in diesel vehicles  as illegal defeat devices.  If these or other inquiries, investigations, legal actions and/or proceedings result in unfavorable findings, an unfavorable outcome or otherwise develop unfavorably, Daimler could be subject to significant monetary penalties, remediation requirements, vehicle recalls, process improvements and mitigation measures,  Daimler said at the time. In January, the EPA and CARB accused Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) of illegally using software to allow excess diesel emissions from 104,000 U.S. trucks and SUVs. Regulators have refused to grant Fiat Chrysler approval to sell 2017 U.S. diesel models.

But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan also said federal prosecutors had presented  sufficient  evidence to prove the honest services fraud, extortion and money laundering counts on which Silver was convicted in November 2015. That could pave the way for a possible retrial of Silver, 73, who has been free on bail during the appeal. A spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan declined immediate comment. Silver's lawyer Steven Molo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Once among New York's most powerful politicians, Silver was accused of collecting close to $4 million of illegal fees for awarding state grants to a prominent cancer researcher, and steering two real estate developers to a friend's law firm and supporting their interests on rent legislation. Silver, a Democrat, had represented Manhattan's Lower East Side and was assembly speaker from 1994 to 2015. Seven months after Silver's conviction, however, the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2016 voided the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, saying routine political activities such as arranging meetings or reaching out to public officials were not  official acts.  In Thursday's decision, Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes said the McDonnell holding tainted the instructions Silver's jury had been given, through no fault of prosecutors or the trial judge. Cabranes said that while  many would view the facts adduced at Silver's trial with distaste,  it was not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a properly instructed jury would have convicted Silver. The case was returned to the trial court for further proceedings. The case is U.S. v.

South African media reported allegations on Tuesday that SAP paid kickbacks in the form of sales commissions to a firm linked to the politically connected Gupta family, helping SAP clinch a deal worth 1 billion rand ($76 million) with rail and logistics company Transnet and other state-owned firms. AmaBhungane, a non-profit investigative reporting group that has a strong record of exposing corruption, named SAP in a story based on leaked emails and documents that it says show how the Gupta family unduly influences the awarding of government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The ruling African National Congress party has been damaged by leaked emails appearing to show fraud in the awarding of state contracts.  We've obviously seen the claims in the media. And we're taking these extremely, very, very seriously.  Adaire Fox-Martin, SAP co-president for global customer operations, told Reuters in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. Fox-Martin said SAP was putting the executives on administrative leave, pending the outcome of internal and external investigations that the company has initiated. The German company has hired an independent international law firm based in the United States to conduct an external investigation and also will run its own, internal probe using SAP's compliance organization, she said. SAP declined to name the four management-level employees, or their job titles. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations. The Guptas, Indian-born South Africans, and Zuma have previously denied wrongdoing. Seeking response to the fresh allegations involving SAP, a Gupta family spokesman and Zuma's spokesman did not respond to calls and emails for comment. Transnet said in a statement that it has been an SAP customer since 2000 but that it was unaware of the parties reportedly involved in SAP sales to the company.  All queries related to our suppliers and any third parties should be raised with them directly,  the company said, referring to SAP. Fox-Martin, who was named to SAP's global executive board two months ago and is the executive in charge of overseeing sales and customers service operation across Africa, Greater China, Europe and the Middle East, is traveling to South Africa to meet with customers and employees.  As a company we're initiating a very thorough and very vigorous investigation,  she said. FILE PHOTO: The logo of German software group SAP is pictured in Vienna, Austria, July 25, 2016.Leonhard Foeger/File PhotoTransparency SAP, the world's largest supplier of business planning software that multinationals use to manage far-flung operations, is acting quickly to limit reputational damage for a company that is a leading supplier of compliance software and services, among its many products. It also must ward off repercussions from regulators for possible U.S. foreign corrupt practice violations after it was hit last year with a $3.9 million fine by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company, whose stock is dual-listed in Frankfurt and New York, was found by the SEC to have failed to maintain sufficient internal controls to prevent a bribery scheme by a former sales executive who won lucrative contracts with the Panamanian government. (reut.rs/2vcPOIp)  We feel that a fast reaction to this, indicating that we are working to get to the bottom of this, will actually indicate the seriousness with which SAP takes these allegations and our intention to conduct a fully transparent investigation on this,  Fox-Martin said. She said the results of the investigation will be made public. Carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) of Germany, embroiled in an emissions-test cheating affair for almost two years, also commissioned an independent lawyers' investigation but did not publish the results as it had indicated it would. German industrial giant Siemens (SIEGn.DE) - which battled its own foreign bribery scandal a decade ago - has been swept up in a fresh scandal in which two of its gas turbines sold for use in Russia turned up in Crimea in violation of European Union sanctions. Siemens filed a suit on Tuesday against a Russian state firm, saying the Russian company had moved the turbines  against its will . On Wednesday, South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa criticized corruption he said had damaged his ruling party under  Zuma, opening a divide in the African National Congress ahead of a leadership contest set for later this year.

The deal marks another pullback from Uber's breakneck global expansion, a year after its exit from China, though it does have potential upside for the Silicon Valley online taxi hailing  pioneer, based on its 36.6 percent stake in the merged company. For months, Uber has struggled with legal setbacks, accusations of a sexist work culture and driver protests, culminating in the June departure of co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick under investor pressure. Shares in Russia's largest internet company leapt almost 20 percent as investors bet the deal could accelerate the move of Yandex's taxi business into profitability. Thursday's agreement follows the recent merger of rival Russian taxi players Fasten and Rutaxi, marking a rapid consolidation of the market.  With this deal Yandex eliminates an aggressive competitor  which, in the long run, will lead to improved monetization and profitability,  said Sergey Libin, an analyst with Raiffeisen Bank in Moscow.  It's a good deal.  San Francisco-based Uber has agreed to invest $225 million   (13.5 billion rubles) while Yandex will contribute $100 million into a new joint company in which Yandex will own 59.3 percent and employees will have a 4.1 percent stake. In a joint statement, Yandex and Uber said they would join forces in Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan to create a new company operating in 127 cities, in a deal expected to close in the fourth quarter. Yandex.Taxi Chief Executive Tigran Khudaverdyan will become the CEO of the combined business and Yandex will consolidate the new company's results in its financial statements. Yandex will hold four board seats, with Uber holding three, they said. Uber will contribute its UberEATS food delivery business in the six-country region to the new venture.   There is ride-sharing and food delivery and beyond that there are also numerous opportunities in logistics that we will explore,  Yandex Chief Financial Officer Greg Abovsky said on an investor call. Abovsky added the combined company could be spun off with a separate stock listing in a few years. The share move for Yandex, known as the  Google of Russia  for its dominance of the region's web search, maps and mobile navigation markets, signals that roughly half of the company's market capitalization lies in investor hopes for its taxi unit. Otkritie brokerage analyst Timur Nigmatullin estimated that, before the deal, Yandex.Taxi represented around 20 percent of the parent company's market capitalization. Otkritie estimated the combination could push the taxi business into profitability by 2018 or 2019. Based on the valuation of the combined company and Yandex's share in it, he said the taxi business now accounted for up to 50 percent of Yandex's equity value, which after Thursday's 18.75 percent rise hovered about $10.5 billion. Lucrative Deal FILE PHOTO: A yandex taxi is seen in central Kiev, Ukraine, May 16, 2017.Gleb Garanich /File PhotoUber said the merger did not imply a strategy of further retrenchment elsewhere. Indeed, financial terms of the deal make it a lucrative one, it said.   This is an exciting opportunity in a unique situation and our operations in other countries will not be affected,  Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, the head of Uber in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a blog post addressed to Uber employees. Gore-Coty said Uber's 36.6 percent stake was worth $1.4 billion, based on an agreed valuation of $3.725 billion for the combined company. That marks a sizeable gain on the $170 million Uber invested since entering the region three-and-a-half years ago, even with the new $225 million investment. Uber sold its Chinese business to far larger local rival Didi Chuxing a year ago in return for a 17.5 percent stake in Didi which as a whole was then valued at $35 billion.  Slideshow (2 Images)While Uber no longer exists in China, the paper value of its stake in Didi has risen to around $8 billion from $6.1 billion, based on Didi's recent funding round valued at $50 billion. Improved Driving Conditions The unified business in Russia and nearby markets also helps Uber become more sustainable, Gore-Coty said, by helping it cut losses as part of a global drive toward eventual profitability. Uber said in May its net loss, excluding employee stock options and other items, narrowed in the first quarter to $708 million from $991 million in the fourth quarter. This week, it told investors that losses continued to decline in the second quarter, a source familiar with the report said. The ownership stakes reflect how Yandex.Taxi is roughly twice the size of Uber in the region as measured both in terms of rides and gross bookings, the companies said. Yandex and Uber compete in Russia with rivals including Fasten/Rutaxi, Maxim and Gett, the Israeli startup backed by German automaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). Yandex.Taxi, which was founded in 2011, is active in 127 cities across the region. Uber, founded in 2009, is active in 16 cities in Russia and five cities in Azerbaijan, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Uber does not now operate in Armenia or Georgia. Russia's federal anti-monopoly regulator said the deal could pose risks to competition and a thorough analysis was needed before it could be approved, local news agencies reported.  Following completion, passengers will be able to continue to use either Yandex or Uber apps. The driver apps of the two companies will be integrated into a single app for greater efficiency, the companies said. Uber operates in nearly 600 cities worldwide.

The LME, the world's oldest and largest market for industrial metals, declined to give volume data for LMEshield due to confidentiality.     But industry sources said LMEshield has seen limited business since it was launched in April last year to offer a secure electronic system for millions of tonnes of metal outside the LME's own network of registered warehouses.

Banks ANZ of Australia and Natixis of France, broker Marex Spectron and commodity group Glencore are all embroiled in lawsuits over lost nickel amounting to a total of around $330 million. LMEshield is another example of investment the LME has poured into new projects which have so far failed to return profits needed to justify the $2.2 billion the Hong Kong bourse paid for the LME in 2012.      The weak volumes for LMEshield are partly due to the difficulty of moving from a paper-based system, especially in Asia, and the fact that it offers no legal recourse against fraud, the sources said.  It's all about liquidity and a tipping point,  said an executive with a warehouse company.  If Party A is using the system, they can't trade if Party B is not using the system. It's a redundant system until market masses are using it.  Fresh Interest After Fraud LMEshield was developed following a $3 billion fraud three years ago at China's Qingdao port in which a trading company allegedly duplicated warehouse certificates to pledge a cargo multiple times as collateral for bank loans. Another warehouse fraud this year has sparked some new interest in LMEshield.  “Personally I am pushing for it. I think my own risk guys as well are increasingly concerned that you cannot just rely on the branding (of large LME-registered warehouses),” one banker in Asia said.  LMEshield, available in 68 warehouses, aims to provide similar security as the LME's existing LMEsword system, which provides the origin and title of metal delivered against LME futures or stored in LME-certified depots.      We are trying to build consensus among all those industry constituents...for a common set of standards by which we mutually agree to be governed,  Proudlock said.  Those who stuck to those standards would be offered reasonably-priced insurance policies against fraud,  he added.      Key to the success of LMEshield would be operating in mainland China, the biggest consumer of industrial metals, which has been off-limits to LME-registered warehouses. The LME announced last October it would launch a one-year pilot for LMEshield in China with warehousing firm Henry Bath, majority owned by China's CMST Development. The LME declined to give details of the progress of the pilot in China, but industry sources said no metal had been registered yet. Proudlock said:  We are still in the early stages of the implementation of LMEshield in China and we are actively working extremely hard with partners and the broader industry to ensure that we gain alignment across warehousing and security standards in Asia.

A statement from Blazer's two lawyers did not provide details or the circumstances of his death. The New York Times reported he had died of rectal cancer, which he had suffered for years. Blazer, 72, was general secretary of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) from 1990 to 2011. He pleaded guilty in the United States to bribery and financial offences in 2013 and was later banned by FIFA from all football activities for life. reut.rs/2tKRfAd According to the transcript of his November 2013 guilty plea, Blazer and others in FIFA agreed to accept bribes in the bidding process for the 1998 World Cup in France and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. FIFA's ethics committee said Blazer breached rules on loyalty, confidentiality, duty of disclosure, conflicts of interest, offering and accepting gifts, and bribery and corruption. As part of the 2013 plea agreement, Blazer agreed to cooperate with investigating authorities in the United States while they investigated the FIFA corruption scandal, which eventually played a crucial role in the departure of its former president, Sepp Blatter. Blazer had accused another former CONCACAF president, Jack Warner, of having pocketed funds from a $10 million project to support the African diaspora in Caribbean countries at the time of South Africa's successful bid to stage the 2010 World Cup. reut.rs/2sS00oZ FIFA opened an ethics investigation over bribes-for-votes allegations in the 2011 FIFA presidential election after Blazer reported a possible case of bribery between Blatter and then FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed Bin Hammam. reut.rs/2uU1yR0 Warner and Bin Hammam were also banned by FIFA for life. FIFA executive member Chuck Blazer attends the 61st FIFA congress at the Hallenstadion in Zurich June 1, 2011.Arnd WiegmannInformant FIFA expressed its condolences to Blazer's family, in an emailed statement to Reuters, but made no further comment on how Blazer's death would impact the corruption probe. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn, which is overseeing the FIFA probe, did not respond to a request for comment. Blazer was born on April 26, 1945 in New York, according to the New York Times. He worked as a salesman and coached his son's soccer games in New Rochelle, New York, in the late 1970s before beginning his rise in international soccer.  Blazer kept a blog detailing his travels and his meetings with dignitaries, celebrities and politicians, including a visit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2010.   At one moment, he looked at me with a very serious gaze and said, without cracking a smile,  You know, you look like Karl Marx!  Blazer wrote.  In one blog post, the white-bearded Blazer posted a photo of himself dressed in a red Santa Claus suit smiling as he peered over a pair of eye glasses. In another, Blazer posted a video of Max, his blue and gold parrot, dancing as he stood on the front of a scooter in Central Park near a group of jazz musicians.   Go max, go. It's ok,  a man's voice, purportedly Blazer's, is heard on the video.  Blazer was on a motorized scooter along Fifth Avenue in New York in November of 2011 when federal agents approached him, the New York Daily News reported.  We can take you away in handcuffs now, or you can cooperate,  the agents told him, according to the newspaper. He cooperated. His then-domestic partner, Mary Lynn Blanks, told Reuters in a 2016 article that she accompanied Blazer to soccer-related events while he was acting as an informant for U.S. investigators, sometimes wearing a bugging device.

By Emma Batha LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - American cable television channel MTV is launching drama series in Egypt and in India with storylines on female genital mutilation, child marriage and sex work with the aim of  generating debate around issues often seen as taboo. Both series by the Viacom-owned youth entertainment broadcaster will feature soundtracks to appeal to young audiences and popular local actors who will be trained on the issues to help stimulate debates via social media.  We will be using gripping plots based on true stories from young people so that we can destigmatize issues, debunk unhelpful stereotypes and catalyze social change,  said Georgia Arnold, head of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation. Egypt has one of the highest rates of FGM in the world, and progress on reducing child marriage has stalled, with the practice even rising in some regions, experts say. In India, thousands of poor young girls are forced into sex work, often by traffickers who lure them with promises of good jobs or marriage. Both series - expected to air in 2018 - will also include plotlines around family planning and gender based violence.  In India, the cultural taboos around being able to talk about these issues, and a tendency to push them under the carpet, needs to be addressed,  said Sudhanshu Vats, CEO at Viacom 18, MTV's parent company in India. He said the name of the show in India, MTV Nishabdh, meant  not spoken . The dramas are spin-offs of a popular African series MTV Shuga which returns to Nigerian screens next year for a sixth season with an emphasis on contraception and family planning. Stars who have appeared in MTV Shuga include Mexican-Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o, who won an Oscar for her role in the 2013 movie  12 Years a Slave , and Nigerian pop star WizKid. Arnold said MTV Shuga, which is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, had already shown the power of entertainment to bring about social change. A World Bank study in Nigeria showed viewers were twice as likely to get tested for HIV, she said. Although Egypt has outlawed FGM, nearly nine in 10 girls and women have undergone the widely condemned practice which involves the partial or total removal of external genitalia. Some argue it is a religious requirement but it is not mentioned in the Koran. Egypt has also banned child marriage but around 17 percent of girls are wed by their 18th birthday and 2 percent before they reach 15.  Arnold hoped the show, which will be offered to other Arabic language broadcasters, would change attitudes around FGM.  I'm really excited to be able to tackle this issue,  she added.  It looks like things are shifting slightly, but there is an enormous amount of work to be done culturally.

Lacklustre gasoline demand growth, particularly in the United States, and fears of a repeat of last year's poor summer gasoline profits, led refineries in the Atlantic Basin to skew their yields in favour of distillates, by running heavier oil. Strong profits for fuel oil has also encouraged refineries to run sour crudes. This has compounded supply cuts, which were concentrated in heavier oils, to keep sulphur-rich crudes, normally shunned for lighter, easier-to-process alternatives, at the top of the heap. Since OPEC-organised cuts began siphoning some 1.8 million bpd from the market in January – nearly all of it medium and heavy oil – the so-called  heavy  or  sour  grades have become the most sought-after barrels. Normally, refineries would snap up easier to process light grades before the summer, when they aim to run the gasoline-rich crude so they can sell the fuel to holidaying drivers. But now, in the middle of July, sour grades are still so sought after that differentials are hitting multi-year highs.  Sour grades are like gold dust at the moment,  one oil trader said.  There's a need to fill in more sour grades heading to the U.S. and there is huge demand from the East.  Differentials for Urals, a sour grade exported from the Baltics and the Black Sea, are trading at their highest level versus dated Brent in two years, while light grades nearby such as CPC Blend and Azeri are at two-year lows. North Sea Ekofisk, a light crude coveted for its high gasoline yield, is also trading at its largest discount to sour Forties in two years, as are differentials for Angola's Cabinda. Despite a summer slowdown in loadings for China, a key buyer of Angolan oil, U.S. and Indian loadings rose to their highest in roughly a year, according to Reuters tracking.  It's an oversupplied sweet market, but a tight medium and heavy sour market,  said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of crude oil and refined products at Resource Economist Ltd. Most of the oversupply – including millions of barrels from Libya and Nigeria which are exempt from the OPEC production cuts, and output from U.S. shale – is light crude oil. At the same time new and sophisticated refineries in India and China – designed to run sulphur-rich crudes – are ramping up production. India's IOC bought its first sour crude oil cargo from the U.S. last week. Ul-Haq added that since refineries are poised to start producing heating oil for winter demand, refineries could look for even more sour oils, threatening more tightness. Still, Ul-Haq added, the sour premiums are limited comfort to those selling the oil, including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Angola.  The Saudis should be happier than Nigerians but a price below $60 per barrel is still a headache,  he said. Benchmark Brent crude was below $48 a barrel on Thursday.

Fitch expects Echo Re to continue to play a key role in DEVK's reinsurance operations outside Europe and to improve the group's geographical diversification. Fitch believes that Echo Re has built up a sustainable franchise. As a result Echo Re's rating benefits from a three-notch uplift from its standalone profile. Fitch regards DEVK's capitalisation as very strong with net leverage at 2.2x and operating leverage at 12.2x. In Fitch's Prism factor-based model (Prism FBM) DEVK scored 'extremely strong' based on 2016 results, which we expect to be maintained in 2017. Our view of capitalisation is also supported by the group's regulatory Solvency II ratio at end-2016 of 209% (excluding transitional measures on technical provisions). Including transitional measures, the reported regulatory Solvency II ratio was 284%. DEVK's business profile is strong. It is a medium-sized player in the German insurance market and has a top 10 position in the German motor market measured by premium income. DEVK's earnings are well diversified by line of business as it operates across all primary insurance segments, and it also writes international reinsurance business. Fitch views DEVK's financial performance and earnings as strong. The reported German GAAP net combined ratio was 95.8% for 2016, a significant improvement from 99.1% in 2015. Because DEVK experienced slightly unfavourable claims development in 1H17, we expect a small weakening in the net combined ratio for 2017. As a mutual group, DEVK P&C; retains all profit and builds up its capital base, which depresses the return on equity.  DEVK P&C; reported a return on equity of 4.5% for 2016, deteriorating from 5.3% in 2015. Fitch believes that DEVK P&C;'s claims reserving buffers are strong enough for the insurer to withstand competitive pressures in Germany's motor insurance market without a loss of market share or deterioration in capitalisation. As the motor line generates over 50% of DEVK P&C;'s non-life gross written premium (GWP) in primary insurance, the development of motor premium rates will significantly influence DEVK's underwriting profitability. We estimate that German motor GWP grew 2% in 2016 and expect a small increase of 1% for 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers for a downgrade of the DEVK group include the Prism FBM score falling to low in the 'very strong' category or a significant weakening of reserving methodologies. Key rating triggers for an upgrade include substantial improvements in DEVK group's life operations' market position and DEVK's non-life underwriting profitability. However, Fitch views an upgrade of DEVK's ratings as unlikely in the near to medium term. A key rating trigger for a downgrade of Echo Re would be reduced strategic importance of the company within the group. This may be manifested through a reduction in the importance of Echo Re within the DEVK group's reinsurance operations or of reinsurance operations as a whole within the DEVK group. The key rating trigger for an upgrade of Echo Re would be a significant increase, in Fitch's view, in its strategic importance for the DEVK group. However, we view this as unlikely in the near to medium term. Echo Re's IFS rating has been affirmed at 'A-'. The following seven entities' IFS ratings have been affirmed at 'A+'.

By Emma Batha LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - American cable television channel MTV is launching drama series in Egypt and in India with storylines on female genital mutilation, child marriage and sex work with the aim of  generating debate around issues often seen as taboo. Both series by the Viacom-owned youth entertainment broadcaster will feature soundtracks to appeal to young audiences and popular local actors who will be trained on the issues to help stimulate debates via social media.  We will be using gripping plots based on true stories from young people so that we can destigmatize issues, debunk unhelpful stereotypes and catalyze social change,  said Georgia Arnold, head of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation. Egypt has one of the highest rates of FGM in the world, and progress on reducing child marriage has stalled, with the practice even rising in some regions, experts say. In India, thousands of poor young girls are forced into sex work, often by traffickers who lure them with promises of good jobs or marriage. Both series - expected to air in 2018 - will also include plotlines around family planning and gender based violence.  In India, the cultural taboos around being able to talk about these issues, and a tendency to push them under the carpet, needs to be addressed,  said Sudhanshu Vats, CEO at Viacom 18, MTV's parent company in India. He said the name of the show in India, MTV Nishabdh, meant  not spoken . The dramas are spin-offs of a popular African series MTV Shuga which returns to Nigerian screens next year for a sixth season with an emphasis on contraception and family planning. Stars who have appeared in MTV Shuga include Mexican-Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o, who won an Oscar for her role in the 2013 movie  12 Years a Slave , and Nigerian pop star WizKid. Arnold said MTV Shuga, which is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, had already shown the power of entertainment to bring about social change. A World Bank study in Nigeria showed viewers were twice as likely to get tested for HIV, she said. Although Egypt has outlawed FGM, nearly nine in 10 girls and women have undergone the widely condemned practice which involves the partial or total removal of external genitalia. Some argue it is a religious requirement but it is not mentioned in the Koran. Egypt has also banned child marriage but around 17 percent of girls are wed by their 18th birthday and 2 percent before they reach 15.  Arnold hoped the show, which will be offered to other Arabic language broadcasters, would change attitudes around FGM.  I'm really excited to be able to tackle this issue,  she added.  It looks like things are shifting slightly, but there is an enormous amount of work to be done culturally.

Smugglers, some of them working with militant groups, were stealing antiquities from battle zones in the Middle East and using customs loopholes to sell them inside the bloc, the European Commission said.  Terrorists are traffickers in art, among other things,  European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters.   We cannot accept that terrorists steal cultural goods in Syria and Iraq and sell them illegally in Europe to finance terrorist attacks against European citizens,  he said. EU regulations already ban the trade in artefacts from Iraq and Syria, both countries where Islamic State and other groups have seized territory and historic sites. But traffickers have been exploiting uneven rules in the EU, making multiple stops in states with less stringent regulations to create a false paper trail disguising the origin of objects, a practice Moscovici called  port-shopping . The new rules would require traders to go through a common, stricter licensing process to import archaeological objects into Europe. They also set new definitions for protected cultural goods and gave customs authorities powers to seize them. In late-2014, media around the world leapt on the assertion by a U.S.-funded archaeologist that antiquities-trafficking had become Islamic State's second largest source of revenue after oil sales. (reut.rs/2tQiJCw) Studies since then have raised doubts on the involvement of the group - which has shown more interest in destroying ancient sites than profiting from them - and suggested much of the illicit trade may be down to unaffiliated smugglers and forgers taking advantage of the chaos. The Commission said the new rules would be part of broader efforts to cut financing to groups that have launched a series of attacks on European soil. Last week's G20 summit called for more countries to  address all alternative sources of financing of terrorism, including dismantling connections, where they exist, between terrorism and transnational organized crime, such as looting and smuggling of antiquities.

The Dalai Lama is expected to address a human rights conference in the capital Gaborone on August 17-19 and will also meet Botswana's president during the trip.   President Ian Khama will meet the Dalai Lama when he is in Botswana. But the president's attendance at the conference, for the official opening or otherwise, will be determined by his schedule,  Khama's office? said in a statement.   The Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India, has long been at loggerheads over Tibet with China, which brands him a reactionary and a separatist. The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, says he seeks greater rights, including religious freedom, and true autonomy for Tibetans.  Neighboring South Africa has denied a visa to the Buddhist monk three times since 2009 in what opposition parties and Archbishop Desmond Tutu say shows the extent of China's sway over Pretoria. China's fast-growing demand for raw materials has made it one of the biggest investors in Africa and its largest trade partner. Chinese state-owned companies have been awarded contracts worth billions of pula to build roads, dams, power stations and airports in Botswana. Tang Shenpieng, the director of politics at the Chinese Embassy in Botswana declined to immediately comment, saying his office would issue a statement on the Dalai Lama's visit soon. But Lin Songtian, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's director-general for African affairs, told reporters last Wednesday in Beijing that allowing the Dalai Lama to visit Botswana would set back relations between the two countries.   Botswana should not harm such a true friend  and reliable development partner as China and challenge the core interest of China and the dignity of Chinese people,  he was reported as saying.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Wednesday came after the Supreme Court in June 2016 ruled for Stryker in finding that judges should have more discretion to boost penalties in patent infringement cases. Stryker declined to comment on Thursday. Zimmer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed in 2010 by Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Stryker that claimed its competitor's Pulsavac Plus device for cleaning wounds during orthopedic surgical procedures infringed three of its patents.  In 2013, a federal jury awarded Stryker $70 million in lost profits and found Warsaw, Indiana-based Zimmer's conduct to have been willful.  Jonker later that year ruled Stryker deserved triple damages based on the  flagrancy and scope of Zimmer's infringement.  With other fees, the award came to $228 million.  On appeal, the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the nation's top patent court, upheld the jury's finding of infringement, but reversed on willfulness, which had been the basis for tripling the damages. But the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2016 said that court's test for determining willful infringement was too rigid and allowed some egregious infringers to escape liability.

Yields on U.S. 30-year bonds specifically were higher ahead of a $12 billion auction later in the session. Traders tend to sell the bond to bump up the yield, which moves inversely to the price, so can they buy it at a lower price at the auction in a practice known as  concession.   It has been a continued grind lower in prices, part of it is Europe, and definitely there are some people setting up for the $12 billion 30-year bond auction,  said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield was back above 0.50 percent on Thursday after a report that the European Central Bank was likely to signal in September that its will gradually unwind its asset purchase program next year. U.S. Treasury prices rose on Wednesday on what bond investors saw as a dovish congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who said the U.S. central bank does not have to tighten  all that much  because interest rates are closer to the neutral federal funds rate. Yellen repeated the testimony before the U.S. Senate on Thursday and investors were looking to see if the Fed chief would try to come across as more hawkish in a question and answer portion given the market's reaction on Wednesday. U.S. data on Thursday were steady overall, with jobless claims dropping to a seasonally-adjusted 247,000 for the week ended July 8. Claims have now been below 300,000 for 123 straight weeks. U.S. producer prices rose 0.1 percent in June, with core prices also rising. On an annual basis, however, gains in the PPI slowed to a 2.0 percent pace, from 2.4 percent the month before, adding to the narrative of low inflation. Yields rose slightly on the economic data. For Thursday afternoon's 30-year bond auction, Aaron Kohli, director of fixed income strategy at BMO Capital Markets, expects the yield to be slightly high, given the bond has not sold off all that much and the curve has flattened. A flatter yield curve suggests that investors have been buying the long bond because inflation has been low. In mid-morning trading, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.333 percent, up from 2.327 percent late on Wednesday. Before the auction, U.S. 30-year bond yields rose to 2.901 percent, from 2.894 percent on Wednesday.

The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets told employees in its technology division to  exercise judgment in determining when to adapt to business attire,  according to an internal memo from late June seen by Reuters on Thursday. It did not specify whether hoodies or sneakers, the ad-hoc uniform of millennial tech workers, constitute acceptable dress. The move, one of the first by Goldman's new chief information officer Elisha Wiesel, comes as the bank makes a push to recruit and keep hold of top tech talent in the face of intensifying competition.

Wiesel replaced Martin Chavez, now the firm's chief financial officer, as Goldman's highest ranking technology executive in January.  About a quarter of Goldman's 33,000 employees are engineers who have helped transform the firm since the 2007-2009 financial crisis by making trading more efficient and building new businesses such as its consumer lending platform called Marcus.  The majority of the bank's employees still adhere to a professional business dress code unless told otherwise by their group's manager.  Other banks are also relaxing dress codes. Last year, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said it would allow employees to wear business-casual attire on most occasions. In 2013, Barclays Plc (BARC.L) started to allow casual Fridays.

Finance Minister Kemi Adeosun's comments had raised questions about how Nigeria would fund its budget for the year and about planned foreign loans of $2 billion from lenders like the World Bank. Africa's largest economy is in its first recession in 25 years, and it had planned to borrow extensively from overseas to fund a record budget aimed at helping the country spend its way out of its economic doldrums.  We have headroom to borrow and are doing so aggressively in the short to medium term in order to address our infrastructure deficit and to stimulate growth,  Thursday's statement said.  At the same time, it is vital that Nigeria diversifies its revenue base and builds its revenue profile,  it said. That would  ensure that we do not continue to overly rely on debt to fund our budget spending over the long term.  To reduce the need for debt, the finance ministry is trying to increase Nigeria's tax collection revenues. It hopes to raise at least $1 billion from a scheme that will give tax evaders a chance to make payments retroactively. Economists have long criticised the low levels of tax in Nigeria, and in March the Abuja government laid out plans to increase the overall of tax to gross domestic product to 15 percent by 2020 from 6 percent now. Nigeria's presidency signed off on its 7.44 trillion naira ($24.39 billion) budget for 2017 in June, after numerous delays.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Wednesday came after the Supreme Court in June 2016 ruled for Stryker in finding that judges should have more discretion to boost penalties in patent infringement cases. Stryker declined to comment on Thursday. Zimmer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed in 2010 by Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Stryker that claimed its competitor's Pulsavac Plus device for cleaning wounds during orthopedic surgical procedures infringed three of its patents.  In 2013, a federal jury awarded Stryker $70 million in lost profits and found Warsaw, Indiana-based Zimmer's conduct to have been willful.  Jonker later that year ruled Stryker deserved triple damages based on the  flagrancy and scope of Zimmer's infringement.  With other fees, the award came to $228 million.  On appeal, the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the nation's top patent court, upheld the jury's finding of infringement, but reversed on willfulness, which had been the basis for tripling the damages. But the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2016 said that court's test for determining willful infringement was too rigid and allowed some egregious infringers to escape liability. The Federal Circuit in September subsequently sent the case back to Jonker to determine whether Stryker deserved enhanced patent infringement damages under the Supreme Court's changed standard for awarding them.

Most of the capital controls imposed after the crash were lifted in March, allowing money to flow in and out of the country more freely but raising concerns of an overheating of the economy. Starting immediately, Nasdaq said it would release monthly information about shares pledged as collateral. This will serve as an indicator of how much investors have borrowed to buy those shares and show how leveraged the market is, it added.  High leverage can create unstable prices and can be an indicator of asset bubbles,  Baldur Thorlacius, Head of Surveillance at Nasdaq Iceland, told Reuters.  So if the leverage becomes very high, then investors may want to know if there is an external shock or something, and prices may drop faster than otherwise,  he said. The amount of shares that shareholders had pledged as collateral to borrow money accounted for almost 10 percent of total share value in June, Nasdaq said in a statement. Iceland's central bank had estimated at the end of 2006 that the amount of shares pledged as collateral stood at about 29 percent of the market. Thorlacius said more than 40 percent of the market was pledged in 2007. In the wake of the financial crisis, a special investigation commission concluded that a highly leveraged market was one of the factors behind the collapse.  Actually we wanted to do this for a while, considering the financial crisis... Everything we do is to increase investor confidence, and this is definitely one step in that direction,  Thorlacius said.

The service, to be called Alticebank, would add another layer to the company's businesses, which have already grown beyond telecoms with the acquisition of broadcast distribution rights as well as online video advertising marketplace Teads.  The move also highlights the heightened competition in retail financial services, with mobile operators seeing the increase in smartphone ownership and the lower use of bank branches as an opportunity to challenge traditional lenders. Altice, a holding company based in the Netherlands, has expanded rapidly through a series of debt-financed buyouts in the United States and Europe. It owns France's second-biggest telecoms firm SFR Group and Portugal's biggest.  It's the first one on a European level, but certainly not the last one,  Julien Maldonato, a partner at Deloitte in Paris, said referring to online banks launched by telecoms companies.  The logic is to make the heavy telecoms infrastructure profitable,  he said. French rival Orange, which is testing an online bank, hopes to launch it nationwide to take on traditional banks with a low-cost services that will eventually expand to include loans and insurance. The service, Orange Bank, aims to break even in four to five years and was formed after the former telecoms monopoly bought 65 percent of Groupama Banque last year. The nationwide launch was postponed last month, however, to allow for additional testing. A union official pointed at the time to issues with the quality of the user interface and customer service. The Orange plan for France contrasts with Altice's current strategy, under which its new banking service would be built from scratch and need to go through a complex regulatory compliance process.  Altice has requested a banking license from the European Central Bank (ECB), the source said, confirming an earlier report by newspaper Le Parisien.  The ECB declined to comment.

Last week U.S. President Donald Trump denounced China's trade with North Korea, saying it had grown almost 40 percent in the first quarter, and cast doubt on whether Beijing was helping to counter the threat from North Korea. China has repeatedly said it is fully enforcing United Nations sanctions on nuclear-armed North Korea and there is nothing wrong with what it terms  normal  trade with Pyongyang, referring to areas not covered by sanctions. Chinese customs spokesman Huang Songping told a briefing on China's overall trade figures that total trade with North Korea expanded by 10.5 percent to $2.55 billion in the first six months of the year. While China's imports from North Korea dropped 13.2 percent to $880 million in the period from January to June, exports to North Korea rose 29.1 percent to $1.67 billion, he said. The exports were largely driven by textile products and other traditional labor-intensive goods not included on the United Nations embargo list, Huang added.  As neighbors, China and North Korea maintain normal business and trade exchanges,  he said, adding that goods for ordinary people and those used for humanitarian reasons are not subject to sanctions. Overall trade growth with North Korea slowed in June, compared with previous second-quarter months.  Trade in dollar terms with North Korea rose about 12 percent in June from a month earlier to $499 million, according to Reuters calculations based on previously released data.  The calculations do not reflect revisions to earlier figures that may not have been announced.  In May, trade with North Korea gained 14.5 percent from April to $443.5 million, previously released customs data show.

China suspended imports of North Korean coal in February, while imports of iron ore accord with relevant U.N. resolutions, he said.  China customs have all along fully, accurately, conscientiously and strictly enforced relevant Security Council resolutions.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said U.N. resolutions did not cover iron and iron ore for civilian purposes, warning against confusion over U.N. sanctions being viewed as comprehensive sanctions on North Korea.  For China to maintain normal economic relations with North Korea does not violate U.N. resolutions,  he told a daily news briefing. Adding to the potential for further U.S.-China trade friction, China had a $25.4-billion trade surplus with the United States in June, up from $22.0 billion in May, customs data showed. The surplus with the United States was China's largest since October 2015. While China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests, it also blames the United States and South Korea for worsening tension with their military exercises and not doing enough to get talks back on track, as Beijing has proposed. Though Trump took a more conciliatory tone on the North Korea issue and China's role at a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, Beijing has begun taking a harder rhetorical line with Washington in the past few days. China's Foreign Ministry this week urged a halt to what it called the  China responsibility theory  on North Korea, saying all parties needed to pull their weight. Trade between China and North Korea has declined in both 2015 and 2016, a senior government-backed academic said in a front-page comment in the overseas edition of the official People's Daily on Wednesday.  Certain countries have no right to make wanton criticisms of China,  wrote Su Xiaohui of the Foreign Ministry think-tank, the China Institute of International Studies. An  unexpected  jump in first-quarter trade between China and North Korea masked a declining trend, the state-run Global Times newspaper said last week.

Uncertainty about the size and timing of the conduct fines RBS faces, together with other legacy issues, has been weighing on its capital management and delaying its resumption of dividends. The settlement is almost fully covered by the bank's existing provisions for these claims and indemnity reimbursements from third parties. FHFA's outstanding litigation against RBS will be withdrawn as part of the settlement. RBS will record an incremental charge of GBP151 million in its 2Q17 results, which is not significant relative to its common equity Tier 1 capital base of GBP31.3 billion at end-1Q17. But RBS's 'BBB+'/Stable Long-Term Issuer Default Rating remains constrained by uncertainty about other conduct fines, fulfilment of state aid obligations and material execution risks associated with its restructuring. RBS is the latest European bank to settle with the FHFA. Its settlement equates to 17% of the related GBP25 billion RMBS exposure, higher than the average of 10% for the other banks. It is still under a separate investigation by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) into its pre-crisis RMBS business. We believe any DOJ fine would probably be higher than the FHFA settlement, based on the size of DOJ fines paid by other European banks and RBS's greater presence in the pre-2008 RMBS market.

The Warrick smelter in Indiana has annual capacity of 269,000 tonnes, its own coal-based power source and is integrated with a rolling mill.  None of which saved it from Alcoa's scramble down the cost curve in the face of falling prices, culminating in its permanent closure in January 2016.  That's different from what the industry calls a  curtailment , a temporary idling for possible restart.  But now, miraculously, Warrick is back and Alcoa will fire up three of the plant's five production lines, with capacity of 161,400 tonnes of aluminum. The other two will be classified as  curtailed . The timing of this resurrection is politically charged.  The Trump administration is determined to curb imports of aluminum, along with steel, with the aid of some heavy national security artillery. The results of both so-called Section 232 investigations are pending. And Alcoa, for one,  appreciates the actions the Trump administration has taken to address the challenges faced by the U.S. aluminum industry, including Chinese overcapacity .  The United States had 23 operating plants in 1998. It now has five, soon to be become six. There is a little more than a million tonnes of capacity lying idled, ready for restart if the conditions are right.  However, most of the lost smelters are long past the point of resurrection, with plants dismantled and sites reclaimed. China, with its massive aluminum sector and equally massive exports, stands accused, but the real smelter killers were much closer to home.   Price and Power Alcoa's change of mind is in part down to the aluminum price, which has risen from below $1,500 a tonne in January 2016 to more than $1,900 today. It has done so, ironically, on the promise of Chinese capacity cuts.  But there is also a power supply dimension, Alcoa noting an agreement with local utility Vectren to operate one of the four on-site power generation units through 2023.  This, Alcoa says,  provides important clarity for the power portfolio at Warrick , albeit without providing a lot of clarity for the rest of us.  The key point, however, is that there is always a power dimension in the mix when aluminum smelters close or restart. They use a lot of it and profitability is determined primarily by the interaction of power and aluminum prices.  West Coast Killer It was the breakdown in that relationship in 2000-01 that dealt the killer blow for the 10 smelters feeding off the power generated by hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.  One of the more interesting submissions to the Section 232 hearings on aluminum imports came from Tim Belden of EnergyGPS Consulting. Belden used the events of 2000-01 to underline the importance of power availability and price in determining smelter viability.  Those were the years now known as the Western U.S. Energy Crisis, when California was hit by blackouts and wholesale power prices went supernova. The price rises, Belden says, were  of a magnitude and duration that had never been seen before or since in any North American power market . All ten aluminum smelters closed. Five never restarted. Two tried and failed. Only one, Alcoa's Intalco plant in Washington, is currently producing aluminum, albeit after multiple near-death experiences.  The West Coast power crisis was caused by a toxic combination of too little generation capacity, a chaotic pricing model and the machinations of traders who manipulated the flawed system.  So, if you want to know who killed the northwest aluminum smelters, it was Enron.  That flawed company was at the front of the line for official sanction. In June 2003 it was stripped by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of some of its power and gas trading rights for its role in the crisis.  Financial Killer While Enron killed the West Coast smelters in 2000, bankers killed another batch a decade later. The global financial crisis brought a collapse in aluminum demand as the U.S. automotive industry went into meltdown. Prices slumped and London-traded aluminum hit a low of $1,279 a tonne early in 2009.  By the end of that year another four plants had halted production: Alcoa's smelters in Texas and Tennessee, Century Aluminum's Ravenswood smelter in West Virginia and Glencore's Columbia Falls smelter in Montana. The latter was a survivor of the earlier power crisis.  Another, Ormet's Hannibal plant in Ohio, limped on but never fully recovered and gave up the ghost in 2012. Made in the u.s., Powered in the u.s.  It's the remaining nine plants, three of them still inactive, that are now fighting for survival against what is the relatively new threat of Chinese overproduction.  While China doesn't export aluminum in commodity form, it ships out a lot of semi-manufactured products, which displace demand for the rest of the world's producers, not least in the United States.  That could change if the Section 232 investigation results in import quotas or tariffs.  How much of the battered U.S. smelter sector could be brought out of mothballs?  Alcoa and Century between them are running only two of their combined five operating smelters at capacity. Including the two lines on standby at Warrick, idled capacity at active plants is about 420,000 tonnes.  There is another 640,000 tonnes of capacity at three inactive plants.  The New Madrid smelter in Missouri was last year bought out of bankruptcy by Swiss-based ARG International AG, led by former Glencore trader Matt Lucke, with the aim of restarting the 263,000 tonne a year plant.  Alcoa has idled capacity at Wenatchee in Washington, another  Enron survivor , and at Rockdale in Texas. Yes, the same Texas smelter that shut up shop in 2008. Alcoa closed permanently two of its six lines in 2012 but four, with capacity of 191,000 tonnes, are still primed for restart.  Old smelters, it seems, can sleep for a long time. But to awaken, they need the right power price as much as the right aluminum price.  And it is  competitive power  that will determine the extent of any U.S. aluminum smelter revival.  That is why Alcoa has been able to bring back Warrick.   We were pleased to play an important role in helping make this a reality,  said Carl Chapman, chairman, president and CEO of power utility Vectren. It will likely determine ARG's success in bringing back to life what has been renamed that Magnitude 7 Metals smelter.  Missouri lawmakers passed a bill in May, freeing up utilities to enter longer-term, lower-priced supply contracts, offering the plant a potential lifeline.  The Trump administration wants more aluminum to be made in the United States, and import tariffs would tilt the playing field in that direction.  But when it comes to aluminum,  made in the America  needs to be powered in America -- and that's down to local utilities, not national policy.

Bialowieza Forest, on the border with Belarus, is one of the last and largest remaining areas of the primeval forest that once covered much of Europe. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is protected under the EU Natura 2000 programme. Tripling the quota of wood that can be harvested in one of the three forest units there, Polish Environment Minister Jan Szyszko has argued that logging is needed to protect the woods against beetles, but the Commission says it threatens endangered species and habitats.  As logging operations have started on a significant scale, the Commission is ... requesting the Court for interim measures compelling Poland to suspend the works immediately,  the EU executive said in a statement announcing its action at the European Court of Justice. The Polish environment ministry said it would prove its case in court.

Environment Minister Szyszko, a hunter who is backed by powerful forester and hunter lobbies, has said local communities need logging to protect the forest and their livelihoods, and has accused media with  leftist and liberal leanings  of stirring undue international concern.  I firmly object to insults directed against Poland and the Poles,  Szyszko said in a statement this week. It usually takes the European Court of Justice around two weeks to decide on interim measures, lawyers said. But as the court's summer holiday on starts on July 21, the ruling might not be taken before September.   The decision on interim measures cannot be appealed. The Polish government will have to conform to it,  said Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer at environmental group ClientEarth. The Commission launched proceedings against Poland last month over its refusal to take in asylum seekers who come ashore in Italy and Greece and is also demanding changes to Polish  legislation which Brussels says harms democratic institutions.

Young pretenders are still punching their way to the top as they always have - they are just not quite as young as they once were ... and are never likely to be in the men's game at least, the Swede told Reuters at Wimbledon. Wilander, leading Eurosport's coverage of the grasscourt grand slam, was one of several stars who took the tennis world by storm some 35 years ago when he won his first of seven grand slam titles aged just 17. That French Open victory was followed a few years later by  17-year-old Boris Becker winning Wimbledon, and by 19-year-old Stefan Edberg winning in Australia. A look at the four players still in contention for Sunday's men's Wimbledon final could hardly contrast more. Sam Querrey and Marin Cilic are still just in their 20s, while Tomas Berdych is 31 and tournament favorite Roger Federer is a seasoned 35-year-old. In fact, five of the last eight men were in their thirties.  I am not saying 30 is the new 20, but for sure 30 is the new 23 or 24,  Wilander said.  When we got to 30 it was a case of 'come on, he's done'. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 12, 2017   Croatia’s Marin Cilic celebrates winning the quarter final match against Luxembourg’s Gilles MullerTony O'Brien But now the real window for these guys winning big titles is between age 23 or 24 to 33 to 34. Back in my day it was something like 18 to 28.  The phenomenon is not as prevalent in the women's game. Six of the last eight were under 29 with the youngest, Jelena Ostapenko, just 20. Wilander says the reason it is unlikely we will see a male teenage breakthrough any time soon is because of the increased sporting longevity of the giants of the game. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 11, 2017   Latvia’s Jelena Ostapenko in action during her quarter final match against Venus Williams of the U.S.Tony O'Brien I was talking to (34-year-old beaten quarter-finalist) Gilles Muller the other day and he was telling me he is a much better player today than he was 10 years ago.  He, like many of the other guys, is really taking care of his body. The guys now are making more money, they have got the trainers and the therapists and the physios to really take care of themselves.  They really are not fading and as a consequence there is less space at the top. More of the players at the top now have even more experience. And it is that experience which is really, really valuable.  It is taking new talent longer to find its place in the upper echelon of the game, Wilander said.  Twenty-four or 25, that is when these guys are just coming into their peak,  he said.  They are just becoming a real threat. Because everything is much, much tougher now. When we started aged 15 or so, there was less to figure out in those days.  Milos Raonic, Grigor Dmitrov (both 26)... they are the age where they are coming through. These young guys are coming still, they just won't ever be as young as they used to be.

Power utility Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA wants to be part of a Brookfield-led turnaround of Renova, two of the people said. The utility known as Cemig owns 34.2 percent of Renova. That stance could sink Brookfield's proposed 1.6 billion-real ($499 million) cash offer for control of Renova, the people said. Cemig plans to first sound out interest from distressed debt giant Oaktree Capital Management LP and two other unidentified funds in Renova, two of the people said. Reuters reported on Friday that Canada-based Brookfield would buy out the combined 63.5 percent that Cemig, Light SA and RR Participações SA have in Renova for 810 million reais. The Canadian firm would then pump an additional 800 million reais into Renova to win full management rights. Cemig and Brookfield declined to comment. Rio de Janeiro-based Light referred questions on Renova to Cemig, which also controls it. Snubbing Brookfield, which has made a number of high-profile infrastructure and energy takeovers in Brazil in the past year, is  risky for Renova since it faces a heavy repayment calendar and a fragile cash position,  said one of the people, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Renova's units, the company's most widely traded class of stock, have gained almost 30 percent since Jan. 2, on expectations a takeover could save the company from a chronic cash shortage or even bankruptcy. Reuters first reported that Renova could be taken over on March 1. Renova has struggled with a severe cash crunch over the past couple of years. Financing conditions for Renova, which was founded in 2001, worsened significantly when a partnership with SunEdison Inc collapsed weeks before the latter filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. Exiting Renova would allow Cemig, Brazil's No. 3 power utility, to facilitate the refinancing of almost 5 billion reais of debt maturing this year. This week, Chief Financial Officer Adezio Lima said the partial or full sale of Cemig's and Light's stakes in Renova could take up to 60 days. Interest in Brazil's renewable power industry is growing, especially among foreign investors who see it as a resilient play despite declining electricity consumption and a harsh recession.

(Reuters) - The blast furnaces and slab casters at United States Steel Corp's Granite City Works have been idle for 18 months, and laid-off workers here are pinning their hopes on President Donald Trump imposing broad new restrictions on imported steel. Yet just across the Mississippi River, some manufacturers worry that new tariffs and curbs Trump is weighing under a  Section 232  national security review will raise their cost and make it harder to compete with foreign rivals.  The inherent conflict between suppliers and buyers is at the heart of a debate inside the administration that lobbyists and lawmakers say could delay or weaken any protections recommended by the U.S. Commerce Department. The review's findings, originally expected by the end of June, could be unveiled in the coming weeks. The Cold War-era law that allows the president to restrict imports of goods deemed critical to national defense pits an iconic industry that has been struggling with imports for decades against those that have benefited from China flooding the world steel market with excess production. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2oPeo1z) According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data compiled by the libertarian Cato Institute, steel mills and steel product factories now employ about 140,000 people, compared to 6.5 million at steel-reliant manufacturers ranging from autos and appliances to machinery.    Hopes and Concerns In Granite City, where about 1,200 of the U.S. Steel plant's 1,800 workers remain laid off despite the recent restart of some  rolling mill operations, there is an air of keen anticipation.  We're waiting on the 232 to get us back to work,  said Chris Bragg, who was laid off in November 2015 when steel imports surged and oil prices cratered, slashing demand for the mill's main product, hot-rolled steel for oil and gas drilling pipe. The 46-year-old father of three has been working in home construction since then, making less than half of the $55,000 he earned in his last year working on U.S. Steel's basic oxygen furnace, which melts iron and alloys into steel.  There were few dinners out, no vacations and no high school graduation presents for Bragg's twin sons last year. TJ's Place, a bar across the street from a plant gate,  canceled its fish fries and taco nights and could close if more workers are not called back, said bartender Diane Valerius.  If that mill shuts down, this town is dead.   Idled steelworkers Reuters interviewed in this factory suburb see the  Section 232  probe as a key test of Trump's commitment to campaign promises to revive U.S. manufacturing and curb imports from China and South Korea.    I voted for Trump because the Democratic Party was going to kill the coal industry and the steel industry in one fell swoop,  said Bill Wiley, 50, a laid-off apprentice millwright.  Somebody has to stick up for us. We’re just asking for a level playing field.  Across the Mississippi in north St. Louis, factory managers at Bachman Machine Co worry new tariffs and curbs could raise steel prices, putting the 90-year-old maker of stamped steel auto parts at a disadvantage against Mexican suppliers.  Anything that is out of the norm in terms of a price change is going to be a negative factor for us. If we can't pass that on, then that hurts us,  said Jerry Ernsky, Bachman's head of sales and marketing.  The 100-employee company buys from steel distributors and often does not know the origin of the steel it uses to make parts for seats, airbags, door mechanisms and other components, Ernsky said. These are sold to larger auto suppliers such as Toyoda Gosei in Perryville, Missouri, and ultimately find their way to the U.S. assembly plants of Toyota, Honda, Ford and other automakers.  Historic building exterior at U.S. Steel Corp's Granite City Works in Granite City, Illinois, U.S. on July 5, 2017.David LawderKei Pang, chief executive of Ferguson, Missouri-based Nidec Motor Corp, the former Emerson Electric motors unit now owned by Japan's Nidec Corp, warned Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a letter that import curbs on certain electrical steels  would cause serious and material harm to our companies, our employees, and our customers.  AK Steel is the only remaining U.S. manufacturer of electrical steel, a specialty product with precise magnetic properties used in transformers and motors. It has argued that it needs protection because domestic supplies are needed to safeguard the U.S. electrical grid. Tubular Target  In similar public comments, U.S. Steel has called for  import restrictions on tubular goods for the oil and gas industry as a way of safeguarding U.S. energy independence, a critical national security goal. Foreign steelmakers now supply half the oil and gas drilling and extraction pipe used in the United States. Slideshow (8 Images)Direct imports from China were largely cut off by successful anti-dumping cases in recent years, only to be replaced by pipe imports from South Korea, which since April have been subject to increased duties. But as U.S. energy firms boost production, foreign-made steel pipes are still flooding into U.S. ports. Based on June import permit data, The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates that imports of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry are up 237 percent in the first half of 2017 from a year earlier.  Ross, the Commerce chief, has indicated he might support protection for U.S. makers of pipes and their suppliers. He told a congressional hearing in June that steel was a  genuine national security issue  and pointed out how a U.S. tubular mill made the body of the massive conventional bomb dropped on Islamic State militants in Afghanistan in April. The 79-year-old billionaire is best known for his work restructuring several bankrupt U.S. steel companies in the early 2000s, selling them to what is now Arcelor Mittal. He is formulating trade policy alongside U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer who represented U.S. Steel in anti-dumping cases. On the other side of the argument, steel users have enlisted dozens of industry trade groups to make the case against broad steel import restrictions. The American Petroleum Institute and 10 other oil and gas trade groups urged Commerce to narrowly define national security and  to consider the potential negative effects of U.S. tariffs or quotas or other measures that would raise the cost of steel inputs for the oil and natural gas industry.  It remains unclear what actions Ross will recommend, whether Trump will implement that.  U.S. Steel has not indicated how the Trump administration's review may alter its production plans, saying in a statement that it was  interested to review the results of the 232 investigation.  Idled workers say the uncertainty is gnawing at them.   There's nothing that Trump's done as of yet  for steelworkers, said Paul Morris, 55.  All we can do is sit back and wait.

Most of the capital controls imposed after the crash were lifted in March, allowing money to flow in and out of the country more freely but raising concerns of an overheating of the economy. Starting immediately, Nasdaq said it would release monthly information about shares pledged as collateral. This will serve as an indicator of how much investors have borrowed to buy those shares and show how leveraged the market is, it added.  High leverage can create unstable prices and can be an indicator of asset bubbles,  Baldur Thorlacius, Head of Surveillance at Nasdaq Iceland, told Reuters.  So if the leverage becomes very high, then investors may want to know if there is an external shock or something, and prices may drop faster than otherwise,  he said. The amount of shares that shareholders had pledged as collateral to borrow money accounted for almost 10 percent of total share value in June, Nasdaq said in a statement. Iceland's central bank had estimated at the end of 2006 that the amount of shares pledged as collateral stood at about 29 percent of the market. Thorlacius said more than 40 percent of the market was pledged in 2007. In the wake of the financial crisis, a special investigation commission concluded that a highly leveraged market was one of the factors behind the collapse.  Actually we wanted to do this for a while, considering the financial crisis... Everything we do is to increase investor confidence, and this is definitely one step in that direction,  Thorlacius said.

TCS, part of the salt-to-software Tata Sons conglomerate, reported consolidated net profit for the three months to June 30 fell nearly 6 percent from a year earlier to 59.5 billion rupees ($923.2 million). Analysts on average had expected 61.81 billion rupees. India's more than $150 billion software services sector is facing headwinds in its biggest market, the United States, as clients hold back technology spending due to uncertainty over President Donald Trump's order for a review of a visa program for skilled workers. Indian IT firms use the H-1B visa program to fly in engineers and developers to service U.S. clients. Adding to the sector's woes, the Indian rupee has appreciated about 5 percent this year against the U.S. dollar, making exports costlier. TCS was seeing a  strong pipeline  for new deals in the key North American market, especially from smaller customers, Chief Executive Rajesh Gopinathan told a news conference. In the banking, services and insurance segment, the company was seeing strong demand from the  bottom of the pyramid  as new entrants are coming into the sector, he said.  From an overall demand perspective looking forward we see a combination of strong demand for smaller projects coming out of newer areas like digital and some amount of very large transformation deals, especially in the insurance space,  said Gopinathan, who took the top job in February. Chief Financial Officer V. Ramakrishnan said in a statement that the rupee's appreciation against the dollar meant a loss of 6.50 billion rupees in reported revenue. Revenue for the quarter rose 1 percent from a year earlier to 295.84 billion rupees. Brokerage Kotak described the TCS first-quarter numbers as weak, adding it expected further cuts to its own and consensus earnings-per-share estimates of the company. The brokerage said in a client note it maintained its  reduce  rating on the stock. TCS added one client with annual billing of $100 million-plus and one with billing of more than $50 million in the June quarter, TCS said. It hired a gross 11,202 employees in the quarter.

For most of the day the mood had been one of relief that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen had not sounded more hawkish in her appearance before Congress the previous day, a green light for risk-taking. Wall Street started steadily after another record peak for the Dow Jones Industrial Average while the dollar steadied just off a nine-month low just in time for day two of Yellen's semi-annual Washington grilling. But bond markets were in the red again after the Wall Street Journal reported that the ECB is likely to signal in September that its asset purchase programme will be gradually wound down next year. Yields on U.S. Treasuries, which move inversely to prices, crept higher and Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield gave up all of its early falls to move back above 0.50 percent. Currency markets churned too. The euro climbed to $1.1415 from as low as $1.1370, hit after earlier ECB policymaker talk of extending stimulus. It had been as high as $1.1489 in Asia after Yellen side-swiped the dollar. The WSJ report  has focused attention again on that the ECB is going to be taking steps in a more hawkish direction,  said TD Securities European head of FX strategy Ned Rumpeltin, also citing news that ECB President Mario Draghi will address the Jackson Hole central banking conference next month. The star performer overnight had been the Canadian dollar, which rocketed to 11-month highs after the country's central bank hiked interest rates for the first time in seven years and left the door wide open to further moves. Sentiment got another boost when China reported upbeat data on exports and imports for June, the latest sign that global trade is finding some traction again. It had helped push Asian shares up more than 1 percent and lift MSCI's 47-country world index to its latest record high, and though it took a while, Europe's main bourses eventually muscled higher too. Traders there began hoovering up banks and commodity stocks again after a 1.6 percent gain on Wednesday had given the regional STOXX 600 its best day since April's French election victory for Emmanuel Macron.  It mostly seems to be down to Yellen,  Rabobank quantitative analyst Bas Van Geffen said. One of the Fed chief's comments that markets latched onto was her view that the U.S. central bank would not need to raise rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the  neutral  funds rate. Oh Canada Equities were also underpinned by the overnight drop in bond yields as Yellen sounded cautious on inflation. Indeed, markets doubt even that modest Fed tightening will ensue and imply only a 50-50 chance of a interest rate rise by December. Treasuries had rallied in reaction, with yields on two-year notes falling to three-week lows before the ECB talk turned markets around. Up until that point the odd one out had been Canada, where yields hit their highest since late 2013 after the Bank of Canada raised rates by quarter of a point, saying the economy no longer needed as much stimulus. The Canadian dollar notched its biggest percentage gain since March 2016 and was last trading near one-year peaks at C$1.2726. The Aussie and Kiwi dollars jetted higher too. The main loser was the U.S. dollar which slipped as far as 112.86 on the yen before recovering back to 113.32. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was still within a whisker of nine-month lows at 95.75 as it levelled off in early U.S. trading. The moves in U.S. yields benefited gold, which pays no interest, and pushed the precious metal up 0.3 percent to $1,223.16 and away from its recent trough of $1,204.45. Oil prices flatlined as producer club OPEC said it expected demand to decline next year as rivals pump more, though the Chinese trade data showed it remained a heavy buyer. Brent crude futures were up 10 cents at $47.85 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 18 cents to $45.68. Asia's share market gains had also lifted Indian stocks to an all-time high. South Korea and Australia's main indexes both climbed 1.1 percent too, the former helped as its central bank kept interest rates at a record low. Japan's Nikkei had been restrained by a firmer yen and ended flat, though emerging market stocks stood tall as they climbed to a new 26-month high on the Fed's soothing signals.  Dollar positioning is short and yesterday's testimony just confirmed what the market believed: that the Fed is not going to be able to be as hawkish as they are suggesting,  said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 FX strategy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London.

Germany has become the first European Union country to tighten its rules on foreign corporate takeovers following a series of Chinese deals giving access to Western technology and expertise. The new regulations will allow the German government to block takeovers if there is a risk of critical technology being lost abroad. They will take effect shortly with no need for parliamentary approval. Four German firms catering to the auto industry -- FFT, Eisenmann, ZF Body Controls and Eissmann Automotive -- are currently talking to potential Chinese buyers, but do not expect political interference, the sources said.   These assets are not the type of technologically critical assets that Germany wants to protect,  a banker familiar with the deals said.  If the state were to start interfering in these kinds of deals, that would be the end of dealmaking in Germany.  FFT, a maker of manufacturing facilities for car makers owned by private equity investor Aton, has attracted first round offers from Chinese bidders such as Shanghai Electric (601727.SS) in a Morgan Stanley (MS.N)-led deal, people close to the matter said.  The company may reap a valuation of roughly half a billion euros or 8 to 9 times its expected 2017 core earnings of about 60 million euros ($68.5 million). The deal is expected to come at a lower valuation than what Midea (000333.SZ) paid for robotics maker Kuka (KU2G.DE) last year. While both groups make car production gear, FFT specializes on assembly lines but does not supply robots itself, weighing on the valuation, the people said. Family-owned paint shop maker Eisenmann has attracted two Chinese bidders, who are in the final round of a sales process organized by UBS (UBSG.S). The company, which has 70 million euros in expected 2017 core earnings may be valued at 400-500 million euros in a deal that may be signed as early as this summer, according to sources close to that deal.  ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] is also in the final stages of talks with one Chinese bidder on the sale of its $1 billion Body Controls unit, which it put on the block last year, according to sources familiar with the situation. Separately, German car interior maker Eissmann Automotive, which is being marketed by Lazard (LAZ.N), has caught the eye of a number of Chinese firms, people close to that deal said.

Yellen's comments were part of her two-day semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress. She will resume her testimony at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). Investor cheered Yellen's view of gradual increase in rates on Wednesday, with world shares hitting their fourth all-time high in less than a month on Thursday. The Dow rose to a record high close while U.S. stocks kept their upward momentum on Wednesday following Yellen's comments. The U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, though low inflation and a low neutral rate may leave the central bank with diminished leeway, Yellen said. The U.S. economy grew at a  slight to moderate  pace over the last several weeks across all regions of the country, with wage pressures reported for both low- and high-skilled jobs, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday in its latest compendium of regional economic activity.  Her speech was labeled as dovish due to no signs of any aggressive rate hikes or having a firm plan in relation to scaling down their balance sheet,  said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK. At 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.67 points, or 0.1 percent, at 21,552.81, the S&P; 500 was up 3.25 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,446.50.

Data showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly rose in June as sustained increases in the cost of services offset declining energy prices, suggesting a recent moderation in inflation was likely temporary. In the 12 months through June the producer level inflation, or PPI, increased 2.0 percent, above the 1.9 percent rise expected. Data from the U.S. Labor Department showed jobless claims falling last week for the first time in a month. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped to 247,000 for the week ended July 8, from 248,000. On the stocks, Delta shares were down 2.3 percent, after the No.2 U.S. airline's quarterly profit missed analysts' expectations. Target rose 3.8 percent after the retailer said it expects a  modest  increase in second-quarter comparable sales, the first rise in five quarters. Yandex jumped 16.5 percent after the company and Uber agreed to combine their Russian ride-sharing businesses. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,388 to 1,101.

The repeal bill is central to the government's plan to exit the EU in 2019, disentangling Britain from more than 40 years of EU lawmaking on everything from finance to fisheries and repealing the treaty that first made Britain a member in 1972. Its passage through parliament could make or break Theresa May's future as prime minister. The election she called last month cost her an outright parliamentary majority and reopened the debate on the nature of Brexit, with Britain's public spending watchdog now saying the government is not well prepared.  It is one of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever passed through parliament and is a major milestone in the process of our withdrawal from the European Union,  Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement. The government also fleshed out its negotiating stance with the EU, publishing three position papers which underlined that Britain would quit nuclear body Euratom and leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. May faces a battle even within her own Conservative Party to stick to her plan of a clean break. Pro-Brexit lawmakers will give her little room for movement, while pro-Europeans are looking to soften the divorce terms.

If she fails, her position could swiftly become untenable. Road To  Hell  The publication of the bill is the first step in a long legislative process to ease Brexit, which is stretching the government with the sheer volume of issues to cover. A report by the government's spending watchdog said Britain's planned new customs system, essential to smooth trade, might not be ready in time for Brexit, adding to a list of concerns over the government's plans. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves Downing Street, London, Britain July 11, 2017.Peter Nicholls We have been clear from the outset that we are putting the resources in place, have got the resources in place that we need to deliver on Brexit,  May's spokesman told reporters. The parliament has yet to set a date to debate the bill, which will be closely examined to see how the government plans to carry out the difficult and time-consuming technical exercise of transposing EU law. The bill set out powers for ministers, with the approval of parliament, to correct laws to ensure they work after being brought into British law. These powers will exist until two years after the day Britain leaves. A government document, released alongside the bill, offered the example of current town and planning regulations which now refer to  other EEA (European Economic Area) states . That would need to be changed to  EEA states , dropping the 'other', for the regulations to work. In other areas, existing laws require Britain to seek an opinion from the European Commission before a project is approved - something also that will need to be changed. Lawmakers have expressed concern that the sheer volume of work could limit their ability to scrutinize the changes effectively and fear the government will introduce policy change by the back door.  The main opposition Labour Party has said it would oppose the bill unless it met six conditions, including guarantees for workers' rights. Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said he would work to soften May's stance, promising the prime minister that  this will be hell . The bill will also face scrutiny from British companies, many of which have spent the year since Britons voted by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU trying to figure out how the change will affect their business.  A legislative transition of this scope has never before been undertaken,  Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said in a statement.  We will be keeping a watchful eye for the possibility of unintended consequences that lead to new burdens or compliance costs.

Bialowieza Forest, on the border with Belarus, is one of the last and largest remaining areas of the primeval forest that once covered much of Europe. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is protected under the EU Natura 2000 programme. Tripling the quota of wood that can be harvested in one of the three forest units there, Polish Environment Minister Jan Szyszko has argued that logging is needed to protect the woods against beetles, but the Commission says it threatens endangered species and habitats.  As logging operations have started on a significant scale, the Commission is ... requesting the Court for interim measures compelling Poland to suspend the works immediately,  the EU executive said in a statement announcing its action at the European Court of Justice. The Polish environment ministry said it would prove its case in court.

Environment Minister Szyszko, a hunter who is backed by powerful forester and hunter lobbies, has said local communities need logging to protect the forest and their livelihoods, and has accused media with  leftist and liberal leanings  of stirring undue international concern.  I firmly object to insults directed against Poland and the Poles,  Szyszko said in a statement this week. It usually takes the European Court of Justice around two weeks to decide on interim measures, lawyers said. But as the court's summer holiday on starts on July 21, the ruling might not be taken before September.   The decision on interim measures cannot be appealed. The Polish government will have to conform to it,  said Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer at environmental group ClientEarth.

The best execution firm, which was founded by former Morgan Stanley executives Pete Eggleston and Oliver Jerome, launched post-trade transaction cost analysis in September 2016 for spot FX, forwards, non-deliverable forwards and FX swaps. A pre-trade analysis tool was added at the start of this month, while TCA for vanilla FX options will be launched in the coming weeks. Under sweeping MiFID II reforms taking effect from January, market participants must prove best execution on a broad range of over-the-counter trades, including bonds and swaps. That has led to calls for the new FX tool to be expanded to fixed income products.  Enough of our clients have asked for us to provide the service for more than FX that we thought we should do something,  said Eggleston, director of BestX. The firm recently hired a fixed income quant to build a platform for the asset class, beginning with the most liquid products, such as interest rate swaps, sovereign bonds and fixed income futures.  We've built a rigorous FX platform and we didn't want to bolt on something that was not implemented to the same rigour so we're starting in the rates space where there's sufficient data to do something rigorous and meaningful,  said Eggleston. Expansion into investment grade credit products analytics is expected to follow later in 2018. MiFID II requires participants to achieve the best possible result for clients, taking into account a range of execution factors, which can include overall trade cost, spread impact and signalling risk.  The MiFID II definition is a good one as it talks about different factors and is a much more holistic view of best execution. We're no longer in a world where people just equate best execution to best price,” said Eggleston. “You may well trade on the best price, but your counterparty could then go and spray that risk across the market, creating an enormous footprint that may be very damaging to you if you've got more trades to do that morning.  BestX enables participants to implement and codify their best execution policy in the software and ensure those parameters are met using data from a broad range of sources. Less than a year since launch, BestX has attracted 20 live clients with more than 20 others currently in talks for onboarding. While primarily a buyside tool, the initial crop of clients includes JP Morgan and HSBC, which are using the service for independent validation on execution quality for their own clients.  A lot of clients really like the way we're thinking about execution in the OTC world because we're not just taking equity-type models and shoe-horning them into an OTC world,  said Eggleston.  Some of our clients have been frustrated with products that take an equity framework and try to adapt it for rates. We're really thinking about it from an OTC perspective and that's a real differentiator.  Equity best execution products are built around a framework that processes trades after the market close for next-day reporting. That is not easily adapted for OTC markets, particularly FX and rates, given the round-the-clock and global nature of trading.  We've been able to build something totally real-time so a client doesn't have to wait until tomorrow to see what the metrics look like around best ex on a given trade. They'll get it a few seconds after the trade has finished,  said Eggleston. Real-time analysis is supported by high performing coding language, Julia, while cloud computing ensures BestX can handle large volumes of data compared to legacy providers, which typically use batch-based architecture. Last December, the start-up struck an agreement with Thomson Reuters, IFR's parent company, for data and connectivity with TR's FXall and FX Trading platforms.

Data released on Thursday by London-based campaign group Global Witness showed that 49 of 200 land rights activists killed last year were from South America's largest country, making Brazil the world's most dangerous nation for campaigners.   By the time I got here, (security forces) had already broken down the door and taken my things,  Conceicao, 36, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, recalling his eviction from his home in the southwestern Amazonas State seven months ago.  Then they knocked down my house.  Outside the wreckage of his home, neighbors also say they were forced out by military police at the behest of a powerful local rancher who wanted the land.    Activists say impunity for powerful ranchers in remote regions like the Amazon, coupled with the growing power of Brazil's farm lobby in congress, is fuelling land violence. At least 200 people were killed in land disputes in 2016, up from 185 in 2015, according to Global Witness, making it the bloodiest year on record with 60 percent of killings in Latin America. Maristela Lopes da Silva, an activist with the Rural Workers Union in Boca do Acre, a Brazilian advocacy group which supports smallholder farmers during land conflicts, said violence is rising because of inequality and impunity.    Here, the law only belongs to the powerful,  da Silva told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a wooden house which serves as the Workers' Union headquarters in Boca do Acre.      As well as Conceicao and his neighbors in the last six months, more than 200 households have been displaced in Boca do Acre, a municipality with about 30,000 residents, da Silva said.   The government only issues measures to favor big ranchers,  she said.  While Global Witness recorded 49 land-related killings in Brazil last year, local rights groups put the number at about 61 - with 2017 set to be worse, according to the Pastoral Land Commission, an advocacy group linked to the Catholic Church.  Ongoing Investigations    Brazilian prosecutors say they are investigating the evictions of Conceicao and his neighbors as part of an effort to crackdown on land violence. Having security forces knock down houses without prior warning and not allowing residents to remove their possessions is unlawful, said federal prosecutor Fernando Soave. If the rancher did have a legitimate claim to the land where Conceicao and the others were living then evictions still are not supposed to happen until there has been a public meeting between the conflicted parties, the prosecutor said.   There are a lot of illegal (evictions) happening in this region,  Soave told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  But he said he feared that if local authorities could not reduce conflicts, large farm operators in the region will form  armed militias  - as they have in other rural areas - to drive smallholder farmers from the land. Local security forces say they acted lawfully in destroying Conceicao's home and impunity for big ranchers is not a major problem in the region.   We would never abuse our authority, I would never put my career at risk,  Lieutenant Miqueias Mariano de Oliveira, who led operations in the area, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  He said conflicts in the area are due to small farmers like Conceicao  invading  land that belongs to large operators.  The rancher is the victim. There is an increasing risk of confrontation from invaders against owners and death in the region,  Oliveira said.  Conceicao and his neighbors said they had a claim to the land, although they did not have full formal ownership over the property - a common problem in rural Brazil where most farmers do not have complete title deeds to the land they work.    They said we are land invaders, but it's not true,  said evicted corn grower Aureolindo Nascimento Barbosa, 47. The rancher could not be reached for comment.  Analysts believe new measures signed by Brazilian President Michel Temer this week will further stoke land violence. These include measures to allow rural property owners to regularize up to 2,500 hectares of public land if they have been farming it, up from the current 1,500 hectares.  Critics say the rule will allow large farmers to claim swathes of land occupied by smallholder farmers like Conceicao. Supporters of the changes say they will help farmers formally register their properties, making it easier for authorities to track who owns land and reducing conflicts.   The new limit of 2,500 hectares could contribute to increasing violence, impunity and a lack of justice in land claims,  said Josinaldo Aleixo, a sociologist with the International Institute of Education in Brazil.  Areas that large are only claimed by big ranchers.

Comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen late on Wednesday signalled that the Fed's rate hikes, which make Central Europe's debt yields relatively less attractive, could be glacial, at best.     Bond yields, which in the past weeks tracked a surge in 10-year Bund yields above 0.5 percent, mostly dropped by a few basis points in the region's main markets.      Hungary fixed its 10-year benchmark yield at 3.09 percent, down 4 basis points.     Regional currencies were mixed, with the forint retreating slightly from off a 4-week high reached against the euro on Wednesday, while the zloty gained 0.1 percent by 1326 GMT.     The Fed comments do not represent a game changer and investors continue to watch the European Central Bank whose hawkish comments boosted bond yields in the region and in the euro zone since late June, one fixed income trader said.      The ECB has been trying to calm markets, but it has become obvious that their loose policy cannot be maintained forever,  the Budapest-based trader said.      While Central European bond yields are mostly higher then euro zone peers, some of the region's markets are also helped by good liquidity. Debt auctions held in Budapest, Bucharest and Prague on Thursday drew robust demand, which pushed yields lower.      The Hungarian central bank has been pumping liquidity into markets via its unorthodox toolkit in the past year.     The government sold 12-month Treasury bills at an average yield of 0.09 percent, down from 0.11 percent at an auction two weeks ago.     A Reuters poll of analysts showed on Thursday that the central bank could keep its record low base rate on hold at least until the end of 2018 and that the 3-month BUBOR rate  could rise only marginally in the next 12 months.      In Romania, large debt redemptions supported government bonds despite worries that the government's policies will lead to a jump in the budget deficit and inflation.     The highest yield at which 19-month bonds were sold at Romania's auction was 1.22 percent, below Wednesday's closing bid of 1.28 percent.     Cash from a Czech Treasury bill redemption in June helped the country sell 8-week bills at a new yield low of -0.4 percent at an auction.

In a statement on Thursday, JBS said it had learned that Brazil's Regional Federal Court of the 1st Region overturned a ruling blocking the $300 million sale of a South American unit to rival Minerva SA (BEEF3.SA). Newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported the news earlier in the day. The regional court also removed any lingering restrictions on JBS to negotiate sales of any assets or operations. On June 21, federal Judge Ricardo Leite blocked JBS's sale of plants in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, saying it could harm a probe against the billionaire Batista family. Efforts to obtain the ruling from the court's media office were not immediately successful. With permission to sell assets, JBS has gained flexibility to downsize amid talks to restructure 18 billion reais ($5.6 billion) in looming loan maturities, which Reuters reported last month. Asset sales could make up for smaller access to credit from state lenders after the scandal involving brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista. Cheap state loans helped fuel growth over the past decade at J&F; Investimentos SA, the Batistas' holding company, which was able to keep control of JBS while expanding into fashion, pulpmaking and banking. Through takeovers, JBS grew from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's Midwest into the world's No. 2 food processor in that time. Record Leniency  Wesley Batista, the older brother, is chief executive officer of São Paulo-based JBS. State development bank BNDES, whose investment arm is JBS's No. 2 shareholder, is demanding his removal. In May, Prosecutor-General Rodigo Janot reached a plea deal with both brothers, who agreed to turn in 1,893 politicians they bribed.  Leite sits on the court that will also review a separate leniency deal that the Batistas reached with prosecutors over their participation in a bribery and graft scheme. The agreement requires the family to pay a record 10.3 billion-real fine over 25 years.  The Batistas have been selling assets to help raise cash to reduce a heavy debt load and pay the fine.  J&F; sold control of the globally popular Havaianas flip-flop brand maker Alpargatas SA (ALPA4.SA) to the investment firms of Brazil's most prominent banking families for 3.5 billion reais ($1.1 billion) late on Wednesday.

Inflows from emerging market investors in the Gulf provided support to the Qatari and the United Arab Emirates stock markets in particular, as they are both linked to the MSCI emerging markets equity index. EM inflows were particularly strong in Qatar, with the stock exchange up by over 2 percent on the day. The Qatari index was at its highest since some of its Arab neighbours severed diplomatic and transport ties with the tiny Gulf state in early June. The undervaluation of the Qatari market in recent weeks led to some movement from the UAE to the Qatari market, given the big gap in valuation between the two exchanges, according to a Qatari fund manager. Qatar Electricity and Water, Vodafone Qatar and Qatar National Bank were the strongest performers in Qatar, with gains of up to 5.6 percent.# Qatar National Bank rose 4.2 percent after the bank reported an almost 3.6 percent increase in its second quarter profits earlier during the week. The Saudi market was slightly up on Thursday, with the Riyadh index 0.18 percent higher day on day. Some companies' results began to come out over the past few days, and they have generally been above expectations. This has given some strength to the Saudi stock market, in particular in the consumer and the financial sector. Banque Saudi Fransi and Al Rajhi Banking & Investment have both increased their dividends’ pay-outs – an unexpected move that lifted the whole banking sector in Saudi Arabia. Al Rahji was up by 1.2 percent on Thursday, while Bank AlJazira was the one registering the highest gains, climbing 2.7 percent day on day. On the consumer side, Jarir Marketing announced on Thursday a net second quarter profit of 157.8 million riyals, confirming expectations of a strong performance by the consumer sector after the Saudi government's decision to reinstate the public sector workers' allowance that had been cut last October because of pressures on the state's coffers. In the United Arab Emirates, the Abu Dhabi stock exchange went up 2.46 percent, while Dubai gained 1.23 percent on Thursday. First Abu Dhabi Bank was up by 3.94 percent on expectations of positive financial results. Union National Bank rose by 3.68 percent on the back of an increase in its second quarter results, as announced by the company earlier this week.

Currently to operate as an EU airline carriers have to be majority owned by EU investors, but it is not clear what EU flying rights will be retained by British airlines after Britain leaves the European Union in March 2019. Many European airlines such as Ryanair (RYA.I), IAG (ICAG.L) and Wizz (WIZZ.L) already have clauses in their articles of association that mean they can force non-EU shareholders to sell their shares in order to ensure that EU investors retain a majority. Dart Group (DTG.L), the parent company of Jet2.com, said on Thursday it planned to change its articles of association to bring it into line with other airlines and thereby help to protect its status and flying rights as a British carrier.    Dart said it would set the permitted maximum of non-British shareholdings at 35 percent, adding it believes that currently, shareholdings by non-British nationals were below that level.  It is not currently known what impact the UK Government's triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and the prospect of the UK leaving the European Union will have on Jet2.com's operating rights, if any,  Dart Group said in a statement.  It may therefore be necessary to review such provisions when the regulatory landscape following Brexit becomes clearer.     European Union rules over ownership are fast emerging as a major point of contention as the aviation industry awaits further clarity on what rules for flying will look like after Brexit. Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary earlier this week told the European Parliament that post-Brexit ownership was a  real issue , and that UK shareholders might be forced to sell shares in the Irish carrier.   At the same hearing IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh described the ownership systems governing airlines as  arcane . Spanish-registered IAG owns British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling and its shares are listed in both London and Spain.  Walsh called on governments to liberalize the rules to allow airlines to be owned by nationals of either Britain or the EU  without the need for complex ownership and control structures being put in place.   But if it needs to be done we will continue as IAG to comply with all rules and regulations,  he added. Dart earlier reported a 14 percent fall in full-year group profits before tax, hit by investments in new Jet2.com bases at Birmingham and London's Stansted airports and foreign currency losses.

In a statement on Thursday, JBS said it had learned that Brazil's Regional Federal Court of the 1st Region overturned a ruling blocking the $300 million sale of a South American unit to rival Minerva SA (BEEF3.SA). Newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported the news earlier in the day. The regional court also removed any lingering restrictions on JBS to negotiate sales of any assets or operations. On June 21, federal Judge Ricardo Leite blocked JBS's sale of plants in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, saying it could harm a probe against the billionaire Batista family. Efforts to obtain the ruling from the court's media office were not immediately successful. With permission to sell assets, JBS has gained flexibility to downsize amid talks to restructure 18 billion reais ($5.6 billion) in looming loan maturities, which Reuters reported last month. Asset sales could make up for smaller access to credit from state lenders after the scandal involving brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista. Cheap state loans helped fuel growth over the past decade at J&F; Investimentos SA, the Batistas' holding company, which was able to keep control of JBS while expanding into fashion, pulpmaking and banking. Through takeovers, JBS grew from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's Midwest into the world's No. 2 food processor in that time. Record Leniency  Wesley Batista, the older brother, is chief executive officer of São Paulo-based JBS. State development bank BNDES, whose investment arm is JBS's No. 2 shareholder, is demanding his removal. In May, Prosecutor-General Rodigo Janot reached a plea deal with both brothers, who agreed to turn in 1,893 politicians they bribed.  Leite sits on the court that will also review a separate leniency deal that the Batistas reached with prosecutors over their participation in a bribery and graft scheme. The agreement requires the family to pay a record 10.3 billion-real fine over 25 years.  The Batistas have been selling assets to help raise cash to reduce a heavy debt load and pay the fine.  J&F; sold control of the globally popular Havaianas flip-flop brand maker Alpargatas SA (ALPA4.SA) to the investment firms of Brazil's most prominent banking families for 3.5 billion reais ($1.1 billion) late on Wednesday.

The 46-year-old Michigan native drew attention on Twitter and his Facebook page to a  Kid Rock '18 for U.S. Senate  website. It featured a photo of the goateed singer-songwriter wearing a leather jacket, dark glasses and white fedora, seated in a plush, star-spangled chair beside a stuffed deer above the tagline:  Are you scared?  The site also displays images of a T-shirt, baseball cap and bumper sticker emblazoned with the campaign logo,  Kid Rock for US Senate  and a box of alternating slogans, including,  In Rock We Trust,   Party to the People  and  You Never Met a Politician Quite Like Me.   I have a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real ... The answer is an absolute YES,  he said on his verified Twitter account.  Stay tuned, I will have a major announcement in the near future.  Reached by email, the musician's spokesman, Kirt Webster, referred only to Rock's Facebook page, which bore the same message. His music label, Warner Bros Records, also posted a website offering sales of Kid Rock for U.S. Senate merchandise. Born Robert James Ritchie in the Detroit suburb of Romeo, Michigan, he rose to fame in 1998 as his debut album  Devil Without a Cause  sold some 14 million copies. He gained additional celebrity through his courtship of actress Pamela Anderson and their brief marriage in the 2000s. FILE PHOTO: Kid Rock inducts rock band Cheap Trick at the 31st annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, U.S. on April 8, 2016.Eduardo Munoz/File PhotoWhile no mention was made in Wednesday's online postings about Rock's political affiliation or in which state he would run, he presumably would seek to challenge Michigan's Democratic incumbent senator, Debbie Stabenow, who is up for re-election in 2018. The Capitol Hill-based newspaper Roll Call reported that Rock's name surfaced as a possible candidate earlier this month during a state Republican Party convention in Michigan, which Trump carried in the 2016 presidential race, though no official decisions were announced. Stabenow seemed to shrug off the prospect of a political challenge from Rock, saying in a Twitter post:  I know we both share a love of music. I concede he's better at playing guitar and I'll keep doing what I do best: fighting for Michigan.  According to Roll Call, Rock endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for president in 2012 and initially supported Ben Carson for the Republican nomination in 2016 but switched to Trump when the former reality-TV star became the party's nominee.

The loonie surged to its highest in more than a year on Wednesday, scoring its biggest gain since March, after the central bank raised interest rates for the first time since 2010.     Chances of another interest rate hike by October have increased to nearly 70 percent from roughly one-in-two before the rate decision, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.                The Canadian dollar has also benefited from comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday, which markets took as a signal the U.S. central bank may go softer with monetary policy tightening than it has previously insisted.     The gap between Canada's 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed on Thursday by 3.7 basis points to a spread of -12.2 basis points, its narrowest since Aug. 4.     At 9:09 a.m. ET (1309 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2760 to the greenback, or 78.37 U.S. cents, down 0.1 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2722 to C$1.2771. It touched on Wednesday its strongest since June 2016 at 1.2681.     Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose even as the International Energy Agency said the oil market could stay oversupplied for longer than expected. U.S. crude        prices were up 0.33 percent at $45.64 a barrel.                  New housing prices in Canada climbed 0.7 percent in May, more than economists' forecasts for a 0.3 percent increase, as prices continued to rise in the hot markets of Toronto and Vancouver, Statistics Canada said.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 7.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.237 percent and the 10-year             falling 40 Canadian cents to yield 1.924 percent.

The Jupiter Express carrying about 35,000 tonnes of diesel loaded from BP's Cherry Point, Washington refinery on June 29 and is currently headed to Botany Bay, New South Wales in Australia, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. BP declined to comment. Australia imports most of its diesel requirements from Singapore, South Korea and Japan but several refineries undergoing maintenance and prompt demand from India has tightened supply of the fuel in Asia, traders said.  The decision was (likely) made due to far east premium strength, Singapore (cash premium) strength versus bringing a vessel down,  a trader with a North Asian refiner said. The cash differential for diesel with 10-parts-per-million (ppm) sulphur, a grade imported by Australia, rose to a six-month high in early July, Reuters data showed. GO10-SIN-DIF BP last shipped diesel from the United States to Australia in December, a shipbroker said, though such cargo movements were unheard of before that. United States usually ships most of its diesel exports to Europe than Asia due to cheaper freight rates, traders said. But a rise in Singapore cash premiums for diesel has attracted the unusual reverse arbitrage flow of diesel from Europe to Asia, they added. BP has chartered the long-range Nan Lin Wan and Front Antares tankers for loading out of the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage and refining hub in mid-July, headed to Asia, traders and shipbrokers said. This could also be prompting the unusual flow of diesel cargo from the United States to Australia, the traders added.  I think going forward, it's going to be more and more common to see this kind of reverse flows as Asian demand for oil products like jet fuel and diesel is growing phenomenally,  a Singapore-based trader said. But the unusual diesel imports could ease in the third quarter as refineries are expected to return from maintenance and as India's imports of the fuel taper off due to the start of monsoon rains which typically reduce the need of the fuel in irrigation pumps.

Currently to operate as an EU airline carriers have to be majority owned by EU investors, but it is not clear what EU flying rights will be retained by British airlines after Britain leaves the European Union in March 2019. Many European airlines such as Ryanair (RYA.I), IAG (ICAG.L) and Wizz (WIZZ.L) already have clauses in their articles of association that mean they can force non-EU shareholders to sell their shares in order to ensure that EU investors retain a majority. Dart Group (DTG.L), the parent company of Jet2.com, said on Thursday it planned to change its articles of association to bring it into line with other airlines and thereby help to protect its status and flying rights as a British carrier.    Dart said it would set the permitted maximum of non-British shareholdings at 35 percent, adding it believes that currently, shareholdings by non-British nationals were below that level.  It is not currently known what impact the UK Government's triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and the prospect of the UK leaving the European Union will have on Jet2.com's operating rights, if any,  Dart Group said in a statement.  It may therefore be necessary to review such provisions when the regulatory landscape following Brexit becomes clearer.     European Union rules over ownership are fast emerging as a major point of contention as the aviation industry awaits further clarity on what rules for flying will look like after Brexit. Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary earlier this week told the European Parliament that post-Brexit ownership was a  real issue , and that UK shareholders might be forced to sell shares in the Irish carrier.   At the same hearing IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh described the ownership systems governing airlines as  arcane . Spanish-registered IAG owns British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling and its shares are listed in both London and Spain.  Walsh called on governments to liberalize the rules to allow airlines to be owned by nationals of either Britain or the EU  without the need for complex ownership and control structures being put in place.   But if it needs to be done we will continue as IAG to comply with all rules and regulations,  he added. Dart earlier reported a 14 percent fall in full-year group profits before tax, hit by investments in new Jet2.com bases at Birmingham and London's Stansted airports and foreign currency losses.

We do not expect this trend to significantly affect sector profitability in the near term. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has applied for judicial review regarding a recently introduced additional price negotiation process for new drugs that are expected to cost the NHS more than GBP20 million a year, whether due to high unit costs, or high volumes. The new threshold adds another barrier to access in the UK market, affecting drugs that have been deemed cost effective by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) but whose introduction would have an immediate negative budget impact. NICE estimates that about one in five new treatments could be affected by the threshold, which drug producers view as arbitrary. We expect stretched public-health budgets in developed countries to result in further pricing disputes as the combination of pressure on public spending, ageing populations, improving access to health care and an increase in chronic diseases means underlying cost trends appear unsustainable. Health care buyers are therefore focusing more on the value that a drug offers to the healthcare system as a whole and pharmaceutical companies are adjusting their pricing structures. The traditional pricing model focused on setting a risk-adjusted return premium on the development and marketing costs for a drug with a view to maximising volume and market share. But new models take account of more factors, including the efficacy of the drug and its value for patients, the potential for savings elsewhere in the healthcare system, for example through reduced hospitalisation rates, and a risk and innovation premium for the drug maker that is sufficient to foster R&D.; In this environment pharma companies with targeted R&D; pipelines, such as Novartis, Roche and Amgen, and those offering real innovation will be best positioned to retain strong pricing power. But there is still likely to be an increase in costs from additional clinical trials and the extra expense of gathering underlying data to support pricing. Pharma companies will probably move further away from the traditional all in-house model of drug development and production to mitigate these cost pressures. They are likely to rely more on outsourcing, which can achieve better economies of scale in both manufacturing and clinical trials.

Still, the latest reading on the producer price index (PPI) did not alter the perception that underlying inflation remains muted with little evidence of wage pressure despite a firm labor market. The recent decline in oil prices due to concerns about global oversupply has also caused traders and policymakers to become more uncertain about when price growth would accelerate.  With major moves in prices at the producer level necessary to spark significant shifts in prices at the consumer level, we do not believe there is any cause for concern whatsoever (in either direction) from recent PPI data nor in all likelihood from what lays ahead,  Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc, wrote in a research note. The Labor Department said earlier on Thursday the PPI for final demand rose 0.1 percent in June after being unchanged in May. Analysts had forecast the index to remain unchanged last month. However, the PPI increased 2.0 percent on a 12-month basis, weaker than the 2.4 percent gain in May. At 9:12 a.m. (1312 GMT), the 10-year inflation breakeven rate, or the yield difference between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and regular 10-year Treasury notes, was 1.77 percent, up 0.7 basis point from Wednesday, according to Tradeweb and Reuters data.

They've also been mobbed by angry voters and confronted by men offended that their wives are being interviewed instead of them. The work of political pollsters is still widely misunderstood in Kenya, with international companies like Ipsos accused of everything from corruption to making children sick.   We have had to airlift people out before,  said Hilda Kiritu, head of public relations for Ipsos's Kenya office, as she listed her colleagues' travails.  Kenyans are preparing to elect their next president, lawmakers and local representatives on Aug. 8, with incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta seeking a second five-year term and veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga determined to unseat him. As campaign rhetoric heats up, hostility toward pollsters has erupted again. The latest Ipsos poll showing the presidential race may go to a second round sparked angry denunciations and threats on social media.   There's a lot of people who believe polling is not scientific, that everything has a price tag,  Aggrey Oriwo, managing director at Ipsos Kenya, told Reuters.  They don't understand there are a lot of checks and balances.  Kenyan elections are traditionally tight but there has never been a run-off. President Mwai Kibaki won in 2007 by 232,000 votes; in 2013, Kenyatta avoided a run-off by just 8,100 votes.  Both times, irregularities marred the elections and the opposition alleged rigging. In 2007, protests sparked widespread ethnic violence that killed around 1,200 people. In 2013, Odinga took his challenge to court. Protests were mostly peaceful.  A close race and eroding trust in public institutions are two of the most closely-watched indicators of potential violence. Ipsos polls show worrying trends for both.  The latest Ipsos survey of 2,026 Kenyans, released last month, showed 48 percent supported incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta, seeking a second and final five-year term. Forty-two percent supported veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga. Two percent refused to say and eight percent were undecided.  The sampling error was plus or minus 2.18 percent.  The winner needs one vote more than 50 percent of the national total, with at least a quarter of the vote in 24 of the 47 counties.  Trust in institutions has increased overall, but it's split along partisan lines: 79 percent of Kenyatta supporters trust the electoral board, but only 43 percent of Odinga's supporters.  Aggrey Oriwo, managing director at Ipsos Kenya, speaks during a Reuters interview in his office in Nairobi, Kenya July 12, 2017.Katharine HoureldLess than half of all Kenyans said they would trust the presidential result and only 39 percent said they trust the courts. That may be dip further when the next survey comes out this month. On Sunday, Kenyatta angrily attacked a high court decision he said favored the opposition. Kish Grids and Smartphones Voters' faith in pollsters has slipped globally after polls failed to predict a majority of people in Britain would vote to leave the European Union or that Donald Trump would win the presidential election in the United States.  Who are these aliens you claim to take opinions from?  is one of the more polite comments on the Ipsos Kenya Facebook page.  Ipsos made a Swahili-speaking American, Tom Wolf, its public face in Kenya to dampen accusations of ethnic bias. The price of fame means that he has twice had to flee angry mobs and is often surrounded by voters demanding their views be heard.  Politicians have called for his deportation, threatened to sue Ipsos over defamation and complained to its Paris headquarters, saying their work is biased.  It's not just Kenyans who have a problem with pollsters, Wolf said. After Trump denounced polls during his presidential campaign, some of his supporters stopped responding to them, possibly helping skew results in the United States, he said.  America is becoming more like Kenya every day,  he said with a wry smile. Ipsos tries to counter doubters by explaining how its methodology is designed to ensure representative sampling. For its quarterly survey, computers send pollsters to 200 locations around the country, randomly chosen to reflect population density. They visit urban slums and remote deserts bordering Somalia.  A computer program ensures randomness in the selection of households by telling pollsters to pass a certain number of homes before stopping. After the pollster lists everyone inside over the age of 18, the person to be surveyed is chosen using a kish grid, a table widely used in international research.  A smartphone records the interview, answers, time and exact location. For questions on presidential candidates, interviewees enter answers on the phone so the interviewer can't see them.  We are trying to remove the element of human error,  Oriwo said, and added the most important thing is to accurately reflect voters' concerns, so their leaders can listen.

The parents of 11-month-old Charlie Gard have been fighting a legal battle to send their son for the experimental therapy, but Britain's courts have refused permission on the grounds it would prolong his suffering without any realistic prospect of it helping. Charlie suffers from a form of mitochondrial disease, a rare genetic condition causing progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. Last week, London's world-renowned Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, where Charlie is being treated, asked for a new hearing in light of international offers of treatment after  U.S. President Donald Trump and the pope brought the case to worldwide attention.  If there is important new evidence that suggests my decision should be changed then I will change it,  judge Nicholas Francis told the hearing at London's High Court. In a statement issued before the hearing, Connie Yates and Chris Gard said they loved their son  more than life itself .  If he's still fighting, we're still fighting,  they said. However, the couple later stormed angrily out of the hearing after the judge said they had agreed that Charlie's life without any medical improvement was not worth sustaining.  We have said he's not suffering, he's not in pain,  Yates said. Francis initially ruled against the parents in April, and his decision was supported by Britain's Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. The European Court of Human Rights also upheld the ruling that a trip to the United States would cause unnecessary suffering. Lawyers for the parents need to persuade the judge that new evidence has come to light that means he should review his original verdict.  What I can't do ... is reopen issues that already have been dealt with, not only be me, but by the Court of Appeal,  he said. He told the court he would not give his final decision on Thursday, but said it was important it was given as soon as possible.

But this is not just any queue. This is The Queue. Tens of thousands of fanatics become part of the world famous tournament every year, as they line the streets and parkways of this south-west London suburb in the hope of gaining access to the grounds. For the first nine days of the tournament, organizers hold back 500 Centre Court tickets for general sale at the turnstile. The club also sells about 500 tickets for Court One each day, and another 500 for Court Two  for as many days as a full programme of matches can be maintained . The Queue now boasts its own Twitter account offering updates and the latest details to a following of more than 9,000 people. On arrival at the queue, hopefuls are handed a Queue Card, their proof of position, along with a 29-page guide advising on the ticketing rules and regulations: you cannot buy tickets for another person, for example. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 3, 2017   Spectators during the Wimbledon queueStefan WermuthThese days up to 10,000 cards are issued and some fans camp for days to get into a particular match, often days in advance. Annie Smith is a regular at The Queue. Her reason is straightforward:  Well, we want tickets,  she said. Slideshow (3 Images)But the line has become more than just gaining entry, and is now an experience in itself, according to 27-year-old Alisha.  The tennis is fun but the whole experience of waiting in a crowd of exited tennis fans makes it a whole lot better,  she said. Wimbledon is increasingly unusual in allowing on-the-day sales. Most other sporting events have moved entirely online, but some say this system results in a purer turnout of committed tennis fans.      Anyone can go online with a credit card and buy a ticket, and some might not even turn up if the weather is not great, or the match-up they had hoped for doesn't work out,  said Marty Paintman as he queued.  But people like us who queue up, we are committed - we are here because we really, really want to see the tennis. And that is the sort of atmosphere you want in the crowds, and the sort of fans you want to reward.  It makes for a better atmosphere all round.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, state police and five local police departments have now joined the search for the four men, aged 19 to 22, and suspect that foul play is involved, said Bucks County District Attorney Mark Weintraub. Bolstered by 40 police cadets, the search has focused on a sprawling 90-acre property in Solebury, Pennsylvania, located about 45 miles north of Philadelphia, owned by the parents of Cosmo Dinardo, 20, who was charged with stealing a car owned by Thomas Meo, one of the missing men, Weintraub said in a news conference.  We have not recovered any human remains that I can report,  Weintraub said.  We are going to keep searching that property until we are satisfied that they are not there.  He also said that the police had found some evidence they considered important, but declined to provide details. The four missing men are Jimi Patrick, 19, of Newtown Township; Mark Sturgis, 22, of Pennsburg; Dean Finocchiaro, 19, of Middletown Township; and Meo, 21, of Plumstead Township. Patrick has been missing since last Wednesday and the others since Friday. Dinardo had been arrested earlier in the week for owning a gun he was not allowed to posses under state law because he had previous been involuntarily committed in a mental health facility, prosecutors said. He was released following that arrest after his father posted a bond.

The banks were placed in liquidation under an Italian government law decree passed on 25 June 2017. Certain assets and liabilities are being sold to Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP), including customer deposits, senior bonds, performing loans, branches and staff, but not equity or subordinated bonds. Vicenza and Veneto are frequent originators of structured finance deals, with 19 outstanding transactions in the Berica, Claris and Apulia series rated by Fitch. We assess set-off risk, which arises if a borrower invokes a right to set off losses on deposits and bond holdings against debt they owe to a bank, as part of our initial rating analysis. We estimate that the average set-off exposure from borrowers holding both senior and subordinated bank debt was less than 0.8% of the portfolio balance at closing. With senior debt protected from losses, and few securitised borrowers holding the affected subordinated bonds, the potential loss is covered by credit enhancement, which is rising as the transactions amortise. The average percentage of loans exposed to set-off is higher in the two SME CLO transactions (1.2%) than in the 17 RMBS deals (0.7%) we rate, as Italian SMEs often invest their liquidity in bank debt. Set-off exposure in new RMBS deals has been falling since 2013. It may also have fallen over time in more seasoned deals as some bonds will have matured and some loans been partly or fully repaid or defaulted since closing. For example, no subordinated debt issued by the two banks before 2007 remains outstanding. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogram.com/veneto_bank_rmbs_set_off_exposure?src=embe d  title= Veneto Bank RMBS Set-Off Exposure  width= 550  height= 643  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > The already low set-off risk from subordinated debt will significantly reduce, especially in the RMBS transactions, as the Italian government and ISP will allocate funds to the repayment of the subordinated bonds placed with retail customers after the banks' acquisition. If the decree law receives parliamentary approval and the transfer of bank branches proceeds as planned, there should be no servicing discontinuity risk resulting from the banks' liquidation. ISP will start servicing the Vicenza- and Veneto-originated sub-pools, while Banca Nuova (formerly part of the Vicenza group) and BancApulia (formerly part of Veneto) will continue servicing their originated sub-portfolios. All the transactions also have cash reserves covering payment interruption risk on the notes and most have back-up servicers. We tested the effect of a potential servicer disruption in our latest rating analysis and found that payment interruption risk would be mitigated for at least three months in each deal, and for six months in most of them. Commingling risk is mitigated through adequate reserves or available credit enhancement. We calculate the average commingling exposure as equal to 1.7% for RMBS transactions and 3.3% for SME CLOs. If the liquidated banks buy back the non-performing loans up to the liquidation date, (as happened after UBI Banca's acquisition of three smaller banks from the state bank resolution fund), issuers' near-term cash flows could increase by an amount up to the value of the defaulted loans. The impact would vary depending on the transactions' structural features, whether excess spread is trapped or not, and the repurchase price.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Then they knocked down my house.  Outside the wreckage of his home, neighbors also say they were forced out by military police at the behest of a powerful local rancher who wanted the land.    Activists say impunity for powerful ranchers in remote regions like the Amazon, coupled with the growing power of Brazil's farm lobby in congress, is fuelling land violence. At least 200 people were killed in land disputes in 2016, up from 185 in 2015, according to Global Witness, making it the bloodiest year on record with 60 percent of killings in Latin America. Maristela Lopes da Silva, an activist with the Rural Workers Union in Boca do Acre, a Brazilian advocacy group which supports smallholder farmers during land conflicts, said violence is rising because of inequality and impunity.    Here, the law only belongs to the powerful,  da Silva told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a wooden house which serves as the Workers' Union headquarters in Boca do Acre.      As well as Conceicao and his neighbors in the last six months, more than 200 households have been displaced in Boca do Acre, a municipality with about 30,000 residents, da Silva said.   The government only issues measures to favor big ranchers,  she said.  While Global Witness recorded 49 land-related killings in Brazil last year, local rights groups put the number at about 61 - with 2017 set to be worse, according to the Pastoral Land Commission, an advocacy group linked to the Catholic Church.  Ongoing Investigations    Brazilian prosecutors say they are investigating the evictions of Conceicao and his neighbors as part of an effort to crackdown on land violence. Having security forces knock down houses without prior warning and not allowing residents to remove their possessions is unlawful, said federal prosecutor Fernando Soave. If the rancher did have a legitimate claim to the land where Conceicao and the others were living then evictions still are not supposed to happen until there has been a public meeting between the conflicted parties, the prosecutor said.   There are a lot of illegal (evictions) happening in this region,  Soave told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  But he said he feared that if local authorities could not reduce conflicts, large farm operators in the region will form  armed militias  - as they have in other rural areas - to drive smallholder farmers from the land. Local security forces say they acted lawfully in destroying Conceicao's home and impunity for big ranchers is not a major problem in the region.   We would never abuse our authority, I would never put my career at risk,  Lieutenant Miqueias Mariano de Oliveira, who led operations in the area, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  He said conflicts in the area are due to small farmers like Conceicao  invading  land that belongs to large operators.  The rancher is the victim. There is an increasing risk of confrontation from invaders against owners and death in the region,  Oliveira said.  Conceicao and his neighbors said they had a claim to the land, although they did not have full formal ownership over the property - a common problem in rural Brazil where most farmers do not have complete title deeds to the land they work.    They said we are land invaders, but it's not true,  said evicted corn grower Aureolindo Nascimento Barbosa, 47. The rancher could not be reached for comment.  Analysts believe new measures signed by Brazilian President Michel Temer this week will further stoke land violence. These include measures to allow rural property owners to regularize up to 2,500 hectares of public land if they have been farming it, up from the current 1,500 hectares.  Critics say the rule will allow large farmers to claim swathes of land occupied by smallholder farmers like Conceicao. Supporters of the changes say they will help farmers formally register their properties, making it easier for authorities to track who owns land and reducing conflicts.   The new limit of 2,500 hectares could contribute to increasing violence, impunity and a lack of justice in land claims,  said Josinaldo Aleixo, a sociologist with the International Institute of Education in Brazil.  Areas that large are only claimed by big ranchers.

France and Germany had led efforts to create the tax, which was supposed to help recover public funds used to bail out banks in the financial crisis and to curb speculative trading.  But the talks have dragged on since 2011 as countries struggle to agree what instruments should be covered and at which rate. Banks and other opponents of the tax argue that it only makes sense if it covers many countries or else transactions will shift towards financial centers not covered by it. Macron said that he would  go all the way  on the tax, adding:  I am in no way pulling back on this subject  after some EU lawmakers and NGOs accused him of just that. However, he added that it depended on whether Britain had access to EU financial markets after Brexit, because otherwise firms would move to London where the tax will not apply.  I want an FTT that can be applied in a coherent space, makes sense and is effective,  Macron told Ouest France newspaper.  Ten countries - Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Greece, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain - have signed up in principle for the tax. A minimum of nine is needed under EU rules. Macron's government is pushing hard to attract finance jobs from London and promised last week to axe an tax on intra-day financial transactions that lawmakers added to the last budget bill, much to the fury of French finance firms.

Yellen's comments were part of her two-day semi-annual monetary policy testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. She will resume her testimony at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). Investor cheered Yellen's view of gradual increase in rates on Wednesday, with world shares hitting their fourth all-time high in less than a month on Thursday. The Dow rose to a record high close while U.S. stocks kept their upward momentum on Wednesday following Yellen's comments. The U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, though low inflation and a low neutral rate may leave the central bank with diminished leeway, Yellen said. The U.S. economy grew at a  slight to moderate  pace over the last several weeks across all regions of the country, with wage pressures reported for both low- and high-skilled jobs, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday in its latest compendium of regional economic activity.  Her speech was labeled as dovish due to no signs of any aggressive rate hikes or having a firm plan in relation to scaling down their balance sheet,  said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK. Dow e-minis were up 11 points, or 0.05 percent, with 15,283 contracts changing hands at 8:40 a.m. ET (1240 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were up 2.75 points, or 0.11 percent, with 121,088 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 11.25 points, or 0.19 percent, on volume of 29,954 contracts. Data showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly rose in June as sustained increases in the cost of services offset declining energy prices, suggesting a recent moderation in inflation was likely temporary. In the 12 months through June the producer level inflation, or PPI, increased 2.0 percent, above the 1.9 percent rise expected. Data from the U.S. Labor Department showed jobless claims falling last week for the first time in a month. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped to 247,000 for the week ended July 8, from 248,000. On the stocks, Delta shares were down 1.3 percent in premarket trading, after the No.2 U.S. airline's quarterly profit missed analysts' expectations. Target rose 5.5 percent after the retailer said it expects a  modest  increase in second-quarter comparable sales, the first rise in five quarters. Yandex jumped 21 percent after the company and Uber agreed to combine their Russian ride-sharing businesses.

National prices rose 0.7 percent, topping economists' forecasts for a 0.3 percent increase. The new housing price index excludes apartments and condominiums. The data came the day after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years, which will make borrowing costs more expensive for consumers. Some have blamed years of low interest rates for fueling Canada's long housing boom. Home prices in Toronto, Canada's largest city, jumped 1.1 percent as builders cited a shortage of developed land and higher construction costs, as well as market conditions. Still, that marked a modest slowdown from April's 2.1 percent increase. A foreign buyers tax and other measures that the Ontario government implemented in late April to rein in the Toronto housing market have weighed on sales in recent months. In Vancouver, where the provincial government put its own foreign buyers tax in place last summer, prices rose 2.2 percent, the largest increase since May 2007.

Lacklustre gasoline demand growth, particularly in the United States, and fears of a repeat of last year's poor summer gasoline profits, led refineries in the Atlantic Basin to skew their yields in favour of distillates, by running heavier oil. Strong profits for fuel oil has also encouraged refineries to run sour crudes. This has compounded supply cuts, which were concentrated in heavier oils, to keep sulphur-rich crudes, normally shunned for lighter, easier-to-process alternatives, at the top of the heap. Since OPEC-organised cuts began siphoning some 1.8 million bpd from the market in January – nearly all of it medium and heavy oil – the so-called  heavy  or  sour  grades have become the most sought-after barrels. Normally, refineries would snap up easier to process light grades before the summer, when they aim to run the gasoline-rich crude so they can sell the fuel to holidaying drivers. But now, in the middle of July, sour grades are still so sought after that differentials are hitting multi-year highs.  Sour grades are like gold dust at the moment,  one oil trader said.  There's a need to fill in more sour grades heading to the U.S. and there is huge demand from the East.  Differentials for Urals, a sour grade exported from the Baltics and the Black Sea, are trading at their highest level versus dated Brent in two years, while light grades nearby such as CPC Blend and Azeri are at two-year lows. North Sea Ekofisk, a light crude coveted for its high gasoline yield, is also trading at its largest discount to sour Forties in two years, as are differentials for Angola's Cabinda. Despite a summer slowdown in loadings for China, a key buyer of Angolan oil, U.S. and Indian loadings rose to their highest in roughly a year, according to Reuters tracking.  It's an oversupplied sweet market, but a tight medium and heavy sour market,  said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of crude oil and refined products at Resource Economist Ltd. Most of the oversupply – including millions of barrels from Libya and Nigeria which are exempt from the OPEC production cuts, and output from U.S. shale – is light crude oil. At the same time new and sophisticated refineries in India and China – designed to run sulphur-rich crudes – are ramping up production. India's IOC bought its first sour crude oil cargo from the U.S. last week. Ul-Haq added that since refineries are poised to start producing heating oil for winter demand, refineries could look for even more sour oils, threatening more tightness. Still, Ul-Haq added, the sour premiums are limited comfort to those selling the oil, including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Angola.  The Saudis should be happier than Nigerians but a price below $60 per barrel is still a headache,  he said. Benchmark Brent crude was below $48 a barrel on Thursday.

Untertuerkheim is operating at full capacity. But the 19,000 workers at the plant demanded assurances that jobs would be guaranteed as the auto industry shifts to electric cars, which have fewer components than diesel or gasoline vehicles. Workers at Untertuerkheim went on strike this month, leading to the cancellation of overtime shifts to make the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class model and forcing the management into talks. As part of the deal, Untertuerkheim will become a competence center for integrating the electric powertrain into production, and will include a battery production facility, in addition to battery plants in Kamenz and Beijing.  The agreement created more than 250 new jobs in the field of electric vehicle production, Daimler said. Powertrain modules for electric vehicles will be assembled in Untertuerkheim and supplied to other locations like the Mercedes-Benz passenger car plant in Sindelfingen.   With this further development, Untertuerkheim will continue to be the lead plant in the global powertrain production network,  Mercedes-Benz cars production chief Markus Schaefer said. The labor pact includes changes to the plant's shifts and flexible workforce measures, as well as assurances that Mercedes-Benz will develop Untertuerkheim into a competence center to test electric-drive prototypes.   We are getting a project house in which experts from our research and development department will develop know-how for the electric drive systems of future EQ models,” Wolfgang Nieke, chairman of Untertuerkheim's works council, said in a statement. By 2025, fully electric vehicles are to account for between 15 and 25 percent of the total unit sales of Mercedes-Benz.

The legislation was presented to parliament without discussion in the first stage of what is expected to be a long and divisive debate about the nature of Britain's EU exit, during which the contents of the bill can be amended.  The passage of the bill will test Prime Minister Theresa May's ability to lead the country. It must be agreed by both houses of parliament before it can come into effect. The first debate is not expected to start until at least September. The bill can be viewed here:  here Below is a summary of what the bill, formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, proposes: Repeal the European Communities Act The bill states this will happen on the day that Britain leaves the EU. It does not specify a date. Expected to be the most straightforward part of the legislation, the Brexit department said this would  remove supremacy of EU law and return control to the UK . It will stop new EU laws being automatically applicable to Britain and ensure subsequent British legislation trumps old EU laws. Convert Eu Law Into Uk Law  The government's aim is to maximize legal continuity as Britain leaves the EU, ensuring that wherever possible the same rules and laws apply on the day after Brexit as they did on the day before. This is seen as a necessary step to allow businesses and courts to continue to function. Regulations Some EU laws, known as regulations, are currently automatically applicable to Britain without having required  domestic laws to be passed. Some other pieces of EU legislation work in the same way.   Therefore the bill states they will all need to be translated into domestic law so they still apply at the point at which Britain leaves the EU.  The interpretation of those laws, as defined in previous cases, will also be brought into British law to ensure the way the rules are applied in practice does not change.  There is a provision in the bill to allow the Supreme Court to depart from the EU case law in some instances. Directives Other EU laws, known as directives, are already incorporated into British law. The underlying directives, therefore, do not require transferral, Nor do obligations required by EU treaties which Britain has already incorporated into British law. Powers to Correct Laws During Transfer Some laws will cease to function correctly if they are copied across verbatim or left as they currently stand. This could be for a number of reasons. For example, if they refer to an EU regulator which no longer has jurisdiction in Britain. To achieve the government's aim of legal consistency, these laws will need to be amended to make them work properly. The repeal bill sets out that these changes will be made through an existing parliamentary process known as 'secondary legislation'. Secondary legislation still requires parliamentary oversight, and ministers will not be given the power to unilaterally change laws. The government estimates that 800 to a 1,000 such changes will need to be made. The bill states that these powers can only be used to correct deficiencies arising from Britain's withdrawal for the EU. This means they cannot be used to enact changes in government policy.

The Labor Department said on Thursday its producer price index for final demand ticked up 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in May.  In the 12 months through June the PPI increased 2.0 percent, slowing after May's 2.4 percent advance as last year's energy-driven rise drops out of the calculation. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI being unchanged last month and rising 1.9 percent from a year ago. Federal Reserve officials are closely watching inflation, which has remained below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target for five years. They have largely viewed the recent retreat in price pressures as transitory.  Labor market strength is expected to encourage the Fed to raise interest rates in December for a third time this year and announce in September a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.   Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday that the economy was healthy enough for the central bank to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio.  Last month, prices for services gained 0.2 percent, accounting for almost 80 percent of the increase in the PPI. Services were lifted by a 0.3 percent rise in the index for final demand trade services, excluding transportation and warehousing. It was the fourth straight monthly increase in services and followed a 0.3 percent gain in May.  The cost of healthcare services were unchanged after dipping 0.1 percent in May. Those costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index.   Energy prices fell 0.5 percent after declining 3.0 percent in May. Food prices jumped 0.6 percent in June following a 0.2 percent drop the prior month. A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services increased 0.2 percent last month. The so-called core PPI fell 0.1 percent in May. The core PPI increased 2.0 percent in the 12 months through June after climbing 2.1 percent in May.

Oger, Turk Telekom's top shareholder, missed debt repayments of $290 million in both September and March. Oger is a unit of Saudi Arabian construction giant Saudi Oger, which itself is facing a multi-billion dollar debt restructuring. The Turkish government has stepped in and asked some banks to find prospective buyers for the stake, the sources said, declining to be identified because the information is not public. The government, which owns 30 percent of Turk Telekom, wants the operator of the national telecoms grid to be owned by a financially stable company, the sources said. Two overseas investors have expressed interest in the stake, which is worth about $3.3 billion, and the sale could be completed by end-September, the sources said. A representative for Oger's Turkish unit declined to comment, as did the Turkish Treasury and Turk Telekom. Although the government has the final word on changes in Turk Telekom's ownership, Oger's creditors also have a say in any potential sale, as it pledged the Telekom shares as collateral when it took the loan as part of a 2013 debt refinancing. There are around 30 creditor banks, including Turkey's Akbank, with $1.5 billion of exposure, and Garanti with $951 million of exposure, according to bank filings. Isbank, Turkey's largest listed lender, has 1.9 billion lira ($532 million) worth of exposure. Owned by the family of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Saudi Oger has been hit as the decline in oil prices led to sharp state spending cuts in the kingdom, weighing on big contractors. No one was immediately available for comment at Hariri's office. Shares of Turk Telekom were up 2.4 percent at 6.36 lira in afternoon trade, outpacing a 0.77 percent rise in Istanbul's BIST 100 stock index.

Kenya The Kenyan shilling could weaken against the dollar in the coming week as food and oil importers and retail firms rush to buy hard currency and beef up their positions ahead of the election, traders said. At 1000 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 103.95/104.05 per dollar, compared with 103.65/85 at last Thursday's close.  We're seeing demand across the board, different sectors looking to buy (dollars), with a few weeks to elections,  a trader from a leading commercial bank said. Kenyans are due to go to the polls on Aug. 8 to elect the next president and legislators. Ghana Ghana's cedi is seen fairly stable against the dollar in the coming days as a favourable third quarter economic outlook spurs renewed investor confidence, analysts said. The local unit was trading at 4.4050 per dollar by mid-morning on Thursday, compared with 4.3900 a week ago.  Q3 is likely to see a fairly stable cedi amidst planned bond issues, falling inflation, and a relatively not-strong demand for the greenback,  Joseph Biggles Amponsah, analyst at Accra-based Dortis Research, said. Nigeria The Nigerian naira is expected to hold steady as dollar supplies improve on the back of more offshore investors returning to the Africa's biggest economy. The local currency was quoted flat at 368 to the dollar on the black market on Thursday, while commercial lenders traded it at 305.95 to the dollar in the interbank market against 306.2 a dollar last week. At the investor forex window, the naira was quoted at 365.34 per dollar on Thursday. Nigeria's currency window for investors and exporters was established on April 24 and it has traded more than $3.83 billion. Traders said the window had spurred a gradual return of confidence in the OPEC member country's economy.  We have seen increased dollar inflows(s) from offshore investors into the economy ... this has helped stabilise the currency market,  one senior currency trader told Reuters. Tanzania The Tanzanian shilling will trade stable against the dollar in the days ahead, helped by inflows from firms in the tourism sector. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,233/2,243 to the dollar on Thursday, stronger than 2,238/2,243 a week ago. A trader at CRDB Bank said there were  inflows from tourism .  The shilling will probably remain stable next week, unless there is a spike in demand for the U.S. currency,  he said. Uganda The Uganda shilling is seen trading in a stable range, partly helped by possible inflows from offshore investors seeking to take up government debt after the central bank started auctions for 2017/18 fiscal year this month. At 1009 GMT commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,600/3,610, compared to last Thursday's close of 3,598/3,608.  Some inflows might come in from there,  Benon Okwenje, trader at  Stanbic Bank said, referring to offshore investors. Uganda's fiscal year starts in July and ends in June and the first Treasury auction for this year was on July 5. Okwenje said the shilling will likely play in the 3,600-3,615 range over the next one week.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000 for the week ended July 8, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 123 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent. The drop in first-time applications for jobless benefits came on the heels of data last week showing the economy created 222,000 jobs last month, the second biggest payrolls increase this year. Labor market buoyancy could persuade the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates for a third time this year by December, despite inflation continuing to stubbornly run below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. The Fed's survey of the economy published on Wednesday showed  labor markets tightened further for both low and high-skilled positions, particularly in the construction and IT sectors.  Economists expect the Fed will announce in September a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 245,750 last week. A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data and that no states had been estimated. Claims tend to be volatile around this time of the year when automakers normally shut assembly plants for annual retooling. In recent years some automakers kept production lines running to meet strong demand. With auto sales declining and inventories rising, some companies like General Motors are extending their summer shutdowns. Economists say this could throw off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 20,000 to 1.95 million in the week ended July 1. The so-called continuing claims have now been below 2 million for 13 straight weeks, pointing to shrinking labor market slack. The four-week moving average of continuing claims rose 2,250 to 1.95 million, remaining below the 2 million mark for 11 consecutive weeks.

Untertuerkheim is operating at full capacity. But the 19,000 workers at the plant demanded assurances that jobs would be guaranteed as the auto industry shifts to electric cars, which have fewer components than diesel or gasoline vehicles. Workers at Untertuerkheim went on strike this month, leading to the cancellation of overtime shifts to make the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class model and forcing the management into talks. As part of the deal, Untertuerkheim will become a competence center for integrating the electric powertrain into production, and will include a battery production facility, in addition to battery plants in Kamenz and Beijing.  The agreement created more than 250 new jobs in the field of electric vehicle production, Daimler said. Powertrain modules for electric vehicles will be assembled in Untertuerkheim and supplied to other locations like the Mercedes-Benz passenger car plant in Sindelfingen.   With this further development, Untertuerkheim will continue to be the lead plant in the global powertrain production network,  Mercedes-Benz cars production chief Markus Schaefer said. The labor pact includes changes to the plant's shifts and flexible workforce measures, as well as assurances that Mercedes-Benz will develop Untertuerkheim into a competence center to test electric-drive prototypes.   We are getting a project house in which experts from our research and development department will develop know-how for the electric drive systems of future EQ models,” Wolfgang Nieke, chairman of Untertuerkheim's works council, said in a statement.

OW Bunker filed for bankruptcy in Denmark in November 2014 after losses at its Singapore business Dynamic Oil Trading, a marked change of fortunes for a firm valued at $1 billion when it listed in March that year. The prosecutor said the former manager, a Danish citizen, has been charged with committing fraud of agent by granting credit outside his mandate worth more than 800 million Danish crowns ($123 million). The prosecutor did not wish to name the defendant but said no reporting restrictions had been imposed. The former head of Dynamic Oil Trading was Lars Moller. His lawyer, Arvid Andersen, could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday for comment. Andersen told Danish publication Shippingwatch on Thursday that there had been no criminal activity, reiterating what he has previously told Reuters. The prosecutor said it had not found any legal grounds for the criminal prosecution of other members of management within the OW Bunker group.  In Singapore, this manager of the subsidiary has single-handed committed these credit exaggerations,  state prosecutor for serious economic and international crime, Niels Vejlby Hansen, told Reuters.  There had been several suspects in the mother company but our investigation shows that this has happened in the subsidiary,  he said. The bankruptcy of OW Bunker sent shockwaves through the global shipping industry and left investors and business partners scrambling to cover their losses. Hansen said claims for damages could be put forward as part of the trial though the judge could reject claims if they became  too complicated  and instead refer the matter to a civil court. A group of 26 institutional investors, including two of the largest pension funds in Denmark, ATP and PFA, is also waging a legal campaign against the former management of OW Bunker for allegedly misleading them in its 2014 initial public offering. One PFA executive said he did not think Thursday's decisions by the state prosecutor affected their legal battle.  I don't think it weakens our case, if he is sentenced or imprisoned. On the contrary, we think there is a civil responsibility, and that is what we're pursuing in regard to the board,  said Rasmus Bessing, chief operating officer at PFA Asset Management.

An International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation has landed in Mozambique to follow up on a damning external audit into loans which were not cleared through parliament. The discovery of the loans prompted the IMF and Western donors to end budgetary support for Mozambique, leading to a collapse of its currency and defaults on its debt. Creditors including Russian bank VTB and Credit Suisse, which arranged the controversial $2 billion loans, are waiting for restructuring to start.  It is important that we restructure Mozambique's debt to VTB. I think that next year things will be different,  Mario Saraiva Ngwenya, Mozambique's ambassador to Russia, told Reuters.  There is now light at the end of the tunnel, we have started to get some money from some oil and gas contracts.  Mozambique has large natural gas reserves, in which international energy firms have bought stakes. Earlier this year Italy's Eni signed an $8 billion deal to develop a gas field off the coast of Mozambique. VTB said on Thursday it was open to dialogue with Mozambican officials with the aim of reaching a settlement that met conditions imposed by the IMF for debt sustainability.  We have proposed several different restructuring options to the Government of Mozambique. Currently the involved parties are waiting for the IMF debt sustainability assessment, this will allow for the restructuring talks to fully begin,  VTB said in a statement. The Mozambican ambassador to Moscow said there had been preliminary talks between officials from Mozambique's finance ministry and VTB Capital, the investment-banking arm of VTB, but that negotiations were yet to begin in earnest.

Relations between French media group Vivendi and Flavio Cattaneo have been strained since the Italian CEO had a heated exchange with Rome over the rollout of ultrafast broadband across Italy, sources told Reuters last week. This upset Vivendi, which is already under scrutiny for its growing influence in Italian business through its stake in TIM and a 30 percent share in private broadcaster Mediaset. Cattaneo denied on Tuesday any tensions with Telecom Italia's shareholders, its board or the group's chairman Arnaud de Puyfontaine, who is Vivendi's chief executive, and said he would remain until the end of his mandate in 2020. But a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that feuding between Vivendi and TIM was still going on and a second source said things might soon come to a head.  In one way or another, the French want to give a role to Genish,  said a source close to the matter. The Israeli businessman, who was appointed as Vivendi's Chief Convergence Officer in January, is a former head of Telefonica's Brazil unit and founder of Brazilian telecoms company GVT. A second source close to the matter said that Vivendi, which holds a 24 percent stake in Telecom Italia, has suggested appointing managers to work alongside Cattaneo, and that Genish was a top candidate for one of these roles. Genish was considered vital to Vivendi's successful foray in Brazil, where it bought GVT in 2010 and then sold it off to Telefonica four years later, making a more than $4 billion capital gain for Telefonica. The French company has since turned to him to integrate all of the content that Vivendi produces and delivers to clients. The source added that former Telecom Italia (TIM) Chairman and CEO Franco Bernabe has also been shortlisted, while Vivendi was also looking at the possibility of giving more power to TIM deputy chairman Giuseppe Recchi. It was not clear what position Genish would be asked to take in TIM nor whether Cattaneo would agree to the appointment.  Either (Cattaneo) agrees to work with these people or he will have to go,  the second source said, adding that the aim was to find a solution before the end of the month. A routine meeting of TIM's Nomination and Remuneration committee held on July 27 along with the group's board approving first half results, may examine the management changes, a third person with knowledge of the matter said. Cattaneo took over as chief executive at heavily-indebted TIM a little more than a year ago after his predecessor quit over strategy differences with Vivendi. The 54-year-old earned praise from Vivendi and other investors for cutting costs.

The deal, which was announced by the companies late on Thursday, values the two targets at roughly S$1.83 billion ($1.3 billion) in one of the biggest property takeover deals in the city state in recent years.  As a key global financial center, Singapore's real estate market continues to present a good value proposition for developers such as ourselves seeking to develop stable and recurring revenue streams,  Zhong Sheng Jian, Chairman and CEO of Yanlord said in a joint statement with Perennial. Yanlord, Perennial and other investors are buying out OCBC and its group companies' roughly one-third stake in United Engineers at S$2.6 per United Engineers' share, which will trigger a mandatory offer for the remaining shares. The consortium is also buying out OCBC and its group firms' 29.9 percent stakes in property firm WBL Corp, a closely-held subsidiary of United Engineers. United Engineers has property businesses, mainly in Singapore and China. Yanlord and Perennial also mainly own and manage sizeable portfolios in the same countries. Credit Suisse is advising OCBC and its group firms on the strategic review of their stakes in United Engineers. United Overseas Bank is the financial adviser to the consortium. An earlier attempt by OCBC and its group firms to sell their stakes in United Engineers had failed in 2014.

The new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 9) aim to make banks safer and avoid a repeat of the 2007-09 crisis by requiring them to put aside some money for loan losses much sooner than at present. But these rules may add to the woes of banks that have high levels of soured credit and are already struggling to raise capital, which forced Spain's Banco Popular POP.MC and two regional Italian banks out of business in recent weeks.     Two-thirds of banks surveyed by the European Banking Authority said they expected their provisions to go up by up to 18 percent as a result. The average respondent envisaged a 13 percent increase. The expected impact on provisions was lower than in the previous edition of the survey, which the EBA said may be due to progress made by banks in adapting to the new standards, better economic conditions and a change in the survey's question.  Banks have made further progress on the implementation of IFRS 9 since the previous exercise, but smaller banks are still lagging behind,  EBA said. It warned, in particular, that banks had scaled back plans to carry out parallel runs, where they apply the old and new accounting rules at the same time.   The lenders surveyed also expected the new standards to force them to recognize losses on existing loans that, while not defaulted, are at an increasing risk of not being repaid.  This would shave up to 75 basis points off their own funds, as measured by its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, for the vast majority of respondents and 45 basis points on average, the survey showed, with smaller banks faring worse. The new rules are due to kick in on Jan. 1, 2018 but heavy pushback by the banking lobby, particularly in Italy, meant European lawmakers were now considering a phase-in period over three years. Fitch Ratings said earlier this year it saw Irish, Spanish and Italian banks as the most vulnerable among those that use internal ratings for credit.

The market could see a rising trend if yields on fixed-income securities fall as expected by the central bank, said analysts.

New foreign investors have been buying Sri Lankan shares since the Pakistani bourse was upgraded as an emerging market from a frontier one, said analysts. Brokers said domestic investors have been waiting for clarity on the proposed inland revenue legislation, which some companies expect would result in higher costs of production. The IMF, which has long urged Sri Lanka to boost tax revenue through modernisation and simplification of its fiscal system, has urged the government to submit to parliament a new Inland Revenue Act.

Reuters has no independent confirmation the equipment on the dock was Siemens-made turbines. It comprised four cylindrical objects, several meters long, and covered with blue and gray tarpaulins. Their dimensions and shape match publicly-available photographs of Siemens gas turbine systems, which each consist of two major components: the turbine itself and a generator. Siemens said earlier this week that at least two of a total of four turbines it sold to Russian state firm Technopromexport had been delivered to Crimea against its wishes and without its knowledge. Russia seized the region from Ukraine in 2014 and it is now subject to European sanctions on energy technology. The German company filed a lawsuit against Technopromexport in Moscow on Tuesday requiring it to return the turbines to their original destination, Taman, Munich-based spokesman Wolfram Trost said. Taman, in southern Russia, is not subject to sanctions. On Wednesday, Yashar Azad, a spokesman for Siemens at its Bavarian headquarters, said the company was still trying to establish all the facts, including the location of the two other turbines, and had nothing to add to its previous statements. When asked about the situation, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters on Thursday that the gas turbines being installed in Crimea were of Russian origin.  Equipment related to the power sector is indeed being installed there (in Crimea). The equipment being installed there is of Russian origin,  said Peskov. Technopromexport, the Russian state company building the Crimean power plants, and Russia's energy ministry, declined to comment. Asked if the pieces of equipment at the port were Siemens turbines, a government official in Crimea told Reuters:  Come on, we can't talk about that. You understand: sanctions, Siemens.   Of course, this whole story is going to come out, but let it come out without us,  said this source, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. A still image taken from a video footage shows blue tarpaulins covering equipment at the port of Feodosia, Crimea July 9, 2017. Video footage taken July 9, 2017.Reuters TVIf the equipment that arrived in Feodosia is Siemens-made, it would show that Russia is pressing ahead with its plan, despite the Siemens lawsuit and a warning this week from the German government that the use of Siemens turbines in Crimea could harm future German investment in Russia. In the early hours of Thursday morning, two low-loader trucks carrying two of the pieces of equipment emerged from the port and set off in the direction of the Crimean city of Simferopol. Russia plans to install Siemens turbines at a power plant under construction in Simferopol, three sources close to the project told Reuters earlier this month. The slow-moving convoy was escorted by police vehicles, and police officers in body armor walked alongside the trucks on either side. Police and state security agents prevented a Reuters journalist from following the convoy. Slideshow (3 Images)The turbines affair has shone a harsh spotlight on how serious the European Union, its member states, and European companies are about enforcing the sanctions, imposed on Russia after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Siemens said on Monday it did everything possible to ensure compliance with sanctions.  Special Cargo Russia said in 2015 it needs four turbines in total for new power stations on the Crimean peninsula, which Ukraine cut from its electricity grid after it lost control. President Vladimir Putin promised the region's residents last year that he would ensure a stable power supply. Two of the turbines are for a power plant under construction in the city of Sevastopol, and the other two for a plant being built in Simferopol. On Tuesday, workers could be seen around the equipment at Feodosia port dressed in blue uniforms. Reuters reporters had observed the same uniforms on workers at Crimea's Simferopol and Sevastopol power stations, where, according to the three sources, Siemens-made turbines are to be installed. Siemens has said the two turbines it has confirmed had been transferred to Crimea had been among four sold to Technopromexport for use in a proposed power plant in Taman. Taman is on the Russian mainland 10 km (8 miles) east of Crimea across the Kerch Strait. A source close to the Crimea power plants project told Reuters last week, on condition of anonymity, that the plan was to deliver the second set of two turbines produced by Siemens to Feodosia port this month.

Yanlord, Perennial and other investors are buying out OCBC and its group companies' roughly one-third stake in United Engineers at S$2.6 per United Engineers' share, which will trigger a mandatory offer for the remaining shares. The consortium is also buying out OCBC and its group firms' 29.9 percent stakes in property firm WBL Corp, a closely-held subsidiary of United Engineers. United Engineers has property businesses, mainly in Singapore and China. Yanlord and Perennial also mainly own and manage sizeable portfolios in the same countries.

The full story – along with a selection of internal Philip Morris documents uncovered by Reuters – can be read online. (reut.rs/2sSSnyQ) Philip Morris International, which sells Marlboro and other cigarettes outside the United States, says there is nothing improper about its executives engaging with government officials.  As a company in a highly regulated industry, speaking with governments is part of our everyday business,  said Tony Snyder, vice president of communications for Philip Morris International.  The fact that Reuters has seen internal emails discussing our engagement with governments does not make those interactions inappropriate.  Philip Morris, which like other tobacco companies isn't invited to the biennial treaty meetings, runs covert operations centers in the cities hosting the treaty meetings. During these gatherings, the company's executives meet secretly with delegates from member nations that are party to the treaty. Some 90 percent of the world's nations are members of the FCTC. Since the treaty came into force in 2005, it has persuaded dozens of nations to boost taxes on tobacco products, pass laws banning smoking in public places and increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. Because of the treaty, an estimated 22 million smoking-related deaths will be averted, according to a study by researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center. For Philip Morris, the treaty is a  regulatory runaway train  driven by  anti-tobacco extremists,  according to a description contained in a 2014 internal PowerPoint presentation. While the company targets the biennial treaty conferences where new tobacco control measures are negotiated, it also intervenes at the country level where treaty delegates are picked and tobacco control laws are enacted. One of Philip Morris' goals has been to boost the presence of delegates in the national treaty delegations who are not from health agencies. That has happened, according to a Reuters analysis of delegation rosters. Delegations to the treaty now include more representatives of ministries linked to tax, finance or agriculture interests who may put revenues from tobacco over health concerns. The number of those delegates has risen from a few dozen in 2006 to more than 100 in recent years. The internal company documents detail efforts to stymie the anti-smoking treaty that span years and include dozens of employees. After the end of the FCTC conference in Moscow in 2014, Philip Morris executives congratulated themselves on weakening new anti-smoking proposals, including ones related to international trade, tobacco farming and tobacco company liability, internal emails show.

They were waiting for credentials to enter the World Health Organization's global tobacco treaty conference, one designed to curb smoking and combat the influence of the cigarette industry. Treaty officials didn't want them there. But still, among those lined up hoping to get in were executives from Japan Tobacco International and British American Tobacco Plc (BATS.L). There was a big name missing from the group: Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N). A Philip Morris representative later told Reuters its employees didn't turn up because the company knew it wasn't welcome. In fact, executives from the largest publicly traded tobacco firm had flown in from around the world to New Delhi for the anti-tobacco meeting. Unknown to treaty organizers, they were staying at a hotel an hour from the convention center, working from an operations room there. Philip Morris International would soon be holding secret meetings with delegates from the government of Vietnam and other treaty members. The object of these clandestine activities: the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking globally. Reuters has found that Philip Morris International is running a secretive campaign to block or weaken treaty provisions that save millions of lives by curbing tobacco use. In an internal document, the company says it supported the enactment of the treaty. But Philip Morris has come to view it as a  regulatory runaway train  driven by  anti-tobacco extremists  – a description contained in the document, a 2014 PowerPoint presentation. Confidential company documents and interviews with current and former Philip Morris employees reveal an offensive that stretches from the Americas to Africa to Asia, from hardscrabble tobacco fields to the halls of political power, in what may be one of the broadest corporate lobbying efforts in existence. Details of those plans are laid bare in a cache of Philip Morris documents reviewed by Reuters, one of the largest tobacco industry leaks ever. Reuters is publishing a selection of those papers in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) Dating from 2009 to 2016, the thousands of pages include emails between executives, PowerPoint presentations, planning papers, policy toolkits, national lobbying plans and market analyses. Taken as a whole, they present a company that has focused its vast global resources on bringing to heel the world's tobacco control treaty. Targeting the Treaty Philip Morris works to subvert the treaty on multiple levels. It targets the FCTC conferences where delegates gather to decide on anti-smoking guidelines. It also lobbies at the country level, where the makeup of FCTC delegations is determined and treaty decisions are turned into legislation. The documents, combined with reporting in 14 countries from Brazil to Uganda to Vietnam, reveal that a goal of Philip Morris is to increase the number of delegates at the treaty conventions who are not from health ministries or involved in public health. That's happening: A Reuters analysis of delegates to the FCTC's biennial conference shows a rise since the first convention in 2006 in the number of officials from ministries like trade, finance and agriculture for whom tobacco revenues can be a higher priority than health concerns. Philip Morris International says there is nothing improper about its executives engaging with government officials.  As a company in a highly regulated industry, speaking with governments is part of our everyday business,  Tony Snyder, vice president of communications, said in a statement in response to Reuters' findings.  The fact that Reuters has seen internal emails discussing our engagement with governments does not make those interactions inappropriate.  In a series of interviews in Europe and Asia, Philip Morris executive Andrew Cave said company employees are under strict instructions to obey both the company's own conduct policies and local law in the countries where they operate. Cave, a director of corporate affairs, said that while Philip Morris disagrees with some aspects of the FCTC treaty and consults with delegates offsite during its conferences, ultimately the delegations  make their own decisions.   We're respectful of the fact that this is their week and their event,  said Cave in an interview in New Delhi, as the parties to the treaty met last November. Asked in an earlier interview whether Philip Morris conducts a formal campaign targeting the treaty's biennial conferences, Cave gave a flat  no.  Health Impact When the FCTC delegates gather, lives hang in the balance. Decisions taken at the conferences over the past decade, including a ban on smoking in public places, are saving millions of lives, according to researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center. Between 2007 and 2014, more than 53 million people in 88 countries stopped smoking because those nations imposed stringent anti-smoking measures recommended by the WHO, according to their December 2016 study. Because of the treaty, an estimated 22 million smoking-related deaths will be averted, the researchers found. According to the WHO, though, tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death – and by 2030 will be responsible for eight million deaths a year, up from six million now. There was jubilation among anti-smoking advocates when the treaty was adopted in 2003. The treaty, which took effect in 2005, made it possible to push for measures that once seemed radical, such as smoke-free bars. About 90 percent of all nations eventually joined. A big holdout is the United States, which signed the treaty but has yet to ratify it. Since the FCTC came into force, it has persuaded dozens of nations to boost taxes on tobacco products, pass laws banning smoking in public places and increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. Treaty members gather every two years to consider new provisions or strengthen old ones at a meeting called the Conference of the Parties, or COP, which first convened in 2006 in Geneva. But an FCTC report shows that implementation of important sections of the treaty is stalling. There has been no further progress in the implementation of 7 out of 16  substantive  treaty articles since 2014, according to a report by the FCTC Secretariat in June last year. A key reason:  The tobacco industry continues to be the most important barrier in implementation of the Convention.  'More Powerful Than Ever' Indeed, the tobacco industry has weathered the tighter regulation. There has been only a slight 1.9 percent decline in global cigarette sales since the treaty took effect in 2005, and more people smoked daily in 2015 than a decade earlier, studies show. The Thomson Reuters Global Tobacco Index, which tracks tobacco stocks, has risen more than 100 percent in the past decade, largely due to price increases.  Some people think that with tobacco, you've won the battle,  said former Finnish Health Minister Pekka Puska, who chaired an FCTC committee last year.  No way,  he said.  The tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.  With 600 corporate affairs executives, according to a November 2015 internal email, Philip Morris has one of the world's biggest corporate lobbying arms. That army, and $7 billion-plus in annual net profit, gives Philip Morris the resources to overwhelm the FCTC. The treaty is overseen by 19 staff at a Secretariat office hosted by the WHO in Geneva. The Secretariat spends on average less than $6 million a year. Even when buttressed by anti-smoking groups, the Secretariat is outgunned. Its budget for this year and last year for supporting the treaty clause on combating tobacco company influence is less than $460,000. Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the FCTC treaty Secretariat, is the person tasked with preventing the industry from neutering the agreement. In two interviews at her Geneva office, da Costa e Silva, a medical doctor who holds a PhD in public health and has a dyed pink streak in her hair, explained why the FCTC banned attendance by any member of the public at the 2014 biennial conference in Moscow. The ban came in response to efforts by tobacco executives to use public badges to get inside the venue, she said, adding that industry representatives then started borrowing badges from delegates they knew to gain entry.  It's a real war,  said da Costa e Silva. But she had only a partial picture of the forces ranged against her. She wasn't aware of the fact that Philip Morris had a large team operating throughout the convention in Moscow, or the details of its activities in New Delhi last November.  This is so disgusting. These are the forces against which we have to work,  da Costa e Silva said in May after being told about the Philip Morris documents.  I think they want to implode the treaty.  Tobacco Outrage     The idea of a global tobacco treaty had been discussed among health advocates since at least 1979, when a WHO committee suggested the possibility. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway who became director-general of the WHO in 1998, made it happen. Related CoverageExclusive: Documents reveal Philip Morris' campaign to subvert the world's anti-smoking treatyShe was aided by outrage over documents that surfaced as part of the landmark 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, in which the four largest U.S. tobacco companies agreed to pay more than $200 billion to 46 U.S. states. The internal communications showed that tobacco executives lied for years about their knowledge of the deadly nature of cigarettes. A 1989 document revealed one company's plan to fight threats to the industry.  WHO's impact and influence is indisputable,  the document said. It went on to contemplate  countermeasures designed to contain/neutralize/re-orient the WHO.  That company was Philip Morris. In 2008, Altria Group Inc (MO.N) split up its Philip Morris business. Philip Morris USA, which remains a subsidiary of Altria, sells Marlboro and other brands in the United States. Philip Morris International was spun off, and handles business abroad. Since the split, Philip Morris International shares have more than doubled and Altria's have more than tripled. Philip Morris International's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, down the street from a patch of Gallo-Roman ruins, in a sleek building with a cafeteria, gym and a patio facing Lake Geneva. From there, the company is working to hobble the treaty. Internal company communications reveal the scope of Philip Morris' operation during the 2014 FCTC treaty meeting in Moscow. The company set up a  Coordinating Room  that could seat 42 people, according to the 2014 PowerPoint presentation, titled  Corporate affairs approach and issues.  Leading the operation was executive Chris Koddermann. Formerly a lawyer and lobbyist in Canada, Koddermann joined Philip Morris in 2010. He is now a director of regulatory affairs in Lausanne. The PowerPoint describes the ideal corporate affairs executive as someone who is able to  play the political game.  Koddermann previously worked for federal and provincial cabinet ministers in Canada, according to his LinkedIn profile. Reached on his cell phone in March, Koddermann said he wouldn't be able to meet and that any questions should be directed to Philip Morris International. Congratulatory Email At the end of the Moscow meeting, on Oct. 18, 2014, Koddermann sent an email congratulating a 33-person Philip Morris team on their success in diluting or blocking measures intended to strengthen tobacco controls and reduce cigarette sales. The gains he touted at the end of the week-long conference were the culmination of a two-year effort, his email said. The documents shed light on one key objective in Philip Morris' FCTC campaign: Keep tobacco within the ambit of international trade deals, so that the company has a way to mount legal campaigns against tobacco regulations. In Moscow, one proposal initially called for carving out tobacco from trade pacts. International trade treaties often include provisions, such as the protection of trademarks, that Philip Morris has used to challenge anti-smoking measures. If tobacco were taken out of the treaties, as suggested by the proposal, Philip Morris could be deprived of many such legal arguments. An early draft asked parties to support efforts to exclude tobacco from trade pacts and to prevent the industry from  abusing  trade and investment rules. In the end, the proposal was watered down. The final decision only reminded parties of  the possibility to take into account their public health objectives in their negotiation of trade and investment agreements.  There was no mention of excluding tobacco. Koddermann, in his email to colleagues on the last day of the conference, declared victory, describing the change as  a tremendous outcome.  Overall, the company achieved its  trade related campaign objectives,  including  avoiding a declaration of health over trade  and  avoiding the recognition of the FCTC as an international standard,  he wrote. The win was significant. A former Philip Morris employee said the company has routinely used trade treaties to challenge tobacco control laws. The aim, he said, was  to scare governments away from doing regulatory changes.  Even though the tobacco industry has lost a series of major legal battles, its suits have served to discourage the implementation of regulations that curb smoking. Those delays can yield years of unimpeded sales. As the Philip Morris PowerPoint presentation from 2014 put it:  Roadblocks are as important as solutions.  'Watered Down' One roadblock was a campaign to stop the 2011 introduction of rules in Australia banning logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The company's litigation and arbitration against the measure ultimately were dismissed – but not before five countries filed complaints against Australia on the same subject at the World Trade Organization. The global trade body has yet to announce a decision in the matter.

To match Special Report PMI-WHO/FCTCKen Cedeno/File PhotoThe attempt to undo Australia's regulations has had a chilling effect elsewhere. It slowed the introduction of plain-packaging rules in New Zealand. Citing the risk that tobacco companies may  mount legal challenges,  the government announced in 2013 that it was postponing the move and waiting to  see what happens with Australia's legal cases.  The legislation is now scheduled to go into effect next year. In his Moscow conference email, Koddermann also expressed pleasure at the fate of a proposal on farmers. Initial language would have recommended that countries restrict support for tobacco growers. The proposal was  significantly watered down,  he wrote.  This is a very positive result.  Gustavo Bosio, at the time a manager for international trade, chimed in a few days after the conference in an email:  These excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow.  Philip Morris isn't alone in seeking to weaken the treaty. Ahead of the 2012 FCTC conference, in Seoul, four cigarette giants – Philip Morris, British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Brands Plc (IMB.L) – formed an  informal industry Working Group  to oppose various proposals on tobacco taxation, according to an internal BAT document reviewed by Reuters. The 45-page paper, whose existence hasn't been previously reported, noted that the group would coordinate  to the extent that these issues do not raise any anti-competitive concerns.  The paper outlined a global campaign planned by BAT to counter the FCTC, which was  increasingly going beyond  its mandate. And it listed objectives, including a bid to block discussions around the introduction of a minimum 70 percent tax on tobacco. BAT declined to answer questions about the industry working group. Both Imperial and Japan Tobacco International said they didn't want to comment on a document from a competitor. Japan Tobacco International said its tax experts met with counterparts from other tobacco companies to discuss treaty guidelines on taxation ahead of the 2012 conference. Philip Morris did not comment on the document. Wooing Delegates The Philip Morris emails and documents don't explicitly detail how the company pulled off the victories in Moscow. But they provide insight into the importance it places on wooing delegates. The FCTC traditionally makes decisions by consensus, and so influencing a single national delegation can have an outsized impact. The treaty has a key clause meant to keep the industry from unduly influencing delegations. Article 5.3, as it's known, says nations should protect their public health policies from tobacco interests. Guidelines that accompany Article 5.3 recommend that countries interact with the industry only when  strictly necessary.  But the article – a single sentence – contains a loophole Philip Morris has exploited. The sentence ends with the words  in accordance with national law,  opening the door to arguments by pro-tobacco forces that any lobbying that's legal in a certain country is permissible when interacting with that country's representatives. They also argue that a sentence in a related document, the guidelines for Article 5.3, allows for such interactions to take place as long as they are conducted transparently. One of the company's targets has been Vietnam. The day the Moscow meeting ended, Koddermann received an email from his colleague Nguyen Thanh Ky, a leading corporate affairs executive for Vietnam. Ky said he had a  debrief lunch  with the Vietnamese delegation and had a good outcome to report: The delegation was in favor of  moderate and reasonable measures  to be implemented over a  practical timeline,  he wrote. He did not specify which measures they discussed. The Vietnamese delegation spoke up often during the Moscow meeting. A review of notes compiled by tobacco-control groups accredited as observers showed Vietnam's interjections frequently mirrored Philip Morris' positions on tobacco-control regulations. Just like the tobacco giant, the Vietnamese said a higher tax on cigarettes would lead to more illicit sales. Like Philip Morris, they said the FCTC should stay out of trade disputes. And like Philip Morris, they opposed proposals to set uniform parameters for the legal liability of tobacco companies. The FCTC guidelines on taxation did ultimately include a WHO recommendation for a minimum tax of 70 percent – something Philip Morris opposed. But the proposal to give the treaty more sway over trade disputes was weakened, and measures to strengthen the legal liability of cigarette companies were delayed. Vietnam's foreign ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters. Secret Rendezvous As soon as the conference ended, the documents show, Philip Morris turned to the next one: the 2016 meeting in India. Slideshow (17 Images)The 2014 PowerPoint presentation outlined the need to identify ways to gather intelligence during the Delhi conference. In a separate 2015 planning document, the company talks about the arrangement of farmer protests in the run-up to the meeting. Such protests did take place – including one in front of WHO offices in New Delhi. Reuters couldn't determine whether Philip Morris was behind those demonstrations. While other major tobacco companies also sent people to Delhi in November, Philip Morris was distinguished by its stealth. Executives from the company did not sign in with their tobacco industry colleagues at the FCTC convention center and stayed at a hotel about an hour's drive away. The anonymity and distance helped Philip Morris approach delegates covertly. On the second day of the conference, a white Toyota van pulled away from the front of the Hyatt Regency hotel – where Philip Morris had its operations room – and headed for the FCTC treaty venue. The van was carrying Ky, its corporate affairs executive from Vietnam. Ky's driver talked his way past police at the barricade outside the conference center, where FCTC-issued credentials were checked, explaining that he was driving  VIPs,  the driver later told Reuters. A few minutes later, a man in a dark suit walked out of the conference center, passed the van and stopped at a street corner. The van did a U-turn, and a Reuters reporter saw the man in the suit quickly climb in. He was a senior member of Vietnam's delegation to the FCTC conference: Nguyen Vinh Quoc, a Vietnamese government official. The driver, Kishore Kumar, said in an interview that he dropped the two men off at a local hotel. Kumar said that on several other occasions that week, he took Ky to pick up people from the Hotel Formule1, a budget lodging where Vietnam's delegation was staying during the conference. Ky and Quoc did not respond to requests for comment. Asked by Reuters about the interaction between Ky and the Vietnam representatives, Philip Morris executive Andrew Cave thumped on the table in a bar at the hotel where company representatives were staying. Reuters should focus, he said, on efforts by the industry to develop so-called reduced-risk products – those that deliver nicotine without the burning of tobacco and which the company says reduce harm. When pressed about the meetings with Vietnam, Cave thumped the table again:  I'm angry that you're focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.  In a subsequent email, Cave said:  Representatives from Philip Morris International met with delegates from Vietnam  during the Delhi conference  to discuss policy issues and this complied fully with PMI's internal procedures and the laws and regulations of Vietnam.  Delegates, Cave said in separate interviews, are reluctant to meet openly with Philip Morris because they are afraid of being  named and shamed  by anti-smoking groups. 'Slavery Ended a Long Time Ago' Some delegates questioned the extent to which Philip Morris shaped the decisions made at the Moscow conference, saying attendees genuinely disagreed on certain issues. Nuntavarn Vichit-Vadakan, a Thai delegate, oversaw many discussions as the chair of an FCTC committee at the Moscow conference. She said delegates differed over the regulation of e-cigarettes, for instance, and any lobbying the company carried out would not have determined the outcome. The Philip Morris documents leave questions unanswered. In some cases, the documents show the company hatching plans to change an anti-smoking regulation or to monitor activists, but don't always make clear to what extent or how the plans were executed, if at all. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation called for  achieving scrutiny  of tobacco control advocates and said a  global project team  had been established for this purpose. It did not list what means would be used. In some instances, Philip Morris' lobbying plainly failed. In July 2015, the Ugandan parliament passed sweeping new anti-tobacco laws inspired by the treaty. All that was needed was President Yoweri Museveni's signature, and the small African nation would become a leader on the continent in implementing a strict interpretation of the FCTC. Philip Morris sent an executive, a younger white man, to tell the septuagenarian president, who long ago had helped topple dictator Idi Amin, why the tobacco act was a bad idea. Sheila Ndyanabangi, Uganda's lead health official for tobacco issues who was present at the meeting, described the executive's approach as lecturing the statesman.  He said, 'Ugandan tobacco will be too expensive' and 'it will not be competitive,'  Ndyanabangi said. Her account was confirmed by a senior Ugandan government official who was also present. Museveni stared for a moment at the Philip Morris executive and a representative from a major tobacco buyer who'd come with him. The president then declared:  Slavery ended a long time ago.  There was a long silence in the room, recalled Ndyanabangi. Museveni said Uganda didn't need tobacco, and the meeting was over. The president signed the bill that September. Museveni's office did not respond to requests for comment. Changing the Delegations Over time, however, the industry's lobbying has slowed the treaty's progress. At the biennial conferences, the discussions have changed. In Moscow, for instance, there was a strong focus on trade and taxes.  You could see from the floor that interventions were very, very, very much focusing on the trade aspects, many times even putting trade over health,  the FCTC's da Costa e Silva said in an interview last year. The composition of FCTC delegations sent by governments has changed to include more members who aren't involved in health policy. That's in line with what Philip Morris and other tobacco companies want: Philip Morris, as well as British American Tobacco, has sought to move the balance of the membership away from public health officials and toward ministries like finance and trade. Such agencies, said the former Philip Morris executive, benefit from tobacco tax revenues and attach less weight to health concerns.  The health department would just want tobacco to be banned, while for the finance ministry it's more like how can we leverage or get as much money as we can,  he said. The object of Philip Morris' efforts, according to the 2014 PowerPoint on corporate affairs, is to  move tobacco issues away  from health ministries and demonstrate there are broader public interests at play – that  it's not about tobacco.  Cave, the Philip Morris corporate affairs executive, confirmed the company tries to persuade governments to change the composition of delegations. Health officials, he said, aren't equipped to handle the intricacies of issues such as taxation.  You're looking at illicit trade, you're looking at tax regimes, you're looking at international law,  he said.  Now each of these areas, it's logical, if you want to really tackle the trade and tobacco smuggling, illicit trade, who would you go to? You wouldn't go to the health ministry.  Reuters analyzed the rosters of the almost 3,500 accredited delegation members who have attended the seven FCTC conferences since 2006. The analysis found that there were more than six health delegates for every finance-related delegate in 2006. In Delhi last year, that ratio had fallen to just over three health delegates for every finance delegate. The number of delegates from finance, agriculture and trade fields has risen from a few dozen in 2006 to more than 100 in recent years. Vietnam's delegation, for example, has changed markedly. At the first FCTC conference in 2006, none of its four delegates were from finance or trade ministries. By 2014, in Moscow, there were 13 delegates, with at least four from finance-related ministries, including the chief delegate. Vietnam's foreign ministry did not respond to questions about the delegation. Da Costa e Silva isn't opposed to having delegates from trade ministries, but she says their primary focus needs to be on health. And she was concerned by the makeup of the Vietnamese delegation. In a letter to the Vietnamese prime minister in late 2015, she asked that tobacco industry employees be excluded from the delegation. If they weren't, she wrote, Vietnam might be  unable to play a full part in discussions.  In 2016, Vietnam brought 11 delegates to the conference, of whom six were from health agencies, including the chief representative. Some tobacco-control activists who attended the Delhi meeting in November say it was the worst so far in terms of passing new anti-smoking provisions. Matthew Myers, who heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said multiple countries came prepared to consciously block action. He said he heard delegates making arguments  I haven’t heard in 25 years.  A Nigerian delegate, for instance, asked to remove a reference to  the tobacco epidemic  from a draft proposal on liability for tobacco-related harm, according to notes taken by anti-smoking groups. Asked for comment, Christiana Ukoli, head of the delegation in Delhi, said the  Nigerian delegation strongly dissociates itself from [that] statement.  The Delhi conference ended as it began, with treaty Secretariat officials not knowing where Philip Morris had been or what it had done. The company had flown in a team of executives, used a squad of identical vans to ferry officials in New Delhi, and then left town without a trace.

Talk that more capacity cuts were on the way in China fed into broader-based concerns over slowing output to push prices higher, analysts said. An industry association said last month that China will launch a crackdown to curb illegal expansion of aluminium capacity.  This is all about the looming cutback to Chinese supply growth, due to both the current investigation into illegal capacity, and in the medium to longer term the expected slowdown in Chinese capacity growth,  Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said.

The new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 9) aim to make banks safer and avoid a repeat of the 2007-09 crisis by requiring them to put aside some money for loan losses much sooner than at present. But these rules may add to the woes of banks that have high levels of soured credit and are already struggling to raise capital, which forced Spain's Banco Popular POP.MC and two regional Italian banks out of business in recent weeks.     Two-thirds of banks surveyed by the European Banking Authority said they expected their provisions to go up by up to 18 percent as a result. The average respondent envisaged a 13 percent increase. The expected impact on provisions was lower than in the previous edition of the survey, which the EBA said may be due to progress made by banks in adapting to the new standards, better economic conditions and a change in the survey's question.  Banks have made further progress on the implementation of IFRS 9 since the previous exercise, but smaller banks are still lagging behind,  EBA said. It warned, in particular, that banks had scaled back plans to carry out parallel runs, where they apply the old and new accounting rules at the same time.   The lenders surveyed also expected the new standards to force them to recognize losses on existing loans that, while not defaulted, are at an increasing risk of not being repaid.  This would shave up to 75 basis points off their own funds, as measured by its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, for the vast majority of respondents and 45 basis points on average, the survey showed, with smaller banks faring worse. The new rules are due to kick in on Jan. 1, 2018 but heavy pushback by the banking lobby, particularly in Italy, meant European lawmakers were now considering a phase-in period over three years. Fitch Ratings said earlier this year it saw Irish, Spanish and Italian banks as the most vulnerable among those that use internal ratings for credit.

The views expressed are his own) Saudi Arabia is trying to support oil prices by reducing its crude shipments to the United States in a bid to cut the amount of oil in commercial storage. U.S. crude imports from Saudi Arabia averaged less than 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the four weeks ending on July 7, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia are running at the slowest rate since 2015, and the slowest for the time of year for over five years (tmsnrt.rs/2tM4mAO and tmsnrt.rs/2thOpza). Imports from Saudi Arabia will fall even further to less than 800,000 bpd in August, according to a Saudi industry source familiar with the kingdom's oil policy.  Saudi Arabia is keen to see an improvement in the oil market and accelerate the balancing process,  the source told Reuters on Wednesday ( Saudis to cut August oil exports to lowest level this year , Reuters, July 12). Saudi Arabia is cutting exports to all destinations but reducing shipments to the United States is especially important because U.S. stocks are the most visible and have the biggest impact on prices. The United States accounts for more than 40 percent of the commercial crude and product stocks held in the OECD and its stocks are reported weekly rather than monthly as in most other countries. U.S. crude and product stocks therefore receive disproportionate attention from oil traders and analysts, and can have a major impact on global oil prices. Changes in U.S. crude and products stocks are often (misleadingly) interpreted to reflect changes in the global supply-demand balance. Saudi Arabia is the largest supplier of crude oil to the United States after Canada, providing an average of 1.1 million bpd to U.S. refiners in 2016. By restricting shipments, Saudi Arabia hopes to reduce U.S. stocks and demonstrate to skeptical traders that the long-awaited rebalancing of the global market is finally underway. The strategy seems to have had some early success with U.S. crude stocks falling earlier and faster than normal so far in the second and third quarters of 2017. U.S. crude stocks have fallen by 40 million barrels since the end of March, compared with a drawdown of just 8 million barrels over the same period in 2016. U.S. crude stocks are now just 3 million barrels higher than at the same point in 2016, compared with 35 million barrels higher at the end of March. Most of the drawdown in crude stocks is attributable to record refinery runs but slower imports likely played an important supporting role. Senior officials from Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC are hoping U.S. stocks will continue to decline rapidly through the rest of the summer driving season. Saudi Arabia plans to use big stock draws to convince the oil market that rebalancing is happening and oil prices and calendar spreads need to rise. The strategy has a fair chance of success but it could be threatened by rising U.S. imports from other OPEC and non-OPEC members or a diversion of Saudi shipments from the United States to other markets. While Saudi Arabia's crude shipments to the United States have fallen, Iraq's shipments have risen to their highest seasonal level in almost five years (tmsnrt.rs/2thBJYM). The International Energy Agency reports compliance with OPEC's production agreement declined sharply in June to its lowest level in six months ( Oil Market Report , IEA, July 2017). OPEC output rose from Nigeria and Libya, which are not capped by the agreement, and as a result of weakening compliance among other members. Some of this extra crude could end up refilling U.S. storage tanks, which would undercut Saudi efforts to drain them. Oil traders will also be alert for any signs crude shipments are being diverted causing stocks to grow in other less visible locations. Beyond August, there are questions about what happens to shipments and stocks when the U.S. driving season finishes and Saudi Arabia and Iraq start burning less crude as the summer air-conditioning season winds down. For now, though, OPEC hopes traders will interpret a sustained draw in U.S. crude stocks as a sign the market is rebalancing and that prices need to move higher.

The Office for Budget Responsibility said ensuring robust trade agreements was more significant for the long-run health of Britain's public finances than the size of any  divorce bill  to settle one-off liabilities with the EU.  While some numbers mooted for it are very large, a one-off hit of this sort would not pose a big threat to fiscal sustainability. More important are the implications of whatever agreements are reached with the EU ... for the long-term growth of the UK economy,  the OBR said. Just a 0.1 percentage-point fall in the annual growth rate of the economy and tax revenues would cause Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio to be 50 percentage points higher after 50 years, if public spending plans remained unchanged, the public body added. A continuation of Britain's recent weak productivity would also make tax rises or spending cuts more likely, the OBR said. Finance minister Philip Hammond said the report was  a stark reminder of why we must deliver on our commitment to deal with our country's debts . British public debt stands at 1.6 trillion pounds ($2.1 trillion) or 80 percent of GDP, more than twice its level before the financial crisis, though below some other major economies such as the United States, Japan and France. Debt Risk  The budget deficit fell to a 10-year low of 2.4 percent of GDP last year - leaving debt as a share of GDP on track to fall by a small amount each year.  Hammond wants to run a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade so that the debt burden will fall faster, but Prime Minister Theresa May's minority government is under pressure to loosen the purse-strings after years of austerity. The OBR said that debt tended only to fall slowly as a share of GDP, but typically rose sharply during times of war or economic crisis. Britain's higher debt level than before the financial crisis meant it was more vulnerable to rises in interest rates or inflation than in the past, the OBR said. Other big risks to the public finances in the medium term included rising healthcare and pension costs as the population ages, and, to a lesser extent, lower immigration.  Under a scenario of a sharp recession combined with much higher interest rates that is similar to one which the Bank of England tested British banks against last year, British public sector debt could rise to 114 percent of GDP, the OBR said. The OBR did not quantify the risk of a major war, climate change or a cyber-attack.

Two days of proceedings at the Council of State is considering appeals against a government plan to curb production at the massive field by an additional 10 percent from Oct. 1. Residents want extraction at the field, which once supplied 10 percent of the European Union's gas needs, to be stopped altogether due to minor earthquakes that have damaged thousands of homes and buildings. NAM has accepted civil responsibility for damage caused by the quakes and is paying damages of more than 1 billion euros. Gas production company NAM, a joint venture between oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobile, said it has appealed against the proposed cut because the decision ignored earlier agreed safety norms. Opponents accused NAM and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which sets production levels, of underestimating the dangers of the gas extraction.  We have consistently been lied to,  lawyer Nette Kruzenga, representing a group of Groningen residents, told the court.  The NAM is only interested in maximizing production, and the government is ignoring its task to protect people.  The Dutch government has lowered production at Groningen several times over the past three years due to small earthquakes triggered by gas extraction. The latest cap, announced in May, would lower output to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, down from 53.9 bcm in 2013. The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture has said it had been put in an impossible position having been told it could continue production, vital to supply millions of Dutch homes with gas for heating and cooking, but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards.

The Office for Budget Responsibility said ensuring robust trade agreements was more significant for the long-run health of Britain's public finances than the size of any  divorce bill  to settle one-off liabilities with the EU.  While some numbers mooted for it are very large, a one-off hit of this sort would not pose a big threat to fiscal sustainability. More important are the implications of whatever agreements are reached with the EU ... for the long-term growth of the UK economy,  the OBR said. Just a 0.1 percentage-point fall in the annual growth rate of the economy and tax revenues would cause Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio to be 50 percentage points higher after 50 years, if public spending plans remained unchanged, the public body added. A continuation of Britain's recent weak productivity would also make tax rises or spending cuts more likely, the OBR said. Finance minister Philip Hammond said the report was  a stark reminder of why we must deliver on our commitment to deal with our country's debts . British public debt stands at 1.6 trillion pounds ($2.1 trillion) or 80 percent of GDP, more than twice its level before the financial crisis, though below some other major economies such as the United States, Japan and France. Debt Risk  The budget deficit fell to a 10-year low of 2.4 percent of GDP last year - leaving debt as a share of GDP on track to fall by a small amount each year.  Hammond wants to run a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade so that the debt burden will fall faster, but Prime Minister Theresa May's minority government is under pressure to loosen the purse-strings after years of austerity. The OBR said that debt tended only to fall slowly as a share of GDP, but typically rose sharply during times of war or economic crisis. Britain's higher debt level than before the financial crisis meant it was more vulnerable to rises in interest rates or inflation than in the past, the OBR said. Other big risks to the public finances in the medium term included rising healthcare and pension costs as the population ages, and, to a lesser extent, lower immigration.  Under a scenario of a sharp recession combined with much higher interest rates that is similar to one which the Bank of England tested British banks against last year, British public sector debt could rise to 114 percent of GDP, the OBR said. The OBR did not quantify the risk of a major war, climate change or a cyber-attack.

In May, Prosecutor-General Rodigo Janot reached a plea deal with both siblings, in which they agreed to turn in 1,893 politicians they bribed.

European Commission deputy head Frans Timmermans called for the Hungarian government to respond within a month to Brussels' criticism that the Higher Education Law could shut down a Budapest university founded by U.S. financier George Soros.  The EU executive has long been exasperated by what it sees as Prime Minister Viktor Orban's authoritarian tendencies.    We expect a reaction from the Hungarian authorities within a month,  Timmermans said in a statement.  If the response is not satisfactory, the Commission can decide to go to the Court.  In a  reasoned opinion  issued on Thursday, the second step in legal action against a member state for breaching EU rules, the Commission said the law  runs counter to the right of academic freedom, the right to education and the freedom to conduct a business . The Commission also sent a letter to Hungary saying a new law governing foreign-funded non-government organizations did not comply with EU legislation, the first step toward legal action by the 28-country EU. While Brussels can open cases against EU states violating common rules, they are lengthy and often have little impact. That means the EU executive has limited leverage over Orban, who has been in office since 2010. Orban has often bashed the EU and repeatedly clashed with non-governmental organizations sponsored by Soros, who promotes a liberal and internationalist world view that the nationalist-minded Hungarian leader dislikes.  A recent anti-migrant billboard campaign by Orban's government that features an image of Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew, has been criticized by Jewish groups and others for fomenting anti-Semitism. The threat of legal action comes after months of dialogue between the Commission and Hungary over grievances that go beyond the higher education law.  Orban's  illiberal  brand of democracy has already earned him a tongue-in-cheek greeting of  Hello Dictator!  from the head of the executive, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

The affirmation reflects the continued sound liquidity of the revenue bond programme and our expectation that it will remain sufficient and well-protected until maturity. We also expect the programme to continue to be ring-fenced from MPK's other operations. The city and its bond programme are credit-linked to its sole owner the City of Lodz, according to our Rating of Public-Sector Entities criteria. KEY RATING DRIVERS The City of Lodz regularly pays MPK remuneration for the Lodzki Tramwaj Regionalny (LTR) tram transport service, the construction of which was financed by the revenue bond programme to the amount of PLN166 million. At end-May 2017 (last settlement date), the outstanding amount under the bonds was PLN86.8 million and accounted for 35% of MPK's debt. The LTR investment is of high importance for the city, which approved its financing through revenue bonds. We therefore assume that the company as well as the LTR investment and its financing are credit-linked to the city. The assumption is based on the assessment of the following credit factors for the revenue bond programme: Legal Status: Midrange The bondholders enjoy special legal protection. They have first claim on revenue from the LTR transport service, on the equity injections made by the city and also have a pledge on LTR assets that excludes them from the bankruptcy estate. During the programme's lifetime, the City of Lodz is obliged to contract with MPK for the LTR transport service and inject equity into MPK, to help service the revenue bonds over the long term. Strategic importance: Strong MPK is the city's internal public transport operator in the Lodz area and is of strategic importance to the City of Lodz as it fulfils the city's transport responsibilities. The city is committed to ensuring the company's financial viability, including the liquidity of the revenue bond programme. We assume that the city is willing and has the capacity to provide additional financial support if necessary. Control: Strong The City of Lodz has strict control over management, operations, investments and financing of the company. This includes tight control of MPK's cash flows under the revenue bond programme. Integration: Strong The City Lodz's payments under the tram and bus contract, LTR contract and support agreement are included in the city's multi-year financial plan and scheduled until 2032. Revenue from the public sector accounted for 61% of MPK's total in 2016 and historically, the City of Lodz's payments for public transport service accounted for about 12%-15% of the city's operating expenditure. Additional rating factors for the revenue bond programme are: Remuneration for the LTR transport service is stable, at around PLN24 million annually (4% of MPK's revenue). The remuneration and equity injections are paid into the venture account (VA) to ring-fence LTR revenue from MPK's other operating risks. MPK can only access the VA for purposes other than relating to the bond programme if the amount within the account exceeds 12 months of bond service. We project that remuneration for the LTR transport service and the equity injections will exceed the annual bond obligations until 2021 by at least 1.8x, limiting the risk for bondholders. We assume satisfactory liquidity for the revenue bond programme will prevail until maturity in 2030. In the last settlement period (June 2016-May 2017), payments made by the city totalled PLN26.9 million and exceeded the annual bond obligations (PLN9.4 million) by about 3x. RATING SENSITIVITIES The revenue bonds' rating may be downgraded if special protection of the bondholders weakens or if the liquidity of the VA deteriorates significantly. Any weakening in the strategic importance of MPK to the City of Lodz leading to reduced willingness to support the company may cause a rating downgrade. A downgrade could also stem from weaker fiscal performance or increased indebtedness of the City of Lodz, leading to deterioration in the sponsor's internally assessed creditworthiness. A full guarantee from the City of Lodz covering all of MPK's obligations under the revenue bond programme or a strengthening of the city's credit profile could lead to a rating upgrade.

The impact of the first day of Yellen's Congressional testimony, which markets took as a signal the U.S. central bank may go softer with monetary policy tightening than it has previously insisted, was fading on the U.S. dollar in morning trade in Europe. A pair of reports on the European Central Bank's expected wind-down of quantitative easing buffetted the single currency in midday trade in Europe. But the dominant factor was further gains for share prices across Europe and Asia, driving bids for the currencies most closely-connected to appetite for risk on financial markets and pushing the kiwi to a five-month high.  The focus is shifting to these more risky trades,  said John Hardy, head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank in London.  Yellen proved more dovish on the margin than expected. That gave the green light to carry trades... and emerging markets and commodities have performed strongly. That may be the focus for the next 10 days, maybe longer.  Against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength, the U.S. dollar fell back to its lowest since last October in Asian trading, undoing all of a recovery last week driven by generally higher global bond yields. But it steadied in the European morning, trading flat against the basket at 95.754 and 0.1 percent higher against the euro at $1.1402. The kiwi and Aussie dollars rode out a poor set of New Zealand data to stand respectively 1.5 percent and 0.8 percent higher on the day, leading gains for the G10 group of developed world currencies along with the Swedish crown. Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 FX strategy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London, said that while the dollar looked broadly weaker, there was substantial resistance to any gains past $1.15 for the euro. A number of major banks say investors have also not bought heavily into the yen's gains against the dollar over the past fortnight, making it riskier for them to jump on the rally now.  Dollar/yen has been appreciating but investors do not have the trade,  he said.  Overall positioning on emerging markets is still long. On G10 it is very light. People are going to try and pick the central banks which will be going faster on rate rises in the future.  The U.S. currency has been falling steadily since hitting a 14-year high at the start of this year and a number of major banks who had previously backed it to gain further have called its longer-term rally as over. But against that is the continuing contrast in interest rates - and the outlook for them - in the United States and Europe and Japan. U.S. 10-year interest rates are 4 times - or almost 2 full percentage points - higher than those in Germany.  Our data suggests that U.S. inflation is actually picking up again,  said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.  The Fed appears to still be in a position to continue hiking rates.

European Commission deputy head Frans Timmermans called for the Hungarian government to respond within a month to Brussels' criticism that the Higher Education Law could shut down a Budapest university founded by U.S. financier George Soros.  The EU executive has long been exasperated by what it sees as Prime Minister Viktor Orban's authoritarian tendencies.    We expect a reaction from the Hungarian authorities within a month,  Timmermans said in a statement.  If the response is not satisfactory, the Commission can decide to go to the Court.  In a  reasoned opinion  issued on Thursday, the second step in legal action against a member state for breaching EU rules, the Commission said the law  runs counter to the right of academic freedom, the right to education and the freedom to conduct a business . The Commission also sent a letter to Hungary saying a new law governing foreign-funded non-government organizations did not comply with EU legislation, the first step toward legal action by the 28-country EU. While Brussels can open cases against EU states violating common rules, they are lengthy and often have little impact. That means the EU executive has limited leverage over Orban, who has been in office since 2010. Orban has often bashed the EU and repeatedly clashed with non-governmental organizations sponsored by Soros, who promotes a liberal and internationalist world view that the nationalist-minded Hungarian leader dislikes.  A recent anti-migrant billboard campaign by Orban's government that features an image of Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew, has been criticized by Jewish groups and others for fomenting anti-Semitism. The threat of legal action comes after months of dialogue between the Commission and Hungary over grievances that go beyond the higher education law.  Orban's  illiberal  brand of democracy has already earned him a tongue-in-cheek greeting of  Hello Dictator!  from the head of the executive, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

Eight decades after one of Russia's darkest chapters, it is his reputation, not Stalin's, that is on trial.    The historian, 61, is being tried on charges brought by state prosecutors of involving his 11-year-old adopted daughter in child pornography, illegally possessing  the main elements of  a firearm, and of depravity involving a minor.  If convicted of the charges, which he denies, he faces up to 15 years in jail. Fellow historians, rights activists and some of Russia's leading cultural figures say Dmitriev has been framed because his focus on Stalin's crimes has become politically untenable under President Vladimir Putin.  They say his real crime is dedicating himself to documenting Stalin's 1937-38 Great Terror, in which nearly 700,000 people were executed, according to conservative official estimates. His arrest followed close on the heels of the release by Memorial, the organization for which he works, of a list of more than 40,000 Stalin-era secret policemen, a move that raised an outcry among some of their descendants.   With a national election due in March that Putin is expected to contest and win, anything that jars with a Kremlin narrative that Russia must not be ashamed of its past is unwelcome. Reuters was unable to independently determine if the case against Dmitriev was related to his work. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the government did not play any role.  It's not like that,  Peskov told Reuters.  The Kremlin is not involved in such cases.    Historians, relatives and rights activists are not convinced. Show trials were common in Stalin's era. History, they say, is repeating itself.  It's unfortunately not a one-off case,  said prominent historian Nikolai Svanidze, who sits on an official body that relays human rights concerns to Putin.  The authorities are taking a hard look at historians. They regard history, or our past, as an ideological selection process. Honest historians are seen as political opponents.  Blogger Vladimir Luzgin found that out last year after reposting an article on social media which said Stalin's Soviet Union had conspired with Nazi Germany to invade Poland in 1939. A court found him guilty of knowingly distributing false information and fined him 200,000 roubles ($3,368.43).  Luzgin could not be reached for comment.  The Case The case against Dmitriev centers on whether or not naked photos he took of his daughter from 2008 to 2015 are pornographic, as state investigators allege. The girl was adopted at age three after a drawn-out court battle with social services because Dmitriev, an adoptee himself, was deemed to be too old. He and his second wife separated soon afterwards. Dmitriev's lawyer, Viktor Anufriev, said his client, who is used to meticulously photographing evidence in his professional life, took the pictures twice a year to document her physical condition in case of further problems with social services. He became particularly worried after carers at the girl's nursery school expressed concern about marks on her skin that turned out to be residue from a medical dressing, Anufriev told Reuters.     The daughter has not made a complaint, he said. Dmitriev could not be reached for comment in jail in north-west Russia, where he has sat since his arrest in December. Anufriev expects a verdict in the case, which started on June 1, on Sept. 1. One of Dmitriev's two children from his first marriage, Yekaterina Klodt, told a Moscow news conference in June the allegations were  absurd  and likened the trial to a circus.   FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a placard reading,  Freedom for Yuri Dmitriev  during a protest in support of political prisoners in central St. Petersburg, Russia, February 6, 2017. Interpress/Roman Pimenov viaFile PhotoShe and her children spent a great deal of time with Dmitriev and his adopted daughter and considered themselves  one family,  Klodt said. Dmitriev was a wonderful father to her as well as to his adopted daughter, who was now distraught to have been separated from him, she said. She linked his prosecution to his work, including the discovery of the mass graves.  Not everyone liked what he did,  she said. The Investigative Committee of Karelia, whose investigators submitted the case for prosecution, did not respond to Reuters' questions about whether there was a political side to the trial, saying only that there was enough evidence to open a criminal case. The committee declined to elaborate on its evidence. Mass Grave at Sandarmokh Putin has called Stalin  a complex figure .   Excessive demonisation of Stalin is one of the ways to attack the Soviet Union and Russia, to show that today's Russia bears some kind of birthmark from Stalinism,  he told U.S. filmmaker Oliver Stone in June.  He also noted that  the horrors  of Stalin's rule should not be forgotten. But some historians fret that the annexation of Crimea, which Kremlin-backed TV cast as a righteous replay of World War Two, has emboldened Stalin's admirers. Monuments and memorial plaques to Stalin are springing up in different Russian regions. State-approved textbooks have softened his image, and an opinion poll in June crowned him the country's most outstanding historical figure.     As head of the local branch of Memorial, which documents Russia's Soviet past, Dmitriev was part of a team that found a mass grave at Sandarmokh in the north-west in 1997.  More than 9,000 people, many of them members of the Soviet intelligentsia, were executed at the site. Many had been imprisoned in the Gulag labor camps and forced to build one of Stalin's showcase projects, the White Sea-Baltic Canal. Dmitriev made it his mission to find other graves, pieced together victims' identities and published tens of thousands of names.  He is also the organizer of an annual international commemoration of victims that attracts diplomats from countries like Ukraine, which are critical of Putin. After Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014, Kiev boycotted the event. The release of the 40,000 names in November caused a new furor. Though Dmitriev was not involved in compiling the list, he started getting anonymous calls afterwards asking if he had similar information he planned to release, Anufriev said. He was arrested on Dec. 13 by police acting on an anonymous tip, the lawyer said. Three days earlier, someone had broken into his home just as he was answering a summons to appear at a local police station to explain why he owned a hunting rifle.  His computer was accessed and 144 images of his daughter copied or printed off, Anufriev said.      An expert group called by state prosecutors told the court it believed nine of the images were pornographic. A medical expert called by the defense, Lev Shcheglov, disagreed with their assessment. In a video posted to social media, he also questioned the group's qualifications because it was made up of an art historian, a maths teacher and a pediatrician. Three of the nine images leaked to state TV were broadcast with the girl's face, breasts and pubic area blurred. They show her standing straight and alone, with bookshelves in the background. Her arms are raised in one and by her side in the other two.            Is this pornographic material? No,  Shcheglov said, and described the prosecution's case as  madness and absurdity . As for the guns charge, Anufriev said that Dmitriev owns parts of a sawn-off shotgun, but it is an old hunting rifle that doesn't fire, and no bullets have been found.

France and Germany had led efforts to create the tax, which was supposed to help recover public funds used to bail out banks in the financial crisis and to curb speculative trading. But the talks have dragged on since 2011 as countries struggle to agree what instruments should be covered and at which rate. Banks and other opponents of the tax argue that it only makes sense if it covers many countries or else transactions will shift towards financial centres not covered by it. Macron said that he would  go all the way  on the tax, adding:  I am in no way pulling back on this subject  after some EU lawmakers and NGOs accused him of just that. However, he added that it depended on whether Britain had access to EU financial markets after Brexit, because otherwise firms would move to London where the tax will not apply.  I want an FTT that can be applied in a coherent space, makes sense and is effective,  Macron told Ouest France newspaper. Ten countries - Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Greece, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain - have signed up in principle for the tax. A minimum of nine is needed under EU rules. Macron's government is pushing hard to attract finance jobs from London and promised last week to axe an tax on intra-day financial transactions that lawmakers added to the last budget bill, much to the fury of French finance firms.

The BOJ is expected to hold off from expanding stimulus at its two-day rate review ending next Thursday, as robust exports and private consumption heighten prospects of a moderate economic expansion. The central bank's nine-member board is split between those who expect a strengthening economy to start pushing up inflation, and those who believe inflation will remain subdued well into next year given Japan's sticky deflationary mindset. If the pessimists prevail, the BOJ may push back again the timing for hitting its ambitious 2 percent inflation target, sources familiar with its thinking say, in a fresh blow to Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's radical monetary experiment aimed at putting a sustained end to deflation.  It's taking longer than expected for inflation to pick up,  one of the sources said.  Sizable cuts in the price forecasts may be inevitable,  another source said, adding a delay in the projected timing for hitting the target  can't be ruled out.  Two other sources expressed a similar view, warning that the underlying weakness in inflation could hamper the BOJ's efforts to change public perceptions that deflation will persist. Kuroda is likely to remind markets of the BOJ's resolve to maintain its ultra-easy policy until inflation is sustainably above 2 percent. Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at PIMCO, expects the BOJ to maintain its yield targets well into next year.  The Federal Reserve is exiting, the European Central Bank will taper its bond purchases next year, but I think the yield target in Japan will stay in place for quite some time.  Strong Growth, Weak Inflation The BOJ is set to slash its consumer inflation forecast for the year ending in March 2018 to around 1.0 percent from the current 1.4 percent estimate made in April, the sources said. The central bank is also seen cutting next fiscal year's inflation forecast to 1.5 percent or below, from the current projection of 1.7 percent, they said. Depending on how big the cut in next year's forecast will be, the BOJ may push back the timing for hitting its target from the current estimate of  around fiscal 2018,  the sources said. In a testament to the improving economy, the BOJ will slightly revise up its economic growth forecasts for the current and following fiscal years, the sources said. The central bank will also offer a more upbeat assessment of the economy than last month to signal its growing conviction that it is expanding moderately, they said. [nL3N1J32XI] In its current forecasts, the BOJ expects gross domestic product (GDP) to expand 1.6 percent in the current fiscal year and 1.3 percent in the following year. The disparity between strong growth and low inflation will be a key topic of debate at next week's rate review, when the BOJ issues its quarterly report with new long-term projections. The board is divided between those who blame structural factors for keeping inflation weak, and those who feel a tightening job market will soon push up wages and prices. Some policymakers say companies still have room to cut back on services and streamline operations, instead of luring more employees with higher pay. Only when firms run out of areas to cut costs would they start raising wages and prices, they argue. The BOJ's report is likely to offer an analysis on why the strength in the economy hasn't translated into higher wage and price growth, the sources said. Japan's economy grew at an annualized 1.0 percent in the first quarter on solid exports and private consumption.  But core consumer prices in May rose just 0.4 percent from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's 2 percent target. Tokyo inflation, a leading indicator of nationwide prices, was flat in June from a year earlier, stunning BOJ officials who expected a stronger reading given a recent pick-up in consumption.

At least 200 people were killed in 2016, up about 10 percent from 185 in 2015, according to human rights watchdog Global Witness. In its annual report, the UK-based campaign group said the phenomenon of violence against land rights activists is not only growing but spreading, with murders recorded in 24 countries, compared to 16 nations last year. Global Witness noted that while Brazil remains the deadliest country in terms of sheer numbers, Nicaragua has overtaken Honduras as the most dangerous place for activists per capita.  This tide of violence is driven by an intensifying fight for land and natural resources, as mining, logging, hydro-electric and agricultural companies trample on people and the environment in their pursuit of profit,  the report said. Nearly 60 percent of all killings occurred in Latin America. Brazil fared worse with 49 deaths followed by Colombia with 37 activists murdered, Honduras 14 and Nicaragua 11. In the Philippines, 28 activists died defending their lands.  The report also noted a spike in killings in India which it attributed to increased police repression of peaceful protest and civic activism. The report found 33 murders were linked to mining - the bloodiest industry - while logging and defending national parks has become riskier with a rise in deaths to 23 from 15. Global Witness highlighted the vulnerability of park rangers, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo where nine were killed last year. While almost 40 percent of those murdered were indigenous, the report said, the wave of violence is not confined solely to developing nations.  Developed countries are ramping up other methods to suppress activists, notably in the United States, where environmental defenders are being given every reason to protest by the Trump administration,  the report said.  It is increasingly clear that globally, governments and companies are failing in their duty to protect activists at risk.

They were waiting for credentials to enter the World Health Organization's global tobacco treaty conference, one designed to curb smoking and combat the influence of the cigarette industry. Treaty officials didn't want them there. But still, among those lined up hoping to get in were executives from Japan Tobacco International and British American Tobacco Plc (BATS.L). There was a big name missing from the group: Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N). A Philip Morris representative later told Reuters its employees didn't turn up because the company knew it wasn't welcome. In fact, executives from the largest publicly traded tobacco firm had flown in from around the world to New Delhi for the anti-tobacco meeting. Unknown to treaty organizers, they were staying at a hotel an hour from the convention center, working from an operations room there. Philip Morris International would soon be holding secret meetings with delegates from the government of Vietnam and other treaty members. The object of these clandestine activities: the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking globally. Reuters has found that Philip Morris International is running a secretive campaign to block or weaken treaty provisions that save millions of lives by curbing tobacco use. In an internal document, the company says it supported the enactment of the treaty. But Philip Morris has come to view it as a  regulatory runaway train  driven by  anti-tobacco extremists  – a description contained in the document, a 2014 PowerPoint presentation. Confidential company documents and interviews with current and former Philip Morris employees reveal an offensive that stretches from the Americas to Africa to Asia, from hardscrabble tobacco fields to the halls of political power, in what may be one of the broadest corporate lobbying efforts in existence. Details of those plans are laid bare in a cache of Philip Morris documents reviewed by Reuters, one of the largest tobacco industry leaks ever. Reuters is publishing a selection of those papers in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) Dating from 2009 to 2016, the thousands of pages include emails between executives, PowerPoint presentations, planning papers, policy toolkits, national lobbying plans and market analyses. Taken as a whole, they present a company that has focused its vast global resources on bringing to heel the world's tobacco control treaty. Targeting the Treaty Philip Morris works to subvert the treaty on multiple levels. It targets the FCTC conferences where delegates gather to decide on anti-smoking guidelines. It also lobbies at the country level, where the makeup of FCTC delegations is determined and treaty decisions are turned into legislation. The documents, combined with reporting in 14 countries from Brazil to Uganda to Vietnam, reveal that a goal of Philip Morris is to increase the number of delegates at the treaty conventions who are not from health ministries or involved in public health. That's happening: A Reuters analysis of delegates to the FCTC's biennial conference shows a rise since the first convention in 2006 in the number of officials from ministries like trade, finance and agriculture for whom tobacco revenues can be a higher priority than health concerns. Philip Morris International says there is nothing improper about its executives engaging with government officials.  As a company in a highly regulated industry, speaking with governments is part of our everyday business,  Tony Snyder, vice president of communications, said in a statement in response to Reuters' findings.  The fact that Reuters has seen internal emails discussing our engagement with governments does not make those interactions inappropriate.  In a series of interviews in Europe and Asia, Philip Morris executive Andrew Cave said company employees are under strict instructions to obey both the company's own conduct policies and local law in the countries where they operate. Cave, a director of corporate affairs, said that while Philip Morris disagrees with some aspects of the FCTC treaty and consults with delegates offsite during its conferences, ultimately the delegations  make their own decisions.   We're respectful of the fact that this is their week and their event,  said Cave in an interview in New Delhi, as the parties to the treaty met last November. Asked in an earlier interview whether Philip Morris conducts a formal campaign targeting the treaty's biennial conferences, Cave gave a flat  no.  Health Impact When the FCTC delegates gather, lives hang in the balance. Decisions taken at the conferences over the past decade, including a ban on smoking in public places, are saving millions of lives, according to researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center. Between 2007 and 2014, more than 53 million people in 88 countries stopped smoking because those nations imposed stringent anti-smoking measures recommended by the WHO, according to their December 2016 study. Because of the treaty, an estimated 22 million smoking-related deaths will be averted, the researchers found. According to the WHO, though, tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death – and by 2030 will be responsible for eight million deaths a year, up from six million now. There was jubilation among anti-smoking advocates when the treaty was adopted in 2003. The treaty, which took effect in 2005, made it possible to push for measures that once seemed radical, such as smoke-free bars. About 90 percent of all nations eventually joined. A big holdout is the United States, which signed the treaty but has yet to ratify it. Since the FCTC came into force, it has persuaded dozens of nations to boost taxes on tobacco products, pass laws banning smoking in public places and increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. Treaty members gather every two years to consider new provisions or strengthen old ones at a meeting called the Conference of the Parties, or COP, which first convened in 2006 in Geneva. But an FCTC report shows that implementation of important sections of the treaty is stalling. There has been no further progress in the implementation of 7 out of 16  substantive  treaty articles since 2014, according to a report by the FCTC Secretariat in June last year. A key reason:  The tobacco industry continues to be the most important barrier in implementation of the Convention.  'More Powerful Than Ever' Indeed, the tobacco industry has weathered the tighter regulation. There has been only a slight 1.9 percent decline in global cigarette sales since the treaty took effect in 2005, and more people smoked daily in 2015 than a decade earlier, studies show. The Thomson Reuters Global Tobacco Index, which tracks tobacco stocks, has risen more than 100 percent in the past decade, largely due to price increases.  Some people think that with tobacco, you've won the battle,  said former Finnish Health Minister Pekka Puska, who chaired an FCTC committee last year.  No way,  he said.  The tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.  With 600 corporate affairs executives, according to a November 2015 internal email, Philip Morris has one of the world's biggest corporate lobbying arms. That army, and $7 billion-plus in annual net profit, gives Philip Morris the resources to overwhelm the FCTC. The treaty is overseen by 19 staff at a Secretariat office hosted by the WHO in Geneva. The Secretariat spends on average less than $6 million a year. Even when buttressed by anti-smoking groups, the Secretariat is outgunned. Its budget for this year and last year for supporting the treaty clause on combating tobacco company influence is less than $460,000. Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the FCTC treaty Secretariat, is the person tasked with preventing the industry from neutering the agreement. In two interviews at her Geneva office, da Costa e Silva, a medical doctor who holds a PhD in public health and has a dyed pink streak in her hair, explained why the FCTC banned attendance by any member of the public at the 2014 biennial conference in Moscow. The ban came in response to efforts by tobacco executives to use public badges to get inside the venue, she said, adding that industry representatives then started borrowing badges from delegates they knew to gain entry.  It's a real war,  said da Costa e Silva. But she had only a partial picture of the forces ranged against her. She wasn't aware of the fact that Philip Morris had a large team operating throughout the convention in Moscow, or the details of its activities in New Delhi last November.  This is so disgusting. These are the forces against which we have to work,  da Costa e Silva said in May after being told about the Philip Morris documents.  I think they want to implode the treaty.  Tobacco Outrage     The idea of a global tobacco treaty had been discussed among health advocates since at least 1979, when a WHO committee suggested the possibility. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway who became director-general of the WHO in 1998, made it happen. Related CoverageExclusive: Documents reveal Philip Morris' campaign to subvert the world's anti-smoking treatyShe was aided by outrage over documents that surfaced as part of the landmark 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, in which the four largest U.S. tobacco companies agreed to pay more than $200 billion to 46 U.S. states. The internal communications showed that tobacco executives lied for years about their knowledge of the deadly nature of cigarettes. A 1989 document revealed one company's plan to fight threats to the industry.  WHO's impact and influence is indisputable,  the document said. It went on to contemplate  countermeasures designed to contain/neutralize/re-orient the WHO.  That company was Philip Morris. In 2008, Altria Group Inc (MO.N) split up its Philip Morris business. Philip Morris USA, which remains a subsidiary of Altria, sells Marlboro and other brands in the United States. Philip Morris International was spun off, and handles business abroad. Since the split, Philip Morris International shares have more than doubled and Altria's have more than tripled. Philip Morris International's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, down the street from a patch of Gallo-Roman ruins, in a sleek building with a cafeteria, gym and a patio facing Lake Geneva. From there, the company is working to hobble the treaty. Internal company communications reveal the scope of Philip Morris' operation during the 2014 FCTC treaty meeting in Moscow. The company set up a  Coordinating Room  that could seat 42 people, according to the 2014 PowerPoint presentation, titled  Corporate affairs approach and issues.  Leading the operation was executive Chris Koddermann. Formerly a lawyer and lobbyist in Canada, Koddermann joined Philip Morris in 2010. He is now a director of regulatory affairs in Lausanne. The PowerPoint describes the ideal corporate affairs executive as someone who is able to  play the political game.  Koddermann previously worked for federal and provincial cabinet ministers in Canada, according to his LinkedIn profile. Reached on his cell phone in March, Koddermann said he wouldn't be able to meet and that any questions should be directed to Philip Morris International. Congratulatory Email At the end of the Moscow meeting, on Oct. 18, 2014, Koddermann sent an email congratulating a 33-person Philip Morris team on their success in diluting or blocking measures intended to strengthen tobacco controls and reduce cigarette sales. The gains he touted at the end of the week-long conference were the culmination of a two-year effort, his email said. The documents shed light on one key objective in Philip Morris' FCTC campaign: Keep tobacco within the ambit of international trade deals, so that the company has a way to mount legal campaigns against tobacco regulations. In Moscow, one proposal initially called for carving out tobacco from trade pacts. International trade treaties often include provisions, such as the protection of trademarks, that Philip Morris has used to challenge anti-smoking measures. If tobacco were taken out of the treaties, as suggested by the proposal, Philip Morris could be deprived of many such legal arguments. An early draft asked parties to support efforts to exclude tobacco from trade pacts and to prevent the industry from  abusing  trade and investment rules. In the end, the proposal was watered down. The final decision only reminded parties of  the possibility to take into account their public health objectives in their negotiation of trade and investment agreements.  There was no mention of excluding tobacco. Koddermann, in his email to colleagues on the last day of the conference, declared victory, describing the change as  a tremendous outcome.  Overall, the company achieved its  trade related campaign objectives,  including  avoiding a declaration of health over trade  and  avoiding the recognition of the FCTC as an international standard,  he wrote. The win was significant. A former Philip Morris employee said the company has routinely used trade treaties to challenge tobacco control laws. The aim, he said, was  to scare governments away from doing regulatory changes.  Even though the tobacco industry has lost a series of major legal battles, its suits have served to discourage the implementation of regulations that curb smoking. Those delays can yield years of unimpeded sales. As the Philip Morris PowerPoint presentation from 2014 put it:  Roadblocks are as important as solutions.  'Watered Down' One roadblock was a campaign to stop the 2011 introduction of rules in Australia banning logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The company's litigation and arbitration against the measure ultimately were dismissed – but not before five countries filed complaints against Australia on the same subject at the World Trade Organization. The global trade body has yet to announce a decision in the matter.

To match Special Report PMI-WHO/FCTCKen Cedeno/File PhotoThe attempt to undo Australia's regulations has had a chilling effect elsewhere. It slowed the introduction of plain-packaging rules in New Zealand. Citing the risk that tobacco companies may  mount legal challenges,  the government announced in 2013 that it was postponing the move and waiting to  see what happens with Australia's legal cases.  The legislation is now scheduled to go into effect next year. In his Moscow conference email, Koddermann also expressed pleasure at the fate of a proposal on farmers. Initial language would have recommended that countries restrict support for tobacco growers. The proposal was  significantly watered down,  he wrote.  This is a very positive result.  Gustavo Bosio, at the time a manager for international trade, chimed in a few days after the conference in an email:  These excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow.  Philip Morris isn't alone in seeking to weaken the treaty. Ahead of the 2012 FCTC conference, in Seoul, four cigarette giants – Philip Morris, British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Brands Plc (IMB.L) – formed an  informal industry Working Group  to oppose various proposals on tobacco taxation, according to an internal BAT document reviewed by Reuters. The 45-page paper, whose existence hasn't been previously reported, noted that the group would coordinate  to the extent that these issues do not raise any anti-competitive concerns.  The paper outlined a global campaign planned by BAT to counter the FCTC, which was  increasingly going beyond  its mandate. And it listed objectives, including a bid to block discussions around the introduction of a minimum 70 percent tax on tobacco. BAT declined to answer questions about the industry working group. Both Imperial and Japan Tobacco International said they didn't want to comment on a document from a competitor. Japan Tobacco International said its tax experts met with counterparts from other tobacco companies to discuss treaty guidelines on taxation ahead of the 2012 conference. Philip Morris did not comment on the document. Wooing Delegates The Philip Morris emails and documents don't explicitly detail how the company pulled off the victories in Moscow. But they provide insight into the importance it places on wooing delegates. The FCTC traditionally makes decisions by consensus, and so influencing a single national delegation can have an outsized impact. The treaty has a key clause meant to keep the industry from unduly influencing delegations. Article 5.3, as it's known, says nations should protect their public health policies from tobacco interests. Guidelines that accompany Article 5.3 recommend that countries interact with the industry only when  strictly necessary.  But the article – a single sentence – contains a loophole Philip Morris has exploited. The sentence ends with the words  in accordance with national law,  opening the door to arguments by pro-tobacco forces that any lobbying that's legal in a certain country is permissible when interacting with that country's representatives. They also argue that a sentence in a related document, the guidelines for Article 5.3, allows for such interactions to take place as long as they are conducted transparently. One of the company's targets has been Vietnam. The day the Moscow meeting ended, Koddermann received an email from his colleague Nguyen Thanh Ky, a leading corporate affairs executive for Vietnam. Ky said he had a  debrief lunch  with the Vietnamese delegation and had a good outcome to report: The delegation was in favor of  moderate and reasonable measures  to be implemented over a  practical timeline,  he wrote. He did not specify which measures they discussed. The Vietnamese delegation spoke up often during the Moscow meeting. A review of notes compiled by tobacco-control groups accredited as observers showed Vietnam's interjections frequently mirrored Philip Morris' positions on tobacco-control regulations. Just like the tobacco giant, the Vietnamese said a higher tax on cigarettes would lead to more illicit sales. Like Philip Morris, they said the FCTC should stay out of trade disputes. And like Philip Morris, they opposed proposals to set uniform parameters for the legal liability of tobacco companies. The FCTC guidelines on taxation did ultimately include a WHO recommendation for a minimum tax of 70 percent – something Philip Morris opposed. But the proposal to give the treaty more sway over trade disputes was weakened, and measures to strengthen the legal liability of cigarette companies were delayed. Vietnam's foreign ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters. Secret Rendezvous As soon as the conference ended, the documents show, Philip Morris turned to the next one: the 2016 meeting in India. Slideshow (17 Images)The 2014 PowerPoint presentation outlined the need to identify ways to gather intelligence during the Delhi conference. In a separate 2015 planning document, the company talks about the arrangement of farmer protests in the run-up to the meeting. Such protests did take place – including one in front of WHO offices in New Delhi. Reuters couldn't determine whether Philip Morris was behind those demonstrations. While other major tobacco companies also sent people to Delhi in November, Philip Morris was distinguished by its stealth. Executives from the company did not sign in with their tobacco industry colleagues at the FCTC convention center and stayed at a hotel about an hour's drive away. The anonymity and distance helped Philip Morris approach delegates covertly. On the second day of the conference, a white Toyota van pulled away from the front of the Hyatt Regency hotel – where Philip Morris had its operations room – and headed for the FCTC treaty venue. The van was carrying Ky, its corporate affairs executive from Vietnam. Ky's driver talked his way past police at the barricade outside the conference center, where FCTC-issued credentials were checked, explaining that he was driving  VIPs,  the driver later told Reuters. A few minutes later, a man in a dark suit walked out of the conference center, passed the van and stopped at a street corner. The van did a U-turn, and a Reuters reporter saw the man in the suit quickly climb in. He was a senior member of Vietnam's delegation to the FCTC conference: Nguyen Vinh Quoc, a Vietnamese government official. The driver, Kishore Kumar, said in an interview that he dropped the two men off at a local hotel. Kumar said that on several other occasions that week, he took Ky to pick up people from the Hotel Formule1, a budget lodging where Vietnam's delegation was staying during the conference. Ky and Quoc did not respond to requests for comment. Asked by Reuters about the interaction between Ky and the Vietnam representatives, Philip Morris executive Andrew Cave thumped on the table in a bar at the hotel where company representatives were staying. Reuters should focus, he said, on efforts by the industry to develop so-called reduced-risk products – those that deliver nicotine without the burning of tobacco and which the company says reduce harm. When pressed about the meetings with Vietnam, Cave thumped the table again:  I'm angry that you're focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.  In a subsequent email, Cave said:  Representatives from Philip Morris International met with delegates from Vietnam  during the Delhi conference  to discuss policy issues and this complied fully with PMI's internal procedures and the laws and regulations of Vietnam.  Delegates, Cave said in separate interviews, are reluctant to meet openly with Philip Morris because they are afraid of being  named and shamed  by anti-smoking groups. 'Slavery Ended a Long Time Ago' Some delegates questioned the extent to which Philip Morris shaped the decisions made at the Moscow conference, saying attendees genuinely disagreed on certain issues. Nuntavarn Vichit-Vadakan, a Thai delegate, oversaw many discussions as the chair of an FCTC committee at the Moscow conference. She said delegates differed over the regulation of e-cigarettes, for instance, and any lobbying the company carried out would not have determined the outcome. The Philip Morris documents leave questions unanswered. In some cases, the documents show the company hatching plans to change an anti-smoking regulation or to monitor activists, but don't always make clear to what extent or how the plans were executed, if at all. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation called for  achieving scrutiny  of tobacco control advocates and said a  global project team  had been established for this purpose. It did not list what means would be used. In some instances, Philip Morris' lobbying plainly failed. In July 2015, the Ugandan parliament passed sweeping new anti-tobacco laws inspired by the treaty. All that was needed was President Yoweri Museveni's signature, and the small African nation would become a leader on the continent in implementing a strict interpretation of the FCTC. Philip Morris sent an executive, a younger white man, to tell the septuagenarian president, who long ago had helped topple dictator Idi Amin, why the tobacco act was a bad idea. Sheila Ndyanabangi, Uganda's lead health official for tobacco issues who was present at the meeting, described the executive's approach as lecturing the statesman.  He said, 'Ugandan tobacco will be too expensive' and 'it will not be competitive,'  Ndyanabangi said. Her account was confirmed by a senior Ugandan government official who was also present. Museveni stared for a moment at the Philip Morris executive and a representative from a major tobacco buyer who'd come with him. The president then declared:  Slavery ended a long time ago.  There was a long silence in the room, recalled Ndyanabangi. Museveni said Uganda didn't need tobacco, and the meeting was over. The president signed the bill that September. Museveni's office did not respond to requests for comment. Changing the Delegations Over time, however, the industry's lobbying has slowed the treaty's progress. At the biennial conferences, the discussions have changed. In Moscow, for instance, there was a strong focus on trade and taxes.  You could see from the floor that interventions were very, very, very much focusing on the trade aspects, many times even putting trade over health,  the FCTC's da Costa e Silva said in an interview last year. The composition of FCTC delegations sent by governments has changed to include more members who aren't involved in health policy. That's in line with what Philip Morris and other tobacco companies want: Philip Morris, as well as British American Tobacco, has sought to move the balance of the membership away from public health officials and toward ministries like finance and trade. Such agencies, said the former Philip Morris executive, benefit from tobacco tax revenues and attach less weight to health concerns.  The health department would just want tobacco to be banned, while for the finance ministry it's more like how can we leverage or get as much money as we can,  he said. The object of Philip Morris' efforts, according to the 2014 PowerPoint on corporate affairs, is to  move tobacco issues away  from health ministries and demonstrate there are broader public interests at play – that  it's not about tobacco.  Cave, the Philip Morris corporate affairs executive, confirmed the company tries to persuade governments to change the composition of delegations. Health officials, he said, aren't equipped to handle the intricacies of issues such as taxation.  You're looking at illicit trade, you're looking at tax regimes, you're looking at international law,  he said.  Now each of these areas, it's logical, if you want to really tackle the trade and tobacco smuggling, illicit trade, who would you go to? You wouldn't go to the health ministry.  Reuters analyzed the rosters of the almost 3,500 accredited delegation members who have attended the seven FCTC conferences since 2006. The analysis found that there were more than six health delegates for every finance-related delegate in 2006. In Delhi last year, that ratio had fallen to just over three health delegates for every finance delegate. The number of delegates from finance, agriculture and trade fields has risen from a few dozen in 2006 to more than 100 in recent years. Vietnam's delegation, for example, has changed markedly. At the first FCTC conference in 2006, none of its four delegates were from finance or trade ministries. By 2014, in Moscow, there were 13 delegates, with at least four from finance-related ministries, including the chief delegate. Vietnam's foreign ministry did not respond to questions about the delegation. Da Costa e Silva isn't opposed to having delegates from trade ministries, but she says their primary focus needs to be on health. And she was concerned by the makeup of the Vietnamese delegation. In a letter to the Vietnamese prime minister in late 2015, she asked that tobacco industry employees be excluded from the delegation. If they weren't, she wrote, Vietnam might be  unable to play a full part in discussions.  In 2016, Vietnam brought 11 delegates to the conference, of whom six were from health agencies, including the chief representative. Some tobacco-control activists who attended the Delhi meeting in November say it was the worst so far in terms of passing new anti-smoking provisions. Matthew Myers, who heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said multiple countries came prepared to consciously block action. He said he heard delegates making arguments  I haven’t heard in 25 years.  A Nigerian delegate, for instance, asked to remove a reference to  the tobacco epidemic  from a draft proposal on liability for tobacco-related harm, according to notes taken by anti-smoking groups. Asked for comment, Christiana Ukoli, head of the delegation in Delhi, said the  Nigerian delegation strongly dissociates itself from [that] statement.  The Delhi conference ended as it began, with treaty Secretariat officials not knowing where Philip Morris had been or what it had done. The company had flown in a team of executives, used a squad of identical vans to ferry officials in New Delhi, and then left town without a trace.

Taiwan's most valuable company said that new gadget launches in the second half, particularly smartphones, will help boost its revenue for the quarter ending in September by at least 15 percent versus the June quarter, which suffered from the appreciation of the Taiwanese currency against the U.S. dollar.        Almost 100 percent of our revenue is in US dollars...In the last two quarters, the appreciation has had a very big impact on our revenue,  Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told reporters on Thursday. TSMC, which has a market capitalization that exceeds Intel Corp's (INTC.O), said revenue for the July-September quarter will be between $8.12 billion and $8.22 billion, compared to the $7.06 billion posted for the April-June quarter. TSMC and its rivals are riding a boom in demand for chips that power smartphones and computer servers, driving sharp gains in their shares. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) last week estimated a record quarterly operating profit for April-June.  Apple is gearing up to launch its 10th anniversary iPhone, and analysts expect TSMC and some other suppliers to benefit from it. TSMC's revenue forecast came as its second-quarter net profit fell 8.6 percent to T$66.27 billion ($2.19 billion) from T$72.51 billion in the year-ago quarter. That compared to the T$68.44 billion average forecast of 22 analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. The company said that from this quarter it will offer revenue guidance in U.S. dollar terms, a departure from denoting it in Taiwan dollars. Revenue in U.S. dollars fell 5.9 percent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, but was up 3.2 percent from a year ago, it said. Reporting by Jess Macy Yu and J.R.

In testimony delivered to Congress on Wednesday, U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the Fed would not need to raise rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the neutral fed funds rate. ECB policy maker Ilmars Rimsevics said on Thursday that quantitative easing could continue for another couple of years given low inflation, pushing the euro to a one-week low. That brought some comfort to bond markets unnerved in the past two weeks by signs that major central banks are stepping up efforts to unwind ultra-loose monetary policies - the Bank of Canada on Wednesday delivered its first rate hike in nearly seven years.  The nuances in Yellen's speech were slightly on the dovish side so people are taking that as an excuse to buy back into the bond market,  said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking Committee later on Thursday and her comments are expected to be broadly in line with those made on Wednesday. U.S. Treasuries have given up half of the yield rise and German Bund yields over a quarter seen after comments by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi in Portugal on June 27. Draghi's comments triggered a sharp selloff in bond markets, pushing prices down and yields up. But on Thursday, Germany's 10-year Bund yield fell 3 basis points to a one-week low of 0.477 percent. Just a week ago it shot decisively above 0.5 percent on rising expectations for tighter ECB monetary policy. Other euro zone bond yields were down 2-5 basis points on the day, with Italian bond yields giving up earlier rises after a debt auction. Italy sold 7.25 billion euros in debt - at the top of its planned range. Data highlighting subdued inflation in the euro zone also suggests there is no rush for the ECB to scale back its monetary stimulus and should support bond markets, analysts said. Annual inflation in Germany, harmonised to compare with other European countries, was confirmed at 1.5 percent in June. Year-on-year inflation in France eased to a seven-month low of 0.8 percent in June, unchanged from a preliminary estimate.  The inflation numbers in Germany are somewhat cheering, but it is all about the overall picture for the euro zone,  said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK.  It indicates that inflationary pressure is subdued. Hence, there is no rush in changing the gear for monetary policy.

Southeast Asia's third-largest economy has for several years been weighing the competing merits of France's Rafale jet and the Eurofighter Typhoon, built by Britain's BAE Systems, as it looks to buy up to 18 jets to replace its Russian MiG-29 fighters - nearly half of which are grounded. The Rafale fighter - built by Dassault Aviation SA - was until recently seen as the frontrunner, with the support of key officials in Malaysia's defense ministry. But Malaysia has shelved those plans for now as it looks to boost aerial surveillance that will be critical in its fight against militancy, a defense ministry source told Reuters. The decision comes as Islamist fighters continue to battle security forces in Marawi in the southern Philippines. Malaysia and Indonesia, which share the nearby island of Borneo, are working with the Philippines to conduct air and maritime patrols along their shared borders in the Sulu Sea.  With regards to Rafale, France is still pushing for it as evidenced during the recent air show in Paris,  said the source, on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media on the discussions.  However, due to the current situation, Malaysia is focusing more on maritime patrol aircraft rather than multi-role combat aircraft.  More than 400 people have been killed in fighting in Marawi,  on the Philippine island of Mindanao, which was seized by pro-Islamic State militants on May 23. The crisis in Marawi has unnerved governments across Southeast Asia, worried the region could potentially become the next base for the Islamic State, especially with fighters returning home from Iraq after the fall of the group's Mosul stronghold. Besides conducting joint patrols, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia have also agreed to pool intelligence and tackle militant financing. Temporarily Suspended FILE PHOTO: A EADS Eurofighter Typhoon jet lands at the Swiss Army Airbase in Emmen, central Switzerland November 14, 2008.Michael Buholzer/File PhotoDiscussions for fighter jet procurements typically take years and an impending general election, which must be called by June 2018 but is expected this year, was already expected to delay Malaysia's final decision.  The source said Malaysia's jet fighter talks were only  temporarily suspended  and could resume in the future, but the priority was to secure new surveillance planes by 2020. Malaysia's decision to suspend its jet fighter acquisition program will come as a blow to Dassault's Rafale and the Eurofighter Typhoon, the two main competitors for the deal to replace the Royal Malaysian Air Force's (RMAF) squadron of Russian MiG-29s. Spokesmen for Dassault and Eurofighter, a consortium including Airbus BAE Systems and Leonardo of Italy, declined to comment. BAE Systems did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Slideshow (2 Images)Prime Minister Najib Razak said in March that the Rafale deal was discussed during then French President Francois Hollande's visit to the Southeast Asian nation, but that Malaysia was  not ready yet to make a decision . Dassault was awarded a contract in September last year to deliver 36 Rafale jets to India, and hopes to make additional sales to New Delhi. Dassault Chief Executive Eric Trappier said in May that the company was  notably in talks  with Malaysia and India to secure one new contract by 2018. BAE Systems, which leads the regional sales campaign for the Typhoon, is looking to kick off its entry into Southeast Asia with the sale of its multi-role combat aircraft to Malaysia. Malaysia has four Beechcraft BT200T surveillance aircraft, but one of the planes crashed in December killing the pilot. The defense ministry source said Kuala Lumpur was looking at acquiring four more surveillance planes that were larger and had a longer range than its existing assets, such as aircraft built by Lockheed Martin.  We're looking at a commercial-based platform, which is more affordable, compared to a military specific platform,  the source said.

The service, to be called Alticebank, would add another layer to the company's businesses, which have already grown beyond telecoms with the acquisition of broadcast distribution rights as well as online video advertising marketplace Teads.  The move also highlights the heightened competition in retail financial services, with mobile operators seeing the increase in smartphone ownership and the lower use of bank branches as an opportunity to challenge traditional lenders. Altice, a holding company based in the Netherlands, has expanded rapidly through a series of debt-financed buyouts in the United States and Europe. It owns France's second-biggest telecoms firm SFR Group and Portugal's biggest.  It's the first one on a European level, but certainly not the last one,  Julien Maldonato, a partner at Deloitte in Paris, said referring to online banks launched by telecoms companies.  The logic is to make the heavy telecoms infrastructure profitable,  he said. French rival Orange, which is testing an online bank, hopes to launch it nationwide to take on traditional banks with a low-cost services that will eventually expand to include loans and insurance. The service, Orange Bank, aims to break even in four to five years and was formed after the former telecoms monopoly bought 65 percent of Groupama Banque last year. The nationwide launch was postponed last month, however, to allow for additional testing. A union official pointed at the time to issues with the quality of the user interface and customer service. The Orange plan for France contrasts with Altice's current strategy, under which its new banking service would be built from scratch and need to go through a complex regulatory compliance process.  Altice has requested a banking license from the European Central Bank (ECB), the source said, confirming an earlier report by newspaper Le Parisien.  The ECB declined to comment.

Taiwan's most valuable company said that new gadget launches in the second half, particularly smartphones, will help boost its revenue for the quarter ending in September by at least 15 percent versus the June quarter, which suffered from the appreciation of the Taiwanese currency against the U.S. dollar.        Almost 100 percent of our revenue is in US dollars...In the last two quarters, the appreciation has had a very big impact on our revenue,  Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told reporters on Thursday. TSMC, which has a market capitalization that exceeds Intel Corp's (INTC.O), said revenue for the July-September quarter will be between $8.12 billion and $8.22 billion, compared to the $7.06 billion posted for the April-June quarter. TSMC and its rivals are riding a boom in demand for chips that power smartphones and computer servers, driving sharp gains in their shares. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) last week estimated a record quarterly operating profit for April-June.  Apple is gearing up to launch its 10th anniversary iPhone, and analysts expect TSMC and some other suppliers to benefit from it. TSMC's revenue forecast came as its second-quarter net profit fell 8.6 percent to T$66.27 billion ($2.19 billion) from T$72.51 billion in the year-ago quarter. That compared to the T$68.44 billion average forecast of 22 analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. The company said that from this quarter it will offer revenue guidance in U.S. dollar terms, a departure from denoting it in Taiwan dollars. Revenue in U.S. dollars fell 5.9 percent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, but was up 3.2 percent from a year ago, it said. Reporting by Jess Macy Yu and J.R.

The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 22 June 2017 and follows the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. The rating on the euro notes includes a one notch uplift from SMRP BV's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) arising from security over assets in key SMRP BV group subsidiaries, which will be shared equally with existing secured notes and bank debt. SMRP BV intends to use the proceeds to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. The one-notch uplift applied to the euro notes may be removed if the superior secured debt falls below a EUR110 million threshold (upon exercise of call options available for EUR500 million and USD400 million secured notes) and a subsequent amendment to the intercreditor agreement, which will require approval of the existing bank lenders, paves the way for the release of security over the assets - as defined in the bond documentation. This  fall-away  security structure, which could materialise in 2019 at the earliest, may allow up to EUR110 million of secured debt ranking superior to the notes. However, Fitch believes the low secured debt threshold defined as a precondition for the release of security in comparison with SMRP BV's EBITDA (more than EUR300 million in the financial year ended March 2017 (FY17)) will limit the secured debt/consolidated operating EBITDA ratio to below 2.0x-2.5x, which is commensurate with Fitch's guidelines for low structural subordination. As a result, the senior unsecured debt in the resultant debt structure will not face significant subordination. KEY RATING DRIVERS Linkages to Samvardhana Motherson Group:  Fitch analyses Motherson Sumi Systems Limited (MSSL), its largest shareholder Samvardhana Motherson International Limited (SMIL) and their 51:49 joint venture, SMRP BV, as a single economic entity, as SMIL effectively controls more than 50% of the economic interest in the MSSL group and because of the companies' senior management overlap. Fitch assesses the operating, financial and strategic linkages between SMRP BV and SMIL as strong and has based SMRP BV's IDR on SMIL's consolidated financial profile, which has been adjusted to include 100% of the businesses of MSSL and SMRP BV to take into account the large minority shareholders in MSSL. Leading Player with Integrated Capability: MSSL's business in India supplies wiring harnesses for a dominant share of passenger vehicles manufactured in the country. The company's acquisition of PKC Group Plc in March 2017 has given MSSL a leading position in the commercial-vehicle wiring harness market across North America, Europe, South America and China. SMRP BV's mirror business under Samvardhana Motherson Reflectec (SMR) is one of the top global suppliers of exterior mirrors, with a 24% market share by sales. Samvardhana Motherson Peguform (SMP), the polymer business, accounts for 20% of global bumper sales, 11% of dashboard sales and 28% of door panel sales in the premium segment. MSSL's market share has increased over the last several years, supported by its ability to provide a full spectrum of solutions, including R&D;, tooling, manufacturing and assembly, to meet customers' complex supply-chain needs with high quality and reliability. Well-Diversified Business Profile: MSSL's businesses serve over 750 vehicle programmes across more than 50 original equipment manufacturers (OEM) globally. Each business is diversified across OEM customers, vehicle programmes within an OEM and geography for each programme. This is an important business strength, given the cyclical and competitive nature of the automotive industry. MSSL has a balanced geographic presence: 20.7% of sales came from the Americas, 53.7% from Europe and 25.7% from Asia-Pacific and Africa in FY17, including full-year revenue from PKC. Customer diversification has improved, with the top-five customers making up 47% of sales in FY17 (including PKC), compared with 53% in FY14. Strong Relationship with OEMs:  SMRP BV has decades-long relationships with 14 of the top-15 global OEMs, which underscores its consistent quality and R&D; record. This is important, as global OEMs are increasingly dependent on external auto-component providers and retain only high value-added parts to optimise capital. The company's solid customer relationships are a key business strength and help SMRP BV mitigate sector-specific risks, such as competition and weak negotiating power against large OEMs in pricing and pass-through of volatility in raw material prices. Strong Order Book: SMRP BV had an order book of EUR12.9 billion at FYE17 (FYE14: EUR7.7 billion), which Fitch believes supports revenue visibility in excess of 90% over the next three to four years, including 60%-70% that comes from models already in production. The order book is diversified across OEMs and vehicle programmes, mitigating uncertainty over the market reception of new launches. The association with top OEMs also reduces this risk, as manufacturers typically try to improvise and relaunch new platforms - which require significant upfront investment - rather than writing-off the initial investment altogether. Low-Risk Growth Strategy: SMRP BV has achieved strong, profitable growth by successfully integrating attractively priced acquisitions and a low-risk organic expansion strategy. The company has been able to improve profitability at SMR and SMP by focusing on cost efficiency and investing to expand in-house manufacturing capabilities. SMRP BV's expansion plans benefit from orders already secured from customers, lowering risk. MSSL is likely to make large acquisitions in line with its strategic vision, but Fitch expects the company to adhere to its announced long-term leverage target. Improving Financial Profile: MSSL has maintained reasonable financial leverage, with an adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR ratio of 2.6x in FY14-FY16, while achieving healthy growth and steady margin improvement. This highlights its disciplined approach in evaluating investment opportunities. The company has low maintenance capex requirements (INR6 billion-7 billion annually) and a dividend policy that pays less than 40% of net income. FCF generation has been negative due to organic expansion of SMR and SMP, but Fitch expects FCF generation to improve once capex normalises over FY18-FY19. Fitch expects MSSL's robust order book to support continued EBITDA increases, which should lower financial leverage to levels commensurate with a low investment-grade rating over the next two to three years. Solid Financial Flexibility: MSSL benefits from a robust liquidity profile, long-dated debt maturities and diversified access to banks and capital markets. MSSL's strong financial flexibility allows it to support customers when they set up production facilities in new markets and be involved in early design and development work. DERIVATION SUMMARY MSSL's large scale, leading market position in its product categories and adequate diversification across OEM customers, geographies and products positions it well with respect to peers such as Metalsa, S.A. de C.V. (BBB-/Stable), Nemak, S.A.B. de C.V.(BB+/Positive) and Faurecia S.A. (BB/Stable). MSSL appears more leveraged than peers because of its expansion capex, but Fitch's forecasts for the company's FCF profitability and leverage profile in the post-expansion years (FY20 onwards) compare well against peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - High single-digit revenue growth (except FY18, when full-year consolidation of PKC will lead to around 21% growth), supported by a strong order book. -  Gradual EBITDA margin improvement to 10%-11% over the next two to three years, driven by increasing scale and investments to improve in-house value addition. - Capex intensity, measured as percentage of sales, to remain high at around 5.5%-6.0% through to FY18, before declining to around 4.0% in FY19. - MSSL dividend payout to remain below 40% of net income. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - MSSL consolidated adjusted net leverage - defined as total adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR, after Fitch's adjustment for minorities and factored receivables and suppliers' acceptances - improving to below 2.0x on a sustained basis. - MSSL consolidated FCF margin improving to greater than 1.0% on a sustained basis. - MSSL maintaining or improving its business diversification. Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to the Outlook being revised to Stable: - Inability to achieve the positive guidelines above. LIQUIDITY MSSL has a robust liquidity position, with no significant debt maturities before FY22. The company had INR49.9 billion of unrestricted cash and INR32.9 billion of available committed bank facilities at end-March 2017 (MSSL: INR8.9 billion; SMRP BV: INR24 billion). This was more than sufficient to meet INR10.6 billion in near-term debt maturities and the modest level of FCF deficit through to FY18. The liquidity profile is strengthened by Fitch's expectation of positive FCF from FY19 and SMRP BV's access to both bank and international debt capital markets.

Superintendent of Police Mubarak Shah, 56, was killed en route to his office when four gunmen riding on motorcycles attacked his vehicle, said city police officer Muhammad Sultan.  The head and upper parts of all the four victims were targeted,  said Sultan, adding that one policeman was critically wounded. A faction of the Pakistani Taliban, known as Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, carried out the attack, according to the faction's spokesman, Asad Mansur.  Islamic State (IS) also claimed the attack on it Amaq News Agency website. Jamaat ur Ahrar and IS have in the past jointly claimed responsibility for attacks in Pakistan. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack, his office said. It was second such attack in a week targeting senior police officers in the volatile Baluchistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. Quetta is the provincial capital. A suicide bomber on Monday killed a district police chief and his guard in the town of Chaman on the Afghan border. The Pakistani Taliban claimed that bombing in text messages and emails to media. Violence in Baluchistan has raised concern about security for projects in the $57-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a planned transport and energy link from western China to Pakistan's southern deep-water port of Gwadar. Resource-rich Baluchistan has long been plagued by insurgencies by separatists. Islamist groups such as the Taliban and Islamic State also carry out attacks in the region.  Islamist militants have killed thousands of people in Pakistan over the last decade or more, in their bid to impose hardline rule.

The new rules, called IFRS 9, come into effect at the start of next year. They change the way banks make provisions for bad and non-performing loans, and aim to make them provision for potential losses at an earlier stage than under current accounting treatment. Banks have already warned it could significantly increase how much they have to set aside, and they are expected to give more details at upcoming results. The new accounting rules could impact the lending practices of banks, according to a study of about 50 banks carried out by the European Banking Authority. The EBA's impact assessment also showed 72% of those banks expect IFRS 9 to increase volatility in their profit and loss accounts. The study showed banks expect their CET1 capital ratios to decline by 45bp on average, which is less than an average decline of 59bp in the EBA's previous impact assessment released last year. It is a more moderate impact than some in the industry had predicted. A transition or phase-in of the full impact is also expected to be allowed, although European authorities have not yet finalised how that will work. But it still marks a significant drop in capital ratios at a time when regulators continue to encourage banks to build them up and stronger banks want to increase their dividend payouts. Small banks expect to be harder hit. The average impact at smaller banks in the EBA study was 78bp, compared with 33bp at large banks. That is mainly because smaller banks use a standardised approach to measuring credit risk, compared to the internal ratings-based approach used by large banks. Seven banks surveyed, including six smaller banks, estimated the impact on their CET1 or total capital ratio would be above 75bp. The new accounting rules will increase provisions by 13% on average across the banks, down from 18% estimated in the previous assessment, the EBA said. But in this area smaller banks expect to less affected: they expect provisions to rise by 5% on average, compared with a 15% rise at large banks.

When a student steps out in front of the bus it slows down until she passes. Then it picks up pace again.  I think that the system enhances safety just like the subway,  Sam Tu, an alumni at National Taiwan University in Taipei, said recently on a test ride of the French-made EZ10 driverless electric bus. Tu, who came with his mother and father for their first ride in a driverless vehicle, said that like a subway system, the EZ10 gets passengers from one point to another on a dedicated, predictable route and was good for the environment.  Nevertheless, consumers need time to adapt,  Tu said. On its short, carefully planned route on a clear day, the EZ10, manufactured by French autonomous driving company EasyMile SAS, easily completed its test circuit.  It can be the first mile or last mile connection with the bus or with the metro,  said Martin Ting, chief of Taiwan-based 7Starlake Co, which is aiming to bring the compact driverless bus to Taiwan and set up an assembly site on the island. Unexpected complications, like having to make a detour if something strays into its path, or how it would perform in rain or at night, still have to be incorporated into the feasibility tests. But the aim is to make the EZ10, which can carry up to a dozen passengers, operational at several locations later next year, Ting said, with the initial target being campuses and public transport links. For Tu's mother, Tsai Chiu-kei, not having a temperamental driver at the wheel could be a good thing.  A taxi has a driver, but sometimes they go so fast and don't slow down even when I tell them to,  she said. (Reporting by J.R.

The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets told employees in its technology division to  exercise judgment in determining when to adapt to business attire,  according to an internal memo from late June seen by Reuters on Thursday. It did not specify whether hoodies or sneakers, the ad-hoc uniform of millennial tech workers, constitute acceptable dress. The move, one of the first by Goldman's new chief information officer Elisha Wiesel, comes as the bank makes a push to recruit and keep hold of top tech talent in the face of intensifying competition.  FILE PHOTO: A Goldman Sachs sign is displayed inside the company's post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 18, 2017.Brendan McDermidGoldman and other Wall Street banks have been struggling for years to compete for the best employees with Silicon Valley firms and hedge funds, which often have better hours and workplace perks for top software developers and engineers.  Wiesel replaced Martin Chavez, now the firm's chief financial officer, as Goldman's highest ranking technology executive in January.  About a quarter of Goldman's 33,000 employees are engineers who have helped transform the firm since the 2007-2009 financial crisis by making trading more efficient and building new businesses such as its consumer lending platform called Marcus.  The majority of the bank's employees still adhere to a professional business dress code unless told otherwise by their group's manager.  Other banks are also relaxing dress codes. Last year, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said it would allow employees to wear business-casual attire on most occasions. In 2013, Barclays Plc (BARC.L) started to allow casual Fridays.

The overall mood was one of relief that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen had not sounded more hawkish in her appearance before Congress the previous day, a green light for risk-taking. Wall Street was expected to ring in another record peak for the Dow Jones Industrial Average when it resumes as the dollar pries itself off a nine-month low just in time for day two of Yellen's semi-annual Washington grilling. The star performer overnight had been the Canadian dollar, which rocketed to 11-month highs after the country's central bank hiked interest rates for the first time in seven years and left the door wide open to further moves. Sentiment got another boost when China reported upbeat data on exports and imports for June, the latest sign that global trade is finding some traction again. It had helped push Asian shares up more than 1 percent and lift MSCI's 47-country world index to its latest record high, and though it took a while, Europe's main bourses eventually muscled higher too. Traders there began hoovering up banks stocks again after a 1.6 percent gain on Wednesday had given the regional STOXX 600 its best day since April's French election victory for Emmanuel Macron.  It mostly seems to be down to Yellen,  Rabobank quantitative analyst Bas Van Geffen said.  The fact that it seems like the Fed is going to take it slowly is being seen as a good sign by the equity markets and by the currency markets.  One of the Fed chief's comments that markets latched on to was her view that the U.S. central bank would not need to raise rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the  neutral  funds rate. Equities were also underpinned by a drop in bond yields as Yellen sounded cautious on inflation. Debt markets jitters prompted last month by an outbreak of harmony among top central banks about tightening policy appear to have evaporated again. Indeed, markets doubt even that modest Fed tightening will ensue and imply only a 50-50 chance of a interest rate rise by December. Treasuries rallied in reaction, with yields on two-year notes falling to three-week lows, as did bonds in Europe and Asia. Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield was back below 0.5 percent, having now given back a quarter of the rise triggered by last month's hint from Mario Draghi that the European Central Bank was preparing to scale back stimulus. Treasuries meanwhile have clawed back a third of their selloff.  The market did perceive a greater degree of anxiety over inflation -- at the margin,  said Westpac's U.S. economist, Elliot Clarke.  To our mind, this is unlikely to get in the way of another hike this year.   Two further hikes in 2018 will likely be justified by conditions. However, the case for additional hikes thereafter is nowhere near being made.  Oh Canada The odd one out was Canada, where yields hit their highest since late 2013 after the Bank of Canada raised rates a quarter point saying the economy no longer needed as much stimulus. The Canadian dollar notched its biggest percentage gain since March 2016 and was last trading near one-year peaks at C$1.2726. The Aussie and Kiwi dollars jetted higher too. The main loser was the U.S. dollar which slipped as far as 112.86 on the yen, while the euro went all the way up to $1.1480 before dropping back in European trading to $1.14. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was within a whisker of nine-month lows at 95.75 although it was clawing back some of its lost ground ahead of U.S. trading. The drop in U.S. yields benefited gold, which pays no interest, and pushed the precious metal up 0.3 percent to $1,223.16 and away from its recent trough of $1,204.45. Oil prices flatlined as producer club OPEC said it expected demand to decline next year as rivals pump more, though the Chinese trade data showed it remained a heavy buyer. Brent crude futures were off 20 cents at $47.52 a barrel, while U.S. crude eased 17 cents to $45.31. Asia's share market gains had also lifted Indian stocks to an all-time high. South Korea and Australia's main indexes both climbed 1.1 percent too, the former helped as its central bank kept interest rates at a record low. Japan's Nikkei had been restrained by a firmer yen and ended flat, though emerging market stocks stood tall as they climbed to a new 26-month high on the Fed's soothing signals.  Dollar positioning is short and yesterday's testimony just confirmed what the market believed: that the Fed is not going to be able to be as hawkish as they are suggesting,  said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 FX strategy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London.

The associations, based in Europe, the United States, Japan and South Korea and representing around 70 percent of global car production, also called for the quotas to be postponed by at least one to three years, the magazine said on Thursday.  China last month upheld the sales quotas for electric cars in draft regulation, ignoring concessions that had been agreed between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The draft says that automakers must sell enough electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles to generate  credits  equivalent to 8 percent of sales by 2018, 10 percent by 2019 and 12 percent by 2020 -- criteria many in the industry deem too ambitious. The number of credits per car is based on the level of electrification. According to WirtschaftsWoche, the industry associations are demanding that the Chinese government includes less harsh penalties for failing to reach the sales quota, and that it tailors the quota to each carmaker's production volume to avoid putting companies that make a smaller number of vehicles at a disadvantage.

The associations, based in Europe, the United States, Japan and South Korea and representing around 70 percent of global car production, also called for the quotas to be postponed by at least one to three years, the magazine said on Thursday.  China last month upheld the sales quotas for electric cars in draft regulation, ignoring concessions that had been agreed between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The draft says that automakers must sell enough electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles to generate  credits  equivalent to 8 percent of sales by 2018, 10 percent by 2019 and 12 percent by 2020 -- criteria many in the industry deem too ambitious. The number of credits per car is based on the level of electrification. According to WirtschaftsWoche, the industry associations are demanding that the Chinese government includes less harsh penalties for failing to reach the sales quota, and that it tailors the quota to each carmaker's production volume to avoid putting companies that make a smaller number of vehicles at a disadvantage.

In a re-run of a recent duel over helicopter training, Italy's Leonardo and Europe's Airbus are both preparing to enter the race to replace a mixture of private and military training for UK forces from 2020, the sources said. Leonardo is considering an offer to supply its Aermacchi M-346 trainer for the competition known as 'Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT)' together with an unidentified British contractor. Airbus, which recently won a major UK military helicopter training contract, defeating a bid from Cobham that included AgustaWestland aircraft from Leonardo, is considering bidding for the contract as part of a group-wide services drive. Toulouse-based Airbus, which already provides training for the German air force with modified Bombardier Learjets through its GFD unit, declined to comment. A Leonardo spokesman said it would  evaluate a range of options  based on UK requirements that are in the early stages of being defined, and was in discussion with potential partners. Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) is looking for a single company or consortium to fulfill the prestige contract to train its military pilots with methods including aggressor training, or simulating 'bad guys' in mock battles. Those services are currently carried out by Cobham using target-towing business jets and Hawk T1 trainers from a naval air squadron managed by UK outsourcing company Serco. FILE PHOTO - Leonardo logo is seen during celebrations for the 500th Eurofighter Typhoon produced by the European consortium at Caselle airport in Turin, Italy, April 11, 2017.Stefano Rellandini The MoD is pretty agnostic about platforms, but it is the training capability that is important to them,  said Alexandra Ashbourne-Walmsley, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a UK-based think tank. Securing local partners could be valuable for foreign bidders as they adjust to realities after Brexit, she said.  You are going to see more of that emphasis on UK defense and jobs across the defense procurement process.   Leonardo and Airbus would join a growing field of competitors, highlighted by plans by several bidders to display  planes at the July 14-16 Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) at RAF Fairford, England, the world's largest military air show. They include Quebec-based Discovery Air Defence Services, which provides combat training for the Canadian air force and has teamed up to bid with UK military services provider Inzpire. UK engineering firm Qinetiq and French defense contractor Thales have picked the new Scorpion jet trainer being developed by Textron Airland for a bid. And at last year's RIAT event, Canadian air training company CAE agreed to bid jointly with Florida-based Draken International, which says it owns the world's largest fleet of tactical ex-military jets including Western and Soviet types. A decision on the ASDOT contract, worth up to 1.2 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) over 15 years, is expected next year with services due to start in 2020, according to industry reports.

The group, whose credit rating was cut to junk by Standard & Poor's in March 2016, is under pressure to show it can revive profits in France while conditions in Brazil, its second biggest market, have been tough after a deep recession. Chief Financial Officer Antoine Giscard d'Estaing told analysts that group operating profit should rise 20 percent in the first half alone, after Casino reported second-quarter group sales of 9.277 billion euros ($10.6 billion). That was above analysts' average forecast of 9.173 billion euros in a company-compiled consensus and helped by further signs of recovery in Brazil, where sales jumped nearly 10 percent. The company reports first-half earnings on July 27.  We are well in line with our full year objectives and we will improve our profitability in France as expected,  Giscard d'Estaing said, as shares in Casino rose 4 percent to 54.45 euros. Excluding acquisitions, currency effects and revenue on fuel, sales rose 3.3 percent against 3.1 percent growth in the first quarter. French rival Carrefour also reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter sales last week while flagging a persistently challenging environment in France where price cuts helped its hypermarkets division return to growth. Casino, which has been criticised by U.S. activist fund Muddy Waters for being too short term and too leveraged, said it still aimed to grow operating profit at its food retail operations in France by 15 percent this year. It reiterated its prediction for growth of at least 10 percent in group operating profit at current exchange rates, having achieved a 3.7 percent rise in 2016.  This performance clearly underpins profit guidance, where the risk increasingly looks to the upside,  said JP Morgan Cazenove analysts in a note, keeping an  overweight  rating. In France, Casino has cut prices at Geant hypermarkets and reduced retail space for non-food items in response to competition from online and smaller convenience stores, while it has also increased its focus on organic and fresh food products. Giscard d'Estaing said Casino considered the price positioning of all its store banners in France as  solid , compared to its main rivals. Same-store sales at the Geant hypermarkets in France rose 0.4 percent in the quarter, driven by a 4 percent increase in food sales. This compared with a 1.9 percent sales decline in the first quarter of 2017. Monoprix sales alone rose 3.6 percent in the quarter, helped by a new loyalty card, robust textile sales and a rise in delivery services proposed to store clients. Casino, which controls Brazil's top retailer Grupo Pao de Acucar, said food retail sales in Brazil rose 9.9 percent from 9.8 percent in the first quarter, despite slowing inflation, reflecting a recovery at the Extra hypermarkets and strong growth at the Assai stores. $1 = 0.8739 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/casino-results-idUSL8N1K40XD"},

The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS SCBAM's National IMQR is driven by its robust investment process, exceptional investment resources and multi-layered risk controls. The rating also reflects the asset manager's sound investment performance, strong investment-management franchise and systematic communication with mutual, private and provident fund investors. SCBAM has consistently implemented its medium-term objective of gravitating to multi-strategy asset-allocation funds while consolidating its leading market position in the private-fund segment. Its investment offerings demonstrate depth and breadth, with high product sophistication relative to industry peers. SCBAM's 'Excellent(tha)' rating is based on the following category scores: Investment process: Strong Investment resources: Excellent Risk management: Excellent Investment performance: Consistent Company and client servicing: Excellent National IMQRs are assigned on a descriptive scale based on Fitch's assessment of the asset manager's investment capabilities and the strength of its operational platform. Asset managers are rated 'Excellent', 'Strong', 'Proficient', 'Adequate' and 'Weak', relative to the standards applied by institutional investors in the relevant national market. Asset managers in the 'Excellent' national scale category demonstrate an operational framework that Fitch considers superior relative to domestic institutional standards. Investment Process SCBAM's investment process is deemed robust relative to the industry. This is driven by the asset manger's documented portfolio reviews, in-depth research and disciplined buy-and-sell process that is overseen by an investment committee. There is now greater stability in the firm's equity investment process after several years of refinement. Investment Resources SCBAM's investment resources exhibit an exceptional degree of industry experience, functional segregation, limited key-man dependence and well-balanced portfolio manager profiles. Staffing numbers and experience are consistent with the firm's coverage, backed by clear portfolio-management responsibilities and a variety of data sources. The asset manager's investment teams are extremely well-organised and have high levels of collective and individual investment-management experience. Past senior-level turnover has been accompanied by timely replacements. Its front and middle- to back-office systems are highly automated and integrated, with evidence of top-notch functionality, scalability and regular maintenance. Risk Management SCBAM's risk controls are multi-layered, evident in its integrated system controls, experienced risk managers and rigorous control processes, including frequent stress tests, counterparty reviews and regular reporting of operational, market, liquidity and credit risks. Investment risk management is strongly embedded in the asset manager's investment processes and risk analytics. SCBAM's parent, The Siam Commercial Bank Public Company Limited (AA+(tha)/Stable), governs risk policy, participates in SCBAM's risk management committee and provides its subsidiary with a robust set of risk-related resources. Investment Performance The firm's three-year risk-adjusted fund performance has mostly been sound relative to peers. SCBAM has mostly outperformed the industry average in fixed-income funds - the largest contributor to its assets under management (AUM) - on a risk-adjusted basis for each fund classification. The asset manager has also outperformed peers in equity funds focusing on small and mid-cap stocks, but has lagged peers in larger-stock funds that tend to be constrained by legacy investment guidelines. Company and Client Servicing Established in 1992, SCBAM has a sound investment-management franchise and significant footprints across a range of fund types, with THB1.3 trillion of AUM at end-April 2017. It retains a strong presence in fixed-income funds, which accounted for 76% of total AUM. The firm covers a broad range of mutual funds and has rapidly expanded its offerings in multi-strategy asset-allocation funds. Already the largest in the market, SCBAM's private funds have also seen notable increases in AUM in recent years, accounting for about 45% of total market share in April 2017. This attests to SCBAM's strong franchise among institutional and high-net worth clients. The firm's communication to unitholders has been systematic, often exceeding regulatory and industry standards. This is evident in its detailed reports to unitholders. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating is sensitive to adverse changes to any of the following five key pillars: investment process; investment resources; risk management; investment performance; and the company's performance, including client servicing. Any negative change in the score assigned to one or more pillars could lower the rating.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The impact of the first day of Yellen's Congressional testimony, which markets took as a signal the U.S. central bank may go softer with monetary policy tightening than it has previously insisted, was fading on the U.S. dollar in morning trade in Europe. But share prices were broadly higher across Europe and Asia, driving more gains for commodity-linked currencies like the Aussie and kiwi seen as most closely connected to appetite for risk on financial markets and rising asset prices.  The focus is shifting to these more risky trades,  said John Hardy, head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank in London.  Yellen proved more dovish on the margin than expected. That gave the green light to carry trades... and emerging markets and commodities have performed strongly. That may be the focus for the next 10 days, maybe longer.  Against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength, the U.S. dollar fell back to its lowest since last October in Asian trading, undoing all of a recovery last week driven by generally higher global bond yields. But it steadied in the European morning, trading flat against the basket at 95.727 and 0.1 percent higher against the euro at $1.1402. The kiwi and Aussie dollars rode out a poor set of New Zealand data to stand respectively 1.1 percent and 0.8 percent higher on the day, leading gains for the G10 group of developed world currencies along with the Swedish crown. Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 FX strategy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London, said that while the dollar looked broadly weaker, there was substantial resistance to any gains past $1.15 for the euro. A number of major banks say investors have also not bought heavily into the yen's gains against the dollar over the past fortnight, making it riskier for them to jump on the rally now.  Dollar/yen has been appreciating but investors do not have the trade,  he said.  Overall positioning on emerging markets is still long. On G10 it is very light. People are going to try and pick the central banks which will be going faster on rate rises in the future.  The U.S. currency has been falling steadily since hitting a 14-year high at the start of this year and a number of major banks who had previously backed it to gain further have called its longer-term rally as over. But against that is the continuing contrast in interest rates - and the outlook for them - in the United States and Europe and Japan. U.S. 10-year interest rates are 4 times - or almost 2 full percentage points - higher than those in Germany.  Our data suggests that U.S. inflation is actually picking up again,  said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.  The Fed appears to still be in a position to continue hiking rates.

Before the financial crisis, the flow of  petrodollars  was one of the most powerful forces driving the U.S. bond market and the dollar, as oil exporters invested their booming trade surpluses into Treasuries. But that flow isn't what it once was, and may be about to dry up further. The Fed's $1.7 trillion bond-buying stimulus has crowded out demand from oil exporters and their once huge trade surpluses have shrunk thanks to sluggish oil prices. Far from having plenty of fresh cash to invest abroad, these countries are shoring up finances and safeguarding stability at home. It is hard to accurately measure oil producing countries' holdings of Treasuries, but on the face of it, their share of the U.S. bond market is smaller today than it was before the global financial crisis that started a decade ago. In 2007, 12 oil exporters across the Middle East and Africa held 3.2 percent of outstanding U.S. Treasuries, excluding the Fed's own holdings, according to Reuters calculations. Last year that share was 2.5 percent. Interestingly, the 75 percent collapse in the oil price between mid-2014 and early 2016 appears to have had little impact on their holdings of U.S. Treasuries. Not yet anyway. The same 12 countries held 2.4 percent of outstanding U.S. Treasuries excluding Fed holdings in mid-2014, when oil was $115 a barrel and about to begin its slide all the way down to a new multi-year low of $27. These countries continue to add to their Treasuries holdings. In 2007 their collective stash was $118 billion, and last year it was over $500 billion. But oil's collapse from a record high of $148 a barrel in mid-2008 coupled with the Fed's QE blitz has diminished petrodollars' sway over Treasuries. From Surplus to Deficit The whereabouts of oil-producing countries' international investments is notoriously difficult to pinpoint because so little information is publicly disclosed. Even the size of their holdings can be opaque. In 2007 the International Monetary Fund estimated that United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth funds could be anything between $250 billion and $875 billion. It is assumed that a chunk of petrodollars are reinvested overseas through offshore financial centres such as Britain (London), Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Switzerland and The Cayman Islands. Of the $17.13 trillion pile of U.S. securities last year from stocks to bonds, these centres held $6.56 trillion, meaning nearly 40 percent of all U.S. financial securities are in six relatively small -- or tiny, frankly -- hands. Some of that will almost certainly be diversified into riskier assets like stocks and corporate bonds, which offer higher returns than the sovereign bond yields crushed since the crisis by central bank asset purchases. By some measures the petrodollar was at the peak of its global powers in 2006. Oil and energy exporters recycled some $500 billion into global bank lending markets and financial markets that year, according to BNP Paribas. Current account surpluses from 2000 to 2014 were poured into overseas markets via sovereign wealth funds to give these countries a non-oil income and profit stream. The purchase of U.S. bonds was also a function of them keeping their currencies pegged to the dollar. These boom years have left a deep pool of resources to draw from in the current leaner times. Middle Eastern and African sovereign wealth funds now control over $3 trillion of assets, double the $1.6 trillion or so pre-crisis in 2007. But with oil below $60 a barrel for the last two years -- below $50 for most of that time -- their finances are under pressure. In the short term, as has happened with Qatar recently, currency pegs may come under attack. In the long-term, domestic social and economic pressures will see foreign exchange reserves reduced, not increased. OPEC countries ran a collective current account deficit in 2015 for the first time since 1998. Saudi Arabia's deficit last year was 8.7 percent of GDP compared to a surplus of nearly 30 percent in 2005. When the Fed starts its gradual withdrawal from the Treasuries market, Saudi Arabia and other oil exporters are less likely to fill the gap than they would have been only a few years ago.

In a re-run of a recent duel over helicopter training, Italy's Leonardo and Europe's Airbus are both preparing to enter the race to replace a mixture of private and military training for UK forces from 2020, the sources said. Leonardo is considering an offer to supply its Aermacchi M-346 trainer for the competition known as 'Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT)' together with an unidentified British contractor. Airbus, which recently won a major UK military helicopter training contract, defeating a bid from Cobham that included AgustaWestland aircraft from Leonardo, is considering bidding for the contract as part of a group-wide services drive. Toulouse-based Airbus, which already provides training for the German air force with modified Bombardier Learjets through its GFD unit, declined to comment. A Leonardo spokesman said it would  evaluate a range of options  based on UK requirements that are in the early stages of being defined, and was in discussion with potential partners. Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) is looking for a single company or consortium to fulfill the prestige contract to train its military pilots with methods including aggressor training, or simulating 'bad guys' in mock battles. Those services are currently carried out by Cobham using target-towing business jets and Hawk T1 trainers from a naval air squadron managed by UK outsourcing company Serco. FILE PHOTO - Leonardo logo is seen during celebrations for the 500th Eurofighter Typhoon produced by the European consortium at Caselle airport in Turin, Italy, April 11, 2017.Stefano Rellandini The MoD is pretty agnostic about platforms, but it is the training capability that is important to them,  said Alexandra Ashbourne-Walmsley, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a UK-based think tank. Securing local partners could be valuable for foreign bidders as they adjust to realities after Brexit, she said.  You are going to see more of that emphasis on UK defense and jobs across the defense procurement process.   Leonardo and Airbus would join a growing field of competitors, highlighted by plans by several bidders to display  planes at the July 14-16 Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) at RAF Fairford, England, the world's largest military air show. They include Quebec-based Discovery Air Defence Services, which provides combat training for the Canadian air force and has teamed up to bid with UK military services provider Inzpire. UK engineering firm Qinetiq and French defense contractor Thales have picked the new Scorpion jet trainer being developed by Textron Airland for a bid. And at last year's RIAT event, Canadian air training company CAE agreed to bid jointly with Florida-based Draken International, which says it owns the world's largest fleet of tactical ex-military jets including Western and Soviet types. A decision on the ASDOT contract, worth up to 1.2 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) over 15 years, is expected next year with services due to start in 2020, according to industry reports.

The Office for Budget Responsibility said ensuring robust trade agreements was more significant for the long-run health of Britain's public finances than the size of any 'divorce bill' to settle one-off liabilities with the EU.  While some numbers mooted for it are very large, a one-off hit of this sort would not pose a big threat to fiscal sustainability. More important are the implications of whatever agreements are reached with the EU ... for the long-term growth of the UK economy,  the OBR said. Just a 0.1 percentage-point fall in the annual growth rate of the economy and tax revenues would cause Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio to be 50 percentage points higher after 50 years, if public spending plans remained unchanged, the public body added. A continuation of Britain's recent weak productivity would also make tax rises or spending cuts more likely, the OBR said. Finance minister Philip Hammond said the report was  a stark reminder of why we must deliver on our commitment to deal with our country's debts .

The assertion by the official in President Moon Jae-in's government was a reversal of the contention by the previous government that most of the cash that flowed into the jointly run Kaesong project was diverted to North Korea's military. South Korea suspended the operations at the industrial park, just on the North Korean side of their common border, where South Korean factories employed North Korean workers, last year after the North launched a rocket that put an object into orbit. At the time, South Korea said it would no longer allow the funds paid at Kaesong to be used in the North's missile and nuclear programs.  The previous government said repeatedly that Kaesong wages were diverted by the North but I can say the government does not have any basis for this,  the senior government official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. The liberal Moon came to power in May winning a snap election called after the removal of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, whose conservative government implemented a hardline policy against the North.  Park was forced from power this year over a corruption scandal and is now on trial. Moon was elected in May on a plan to engage in talks with North Korea. He had pledged to reopen joint commercial projects with the North, including Kaesong, but has modified that position by saying there must first be progress on suspending North Korea's nuclear program.  About 120 South Korean companies paid about double the $70 a month minimum wage in North Korea for each of the 55,000 workers  hired in Kaesong. The project resulted from the first inter-Korean summit meeting in 2000, when leaders of the two Koreas pledged reconciliation and cooperation.  But by last year, it was the last remaining symbol of that effort amid deteriorating cross-border ties. Park's conservative government said 70 percent of the U.S. dollars paid as wages and fees at Kaesong was channeled to the North's ruling party. It said various sources had confirmed the flow of money but it did not specify who they were.

He did not expect the opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) to unite with two other dissident groupings, the  Moscow  and  Cairo  platforms, in time for direct talks with Syria's government during this round.  But asked if it could happen before the next round of Geneva negotiations, slated for late August, de Mistura told reporters:  Perhaps even earlier.   I'm not pushing for it. Because I want, when it happens, that there should not be a row but should be real talks. We are actually pushing for areas where they do have common points.  The Moscow and Cairo platforms each comprise a handful of activists and are named after the cities where they first convened, at meetings held with Russia's approval and support. They do not control territory on the ground or have strong links with armed groups engaged in the war.   De Mistura was speaking before a meeting with Syrian government negotiator Bashar al-Ja'afari, promising to  go into much more substance on the political side .  The glacial pace of the Geneva talks, which some observers see as simply a way of keeping an avenue for peace talks open in case of an unexpected breakthrough, owes much to the fact that de Mistura has to meet each delegation separately. Some diplomats suspect the Moscow and Cairo platforms, which are much less opposed to President Bashar al-Assad than the HNC is, are little more than a mechanism created by Assad's ally Russia to prevent direct negotiations and force the HNC to dilute its stance.   It’s always been a trap for the opposition laid by the Russians, through their continual needling of the HNC about there being more than one opposition, which is mostly nonsense with the relative weight of these groups,  a Western diplomat said.  If the HNC succeed in defusing this trap, and coming together with the Moscow and Cairo groups in some way, then it puts Ja’afari under quite a lot of pressure.   Another Western diplomat said it was a  Russian narrative  that the various groups needed to unite.   I feel this is a lever the Russians will keep to destabilize the opposition, they want to have a handle to weaken the opposition, therefore to have a handle on the process as such.      To us, the broader the opposition the better, but at the same time the most important thing is to have an opposition that is cohesive, can act as one party in the political process.  The three opposition groupings have recently held technical talks, aligning their positions to the extent that they might be able to field a single delegation, if not a united one.   We're coming together on substance, not just principles but operationally,  HNC negotiator Basma Kodmani told Reuters.  We're building an alternative to Assad.

The groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and Earthjustice, argued the agency's June 6 announcement that it would wait to identify areas of the country where smog pollution is especially heavy until it gathered more information and reviewed existing pollution standards was illegal. At issue in the lawsuit is a provision in the Clean Air Act that requires the EPA to decide what levels of smog pollution are acceptable, then identify parts of the country where pollution exceeds those levels and enforce their cleanup. The agency released standards and designations in 2008 and 2015, and was due to update them this year.  Simply put, delay of designations delays the stronger pollution controls Congress mandated to protect people in communities with unhealthy air,  said the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Liz Bowman, a spokeswoman for the EPA said the agency had asked lawyers representing the groups in a phone call on Tuesday to delay filing their suit for two weeks. She said the EPA was still working on the designations and its lawyers believed the suit would be unnecessary once the groups saw the results of the agency's work. Bowman said the groups were reading too much into the delay.  The agency was not going to meet the original deadline for all 50 states,  she said.  This administrator doesn't like being outside the bounds of statutory deadlines so he said extend it. We're continuing our work.      The topic has been a recent source of dispute. Environmental groups and representatives of industries that contribute to  smog, like power plants, sparred in court over whether the previous designations were too lax or too strict. Mustafa Ali, a former assistant associate administrator for environmental justice at the EPA, criticized the delay and said the suit, in which he was not involved, was warranted. If the EPA needed more time to deal with certain states over their designations, the agency could do so without the overall delay, he said.  You can always work with states that are not moving  quickly, you can build some accommodation into the process,  he said.   How long do these communities need to wait? What we're really doing is playing with their lives.  Reporting by Emily Flitter; Editing by Tom Brown","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-environment-lawsuit-idUSKBN19X31O"},

The diplomatic spat -- in which a number of Gulf states cut links with Qatar over alleged support for terrorism, which Doha denies -- comes as U.S. and European central banks are already fuelling a rise in global borrowing costs by preparing to unwind years of super-easy credit. Any petrodollar repatriation by Gulf states in a deeper crisis could exacerbate financial strains. The concern stems from long-standing Gulf currency pegs. Qatar has already battled to steady the riyal's fixed exchange rate to the dollar; investors now fear a prolonged crisis could spread to pegs in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman. Gulf governments are adamant they will hold the pegs and with collective sovereign assets approaching $3 trillion in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates they have the resources to do so.  But much of that buffer is held overseas. From Italian banks to Silicon Valley start-ups, U.S. Treasury bonds and London skyscrapers, there is barely a mainstream asset class untouched by Gulf money. At the height of the oil boom around 2006, net  recycling  of oil-fueled surpluses into world markets was estimated at over $500 billion a year, most of it from the Gulf.  The (Gulf) stand-off could last years,  said Abhishek Kumar, lead investment manager for emerging market debt at State Street Global Advisors.   They own prime properties around the world as well as undisclosed amounts of liquid assets -- bonds and equities -- so if they need to sell, the impact is going to be felt.  Such concerns arose in 2014, when plunging oil prices caused the first net withdrawal of petrodollars from markets in 18 years, according to a BNP Paribas report at the time. Gulf countries have easily fended off past episodes of peg pressure such as during the 2009 Dubai crisis and in early-2016 when oil prices hit $27 a barrel. And so far, pressure has been confined to Qatar.  Qatari banks, whose $50 billion external liabilities dwarf central bank reserves, may need more aid if the crisis deepens.  FILE PHOTO: A gas flame is seen in the desert near the Khurais oilfield, Saudi Arabia June 23, 2008.Ali Jarekji/File PhotoBut the Qatar row is just one hurdle for regional governments. They face a bleak oil price outlook, as well as a firmer dollar and U.S. rate rises which, though the pegs, are stymying their bid for economic diversification.   The (Gulf) pegs are going to be challenged,  said Michael Cirami, head of emerging debt at Eaton Vance.  Does it matter? It should matter if you have investments in the region.  Hurdles The biggest problem for Gulf watchers is pinpointing the true extent and location of the overseas wealth, with high-profile holdings such as Qatar's Volkswagen stake or Saudi investments into Uber just the tip of the iceberg. What is known from U.S. government data is that Gulf states own some $240 billion of Treasuries. Saudi Arabia is believed to hold the lion's share of its central bank assets in dollar deposits, with Treasuries amounting to $126 billion. How easily could Gulf states can swap overseas assets for hard cash if needed? Some is embedded in companies. But Fitch estimates just 10-20 percent of assets are illiquid, even in Qatar which has a big property portfolio. The 2014 BNP Paribas report calculated that over a tenth of the petrodollars recycled the previous year went into stocks and bonds, while 20 percent made their way to direct equity stakes. Of the remainder, at least half went to bank deposits and thereafter into loan markets, the note said.  One should expect Gulf governments to sell liquid assets when they have to. I am sure the Qataris will be moving some of their less liquid assets into more liquid ones as a form of insurance, i.e. real estate into equities,  said Marcus Chenevix, a Middle East economist at consultancy TS Lombard. Gulf holdings in European firms, meanwhile, may be four times bigger than previously thought because these investments are often made via external asset managers, according to a study by Nasdaq Corporate Solutions. The Gulf crisis impact may be diluted by two factors, though. First, the global pension and insurance industry's $70 trillion asset base continues to grow, offsetting putative Gulf sales. Second, low debt levels should allow Gulf states to borrow, rather than sell the family silver.  The external sovereign debt of six Gulf states has already  quintupled from 2009 levels to around $150 billion, Fitch data shows and they will likely tap bond markets regularly in future.  If they had not issued bonds and accumulated liquidity I think we would have seen more pressure. They have been using the proceeds of these bonds to bridge the gap,  Salman Ahmed, chief global strategist at Lombard Odier said.

In a letter to the lawmakers, the groups said many climate programs  are likely to undermine military readiness by diverting scarce resources.  The programs in question were initiated by former President Barack Obama's 2015 executive order requiring the military to meet green energy and greenhouse gas emissions targets. The conservative groups are trying to gather support for Republican Representative Warren Davidson's amendment to the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act that would stop the military from implementing the policies. The groups include the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group; Americans for Prosperity, a group funded by the conservative Koch brothers; and Americans for Limited Government. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has long been supportive of programs that reduce troops' petroleum dependence. In written testimony to a Senate panel after his confirmation hearing in January, Mattis said  climate change can be a driver of instability  and is  a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of-government response.  The House bill includes language from Democratic Representative Jim Langevin that would require the Pentagon to report to Congress on military bases that are most vulnerable from rising seas and other effects of climate change. It is uncertain whether Davidson's or Langevin's measures would be in the final House bill. The House is due to vote this week on its version of the defense bill and the Senate version will follow later this year.      Myron Ebell, the head of global warming and international environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who also led President Donald Trump's transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency, said in an interview that the Defense Department  needs to concentrate on its core mission and not waste a lot of time with irrelevant distractions that gain them some political cover.   When asked about Mattis' position on climate, Ebell said he had heard generals say for years that climate change is a risk and  I've never listened to one who seemed to have the slightest clue as to what he was talking about.  The Defense Department, the largest U.S. consumer of energy, is planning to forge ahead with a decade-long effort to convert operations to green energy.

That won’t be the last battle the U.S. search engine faces over how it arranges its profits. Giant technology companies will always have an advantage over local tax authorities, though. Unlike competing European countries, they can put their global interest first. French authorities had argued that Google should pay up for corporate and value-added tax on activity that involved French customers, but was routed through its Irish subsidiary. That is, by now, a familiar story. Google, Amazon, Apple - as well as lower-tech groups like Starbucks - commonly take advantage of differences between national tax rates to locate parts of their business in a way that minimises the overall bill. In some cases, that’s beneficial for countries with big export sectors – which can charge taxes based on where products are developed and produced, rather than on where they are sold. The battle is characterised by small wins and losses. Google paid 130 million pounds ($168 million) to UK authorities in 2016, and 306 million euros to Italy this May. But often, such decisions come down to a matter of nuance. A big company might argue, as Google has, that its UK business merely offers marketing services to an Irish-based sales company, which means that profit from actual sales is rightly taxed in Ireland. In some cases, it might be possible to argue that certain staff members in Britain were effectively engaging in sales. Even then, though, the principle that tax is payable where profit is booked – not where the customer is based – is still intact. Governments remain at a disadvantage because big businesses like Google, Facebook and Amazon can think globally. Sacrificing a dollar in Ireland to save two in France makes perfect sense for them – and is what shareholders expect. The European Union, a collection of 28 member states, soon to be reduced to 27, finds that kind of thinking difficult. The idea that countries should retain full sovereignty over their tax rates has proven impossible to prise away. So long as that remains true, those that can put the bigger picture first will have the upper hand.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The assertion by the official in President Moon Jae-in's government was a reversal of the contention by the previous government that most of the cash that flowed into the jointly run Kaesong project was diverted to North Korea's military. South Korea suspended the operations at the industrial park, just on the North Korean side of their common border, where South Korean factories employed North Korean workers, last year after the North launched a rocket that put an object into orbit. At the time, South Korea said it would no longer allow the funds paid at Kaesong to be used in the North's missile and nuclear programs.  The previous government said repeatedly that Kaesong wages were diverted by the North but I can say the government does not have any basis for this,  the senior government official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. The liberal Moon came to power in May winning a snap election called after the removal of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, whose conservative government implemented a hardline policy against the North.  Park was forced from power this year over a corruption scandal and is now on trial. Moon was elected in May on a plan to engage in talks with North Korea. He had pledged to reopen joint commercial projects with the North, including Kaesong, but has modified that position by saying there must first be progress on suspending North Korea's nuclear program.  About 120 South Korean companies paid about double the $70 a month minimum wage in North Korea for each of the 55,000 workers  hired in Kaesong. The project resulted from the first inter-Korean summit meeting in 2000, when leaders of the two Koreas pledged reconciliation and cooperation.  But by last year, it was the last remaining symbol of that effort amid deteriorating cross-border ties. Park's conservative government said 70 percent of the U.S. dollars paid as wages and fees at Kaesong was channeled to the North's ruling party. It said various sources had confirmed the flow of money but it did not specify who they were.

The push for easier terms, a major concern among Japanese utilities after the Fukushima nuclear disaster six years ago led to a surge in LNG imports and drove prices higher, got a boost when the country's anti-trust regulator last month ruled restrictions in supply contracts were anti-competitive.   We have re-negotiations under way, including price review,  said Takashi Higo, senior general manager at the gas resources department of Tokyo Gas.  There will be tough negotiations (with suppliers) and it will take a lot of time,  he added, speaking to reporters at an energy conference. The decision by Japan's Fair Trade Commission to rule that so-called destination clauses that restrict resale of LNG cargoes are anti-competitive is likely to lead to more trading by buyers in Japan and could prompt challenges to similar restrictions elsewhere in Asia.

An advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously to recommend approval of Novartis AG's (NOVN.S) tisagenlecleucel for treating B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and young adults who relapsed or failed chemotherapy. The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisers but typically does so. Austin Schuetz, who lives in Wisconsin, was treated in 2013 with the Novartis therapy as part of a clinical trial after leukemia cells were detected in his brain just two months after a bone marrow transplant from an anonymous donor.   We knew it was risky ... but it was the only option for us,  said Kim Schuetz, Austin's mother. She said Austin, then age 6, suffered fever and severe headaches after the engineered T-cells were administered, but today shows no signs of cancer. The new drug class, known as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell or CAR-T, involves a complicated process of extracting immune system T-cells from an individual patient, altering the cell DNA to sharpen their ability to spot and kill cancer cells, and infusing them back into the patient.  The majority of calls we are getting are from patients looking for immunotherapies - particularly CAR-T therapies,  said Dr. Gwen Nichols, chief medical officer at the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.  Novartis has lagged some other big drugmakers in the first wave of immunotherapy drugs that are revolutionizing cancer treatment. Companies including Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) are logging billions of dollars in annual sales of drugs known as  checkpoint inhibitors  that fight cancer by removing a brake on the body's immune system.  The word is out there that this is different from traditional chemotherapy,  Dr. Nichols said.   Between 80 percent and 90 percent of children with ALL are cured with intense chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant, but there are few options for remaining patients.  If your child is in that 10 to 20 percent, you are desperate,  Dr. Nichols said, while cautioning that it is too early to tell whether CAR-Ts offer lasting remissions for patients. In a clinical trial, 79 percent of patients given the Novartis therapy were alive a year later. Patients with ALL who fail chemotherapy typically have only a 16 percent to 30 percent chance of survival.  CAR-Ts can also pose serious risks, including a potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition. Austin Schuetz, one of a handful of CAR-T patients to achieve multi-year remission of his cancer, requires biweekly infusions of immunoglobulin to replace B-cells wiped out by the engineered cancer-killing T-cells. Without B-cells, his body would not be able to fight off common infections. If approved by the FDA, CAR-T therapies could cost up to $500,000 and generate billions of dollars for their developers.  As the cost of cancer drugs increases, health insurers have placed tighter restrictions on patient access.  While CAR-T is a promising new type of immunotherapy, it is not commercially available and we have yet to complete our evaluation,  T.J. Crawford, a spokesman for health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) said in a statement. About 6,000 people are diagnosed with ALL in the United States each year and about 60 percent are children, according to the American Cancer Society.  The FDA's decision on the Novartis drug, expected by late September, has significant implications not only for the Switzerland-based drugmaker but for companies making similar drugs, including Kite Pharma Inc (KITE.O), Juno Therapeutics Inc (JUNO.O) and Bluebird bio Inc (BLUE.O). The agency is expected to decide by Nov. 29 whether to approve Kite's CAR-T, axi-cel, for treatment of adults with advanced and aggressive lymphoma. Kite has also reported data showing remission in 73 percent of 11 patients with relapsed ALL treated with axi-cel. It plans to launch a Phase 2 trial in the fourth quarter. Juno scrapped its initial CAR-T candidate for ALL after five patient deaths.

The breakout follows one by five lions in May, raising alarm bells in South Africa, which contains its big, dangerous wildlife in fenced reserves to prevent conflict with rural communities and livestock.   The lion population has grown exponentially and is a contributing factor to young males looking to new territories,  South African National Parks (SANParks) said in a statement.  This is as a result of naturally occurring factors like drought which we have seen in the last two years, allowing for an abundance of animals for predators like lions to feed on, and an increase in their population,  it said. South Africa was scorched by a drought in 2015/16, which hit crop production and caused many of the water holes in Kruger to dry up, providing predators with a bonanza in dead and dying prey species. An abundance of young males would create lethal conflict in the park as coalitions of older males would drive them away, leading them to take escape routes through gaps in Kruger's fencing. South Africa launches large operations to return or eliminate alpha animals when escapes occur. Four of the five that escaped in May were eventually recaptured. The current batch of felines on the run is believed to be in a rugged, mountainous and thickly wooded area south of the park, making capture efforts difficult but also providing relief as the cats are not an immediate threat to humans or livestock.

Determined to capitalise on its global network of 3 million short-term renters to help out in disasters and displacement crises, the online lodgings marketplace is working with city authorities around the world to improve emergency preparation and response, as well as provide free housing for refugees. Kellie Bentz, Airbnb’s head of global disaster response and relief, told a video discussion on Wednesday that the company has to adapt what it can offer to the context of each disaster. With Grenfell, that meant not offering temporary accommodation to families whose homes were destroyed in the fire. “Moving survivors from one place to the next, to the next is the last thing you want to do when they’ve just lost everything and they have been through this very traumatic event,” Bentz told the webinar hosted by Zilient, a network for resilience practitioners. “Where we landed was helping... the Red Cross come in, and supporting them through our Airbnb accommodation.” Airbnb is one of a growing number of businesses looking to bolster the ability of cities to cope with manmade disasters such as the Grenfell Tower fire, as well as natural hazards like earthquakes, floods and storms. Partnering with the private sector from the outset when finding ways to make cities better prepared to tackle shocks and longer-term stresses is crucial, said Michael Berkowitz, president of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, backed by The Rockefeller Foundation. “In every disaster, the private sector is massively and inextricably involved,” said Berkowitz. “The question is: Are they involved in a joined-up way with government and civil society authorities?” “The private sector has so much more to add by way of expertise, and technical know-how and facilities and resource.” Welcome Mat San Francisco-based Airbnb, which first enabled its hosts to lodge relief workers and evacuees when Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, is now working with emergency management authorities to ensure its members have plans in place ahead of disasters. It also runs online training programmes with aid agencies like the Red Cross, and its network of more than 100 sharing clubs offers a forum for hosts to meet local disaster experts. With listings in over 65,000 cities, Airbnb can also be a “megaphone” for disseminating information from the emergency services and a direct connection to people visiting an area when a disaster strikes, said Bentz. “It’s just a matter of education, information - and cities... realising they can’t do it on their own,” she said. Airbnb, which last month launched a platform enabling hosts to offer space to refugees and evacuees, has set a goal to provide free short-term accommodation for 100,000 people over five years, and is working with refugee support programmes in countries such as Canada, France and Italy. In the United States, it aims to supply short-term “gap” housing for refugees when they first arrive in the country, while in Paris, authorities are looking to the company to help lodge refugees for up to six months, said Bentz. Those needing a place to stay are matched up with hosts via approved aid agencies, including the International Rescue Committee – and these organisations are requesting housing for periods of several months, said Bentz. Most Airbnb hosts might only be able to donate a few nights here and there, she noted. But others are willing to provide longer-term accommodation that helps displaced people become established in new places – and Airbnb can contribute the mechanism to match supply and demand, said Bentz. “What we believe is there is actually this other marketplace out there of hosts that just want to host for good, that just want to host for causes,” she said.

The diplomatic spat -- in which a number of Gulf states cut links with Qatar over alleged support for terrorism, which Doha denies -- comes as U.S. and European central banks are already fuelling a rise in global borrowing costs by preparing to unwind years of super-easy credit. Any petrodollar repatriation by Gulf states in a deeper crisis could exacerbate financial strains. The concern stems from long-standing Gulf currency pegs. Qatar has already battled to steady the riyal's fixed exchange rate to the dollar; investors now fear a prolonged crisis could spread to pegs in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman. Gulf governments are adamant they will hold the pegs and with collective sovereign assets approaching $3 trillion in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates they have the resources to do so.  But much of that buffer is held overseas. From Italian banks to Silicon Valley start-ups, U.S. Treasury bonds and London skyscrapers, there is barely a mainstream asset class untouched by Gulf money. At the height of the oil boom around 2006, net  recycling  of oil-fueled surpluses into world markets was estimated at over $500 billion a year, most of it from the Gulf.  The (Gulf) stand-off could last years,  said Abhishek Kumar, lead investment manager for emerging market debt at State Street Global Advisors.   They own prime properties around the world as well as undisclosed amounts of liquid assets -- bonds and equities -- so if they need to sell, the impact is going to be felt.  Such concerns arose in 2014, when plunging oil prices caused the first net withdrawal of petrodollars from markets in 18 years, according to a BNP Paribas report at the time. Gulf countries have easily fended off past episodes of peg pressure such as during the 2009 Dubai crisis and in early-2016 when oil prices hit $27 a barrel. And so far, pressure has been confined to Qatar.  Qatari banks, whose $50 billion external liabilities dwarf central bank reserves, may need more aid if the crisis deepens.  FILE PHOTO: A gas flame is seen in the desert near the Khurais oilfield, Saudi Arabia June 23, 2008.Ali Jarekji/File PhotoBut the Qatar row is just one hurdle for regional governments. They face a bleak oil price outlook, as well as a firmer dollar and U.S. rate rises which, though the pegs, are stymying their bid for economic diversification.   The (Gulf) pegs are going to be challenged,  said Michael Cirami, head of emerging debt at Eaton Vance.  Does it matter? It should matter if you have investments in the region.  Hurdles The biggest problem for Gulf watchers is pinpointing the true extent and location of the overseas wealth, with high-profile holdings such as Qatar's Volkswagen stake or Saudi investments into Uber just the tip of the iceberg. What is known from U.S. government data is that Gulf states own some $240 billion of Treasuries. Saudi Arabia is believed to hold the lion's share of its central bank assets in dollar deposits, with Treasuries amounting to $126 billion. How easily could Gulf states can swap overseas assets for hard cash if needed? Some is embedded in companies. But Fitch estimates just 10-20 percent of assets are illiquid, even in Qatar which has a big property portfolio. The 2014 BNP Paribas report calculated that over a tenth of the petrodollars recycled the previous year went into stocks and bonds, while 20 percent made their way to direct equity stakes. Of the remainder, at least half went to bank deposits and thereafter into loan markets, the note said.  One should expect Gulf governments to sell liquid assets when they have to. I am sure the Qataris will be moving some of their less liquid assets into more liquid ones as a form of insurance, i.e. real estate into equities,  said Marcus Chenevix, a Middle East economist at consultancy TS Lombard. Gulf holdings in European firms, meanwhile, may be four times bigger than previously thought because these investments are often made via external asset managers, according to a study by Nasdaq Corporate Solutions. The Gulf crisis impact may be diluted by two factors, though. First, the global pension and insurance industry's $70 trillion asset base continues to grow, offsetting putative Gulf sales. Second, low debt levels should allow Gulf states to borrow, rather than sell the family silver.  The external sovereign debt of six Gulf states has already  quintupled from 2009 levels to around $150 billion, Fitch data shows and they will likely tap bond markets regularly in future.  If they had not issued bonds and accumulated liquidity I think we would have seen more pressure. They have been using the proceeds of these bonds to bridge the gap,  Salman Ahmed, chief global strategist at Lombard Odier said.

Bangladesh's deal with Qatar, the worlds' biggest LNG exporter, will be its first and will feed its import terminal starting up in 2018 that is designed to cover the country's domestic gas shortfall. The country's turn to the spot market highlights the trend of gas buyers seeking more flexibility in their purchases rather that being locked in to multi-year contracts. Under the still pending deal, Bangladesh will buy less than the 4 million tonnes per year (tpy) of LNG that it agreed to in a 2011 memorandum of understanding with Qatar's state-owned RasGas, said Kazi Mohammad Anwarul Azim, manager of state-owned energy company Petrobangla’s LNG Cell, who declined to provide a specific volume as the deal is still under negotiation. Petrobangla is likely to ink a deal for around 2.5 million tpy of LNG starting from early 2018, a separate Bangladesh official said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to discuss commercial matters. RasGas declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The first floating storage and regasification unit that will start up in April 2018 can handle 3.75 million tpy of imports and the country will turn to spot purchases the market up the difference.  We will go for both long-term and spot deals to import LNG to ensure smooth supplies and competitive prices,  Azim said. Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Co, part of Petrobangla, last month posted a notice on its website looking to shortlist potential LNG suppliers for spot cargoes starting in 2018. Asian LNG prices have dropped 73 percent from their peak in 2014 to $5.45 per million British thermal units because of rising production from Australian and the United States. LNG-AS  It is likely that Bangladesh wanted to look at the spot market, given the coming supply glut, to meet some of its demand requirements,  said FGE analyst Poorna Rajendran.  We expect Asian spot LNG prices to remain weak, significantly below long-term contract prices.  Bangladesh's domestic gas output is about 2.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) against demand of 3.3 bcfd, according to Petrobangla. That has left it unable to fuel its power plants and industry.

Shares in Europe's third-largest budget airline behind Ryanair and EasyJet dropped as much as 11 percent to their lowest since October 2014, taking this year's losses to 34 percent. Norwegian Air's strategy of taking on more established flag carriers comes with a number of risks such as buying or leasing larger, more expensive planes, and its plan has been hit by rising costs in recent months. The airline said its second-quarter adjusted operating profit before leasing and depreciation (EBITDAR) dropped 21 percent to 1.19 billion crowns ($144 million), well below the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 1.51 billion crowns.  Light years behind expectations,  Swedbank analyst Hans Ludvigsen, who has a  Neutral  rating on the stock, wrote in a note to clients. Norwegian Air also said it now expected available seat kilometres (ASK), a measure of capacity growth, to increase by 25 percent in 2017, down from a previous estimate of 30 percent. At the same time, it raised its forecast for unit costs (CASK) to 0.42 crowns from a range of 0.39-0.40 previously.  We saw a clear risk for the guidance on both CASK and ASK to change, and both happened. But we did not expect the magnitude,  said Ludvigsen. Higher Costs Norwegian Air, whose chief financial officer abruptly resigned after 15 years in the job last week, said the lower second-quarter results were due to significant additional costs for leasing aircraft.  A larger share of leased aircraft in the fleet, and a larger share of 787 aircraft, lead to increased unit costs,  the company said, referring to its acquisition of more Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Norwegian Air's operating expenses jumped 45 percent, driven by a 56 percent increase in technical maintenance costs, which it put down to changes in its fleet, rising engine service costs and a fall in the Norwegian crown against the U.S. dollar. Despite the cost problems, Norwegian Air said securing financing for new planes due to be delivered in 2018 would not be a problem.  Anyone who believes we can't pay for the aircraft will be disappointed,  Chief Executive Officer Bjoern Kjos told an earnings presentation. The airline also said a new passenger tax levied on all commercial flights departing from Norwegian airports from June 2016 was another factor that had affected its earnings.  The climate for European Airlines is this year probably the worst since the financial crisis. Brexit and terrorism in Europe plus passenger fees in Norway are making it difficult for all airlines,  said Karl-Johan Molnes, an analyst at Norne Securities, which has a  Sell  rating on the stock.  However, the situation is particularly bad for Norwegian Air Shuttle because its unit costs numbers are also getting hit with increasing costs as pilot costs are rising at a time when it needs 25 pilots for each new Dreamliner,  Molnes said.

Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics, was murdered in 2015 as he walked across a bridge near the Kremlin after dining with his girlfriend. Aged 55, he had been working on a report examining Russia's role in the conflict in Ukraine. His killing sent a chill through opposition circles. Slideshow (6 Images)The same court last month found the five men guilty of killing Nemtsov, but the late politician's allies said the investigation had been a cover-up and that the people who had ordered his killing remained at large. The court handed the longest sentence, of 20 years, to Zaur Dadayev, a former soldier in Chechnya and the man state prosecutors said pulled the trigger.  The other four Chechen men convicted of being his accomplices received jail sentences ranging from 11 to 19 years.  The shortcoming of this sentencing is that those who ordered and organized this crime are not in the dock,  said Vadim Prokhorov, a lawyer for Nemtsov's daughter Zhanna. State prosecutors said the group had followed Nemtsov around the Russian capital and had been promised a bounty of 15 million rubles ($249,169.44) between them for the high-profile assassination. Shamsudin Tsakayev, Dadayev's lawyer, told Reuters after the sentencing that there was  incontrovertible proof  that his client had not committed the crime.

Even other patients at the First Hospital of China Medical University in the northeastern city of Shenyang, where Liu is being treated, seem not to know they are sharing the facilities with a world famous dissident. When Reuters visited the floor where friends say Liu is being treated, visitors for other patients on the same ward seemed confused and asked why there were new procedures when security questioned them and checked their IDs. Nothing has appeared in Chinese-language official media since Liu was diagnosed with cancer in late May. Searches for  Liu Xiaobo  on Chinese social media show no results. China's foreign ministry answers questions from international media at its daily briefing with the standard line: China is a country ruled by law and the case is an internal affair; other countries should not meddle.  Asked on Thursday why questions and answers on Liu were missing from the foreign ministry website, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: “If you can decide how to write [your reports], then I think as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we can decide what goes online or not.”  The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid published by the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, is the only publication that regularly writes articles about Liu, in English, and usually to rebuff international criticism.     The paper has cast Liu as an outsider marginalized from society whose cause has failed inside China.  It was “overseas dissidents  who are the most active in  hyping the issue” and are trying to “boost their image by ‘deifying’ Liu,” the Global Times said in a Monday editorial. “Western mainstream society is much less enthusiastic than before in interfering with China's sovereign affairs,” it said. Charter 08 Liu was the co-author of a pro-democracy manifesto called Charter 08, which attracted more than 10,000 signatures online before the authorities deleted the document from internet pages and chatrooms. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, a year after he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion.  Charter '08, issued in 2008, reflected an apparent shift in China at the time toward becoming more open to liberal ideals, said Beijing-based historian and political commentator Zhang Lifan. That changed when Xi Jinping came to power in 2013.  Since (Liu) was sentenced, peaceful transformation as a route for change has essentially been blocked off by the party. Since the new administration came into office, the party is moving in the opposite direction,  he said. Hu Jia, a well-known Beijing-based dissident and friend of Liu's, says few people in China know anything about him or his work. Pro-democracy activists continue their sit-in demanding the release of Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 12, 2017.Bobby Yip The reality is that if you are on the streets of Beijing and you stop a hundred people, to have one know who Liu Xiaobo is would be a great result,  he said.  Chinese society, due to internet censorship and being cut off from the rest of the world, essentially does not get to hear our (dissident) voices. Protesting voices on Weibo are almost not existent these days,  Hu said. But Xi has helped the dissident movement by locking up a peaceful protester and letting him die in detention.  The last state to do that was Nazi Germany,  Hu says.  Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist who died in 1938 in Nazi Germany's Berlin, was the last Nobel Peace Prize winner to live out his dying days under state surveillance. 'Need to Act' Slideshow (2 Images)While China's censorship makes it difficult to assess Liu's support, he is a  hero  for many liberals in China, even if few will speak out for him, a Chinese editor at an online publication said, declining to be named.  I am really not sure if it's accurate to claim he is unknown to the public, (or if) people are just too scared to show their knowledge (of Liu),  the editor said. Despite the restrictions, internet posters have written in support of Liu and his cause, using variations on his name to avoid the censors.  When it comes to freedom, comes to constitutional government, we have talked too much, now we need to act,  read one comment on the micro-blogging platform Weibo.  Situations like Liu Xiaobo's are still a worry, but we nevertheless need people to act, bravely face the risk of death and act.    The post echoed something Liu wrote in April 1989 when he  returned from studying in the United States to take part in the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square: intellectuals often  just talk , they  do not do .  He's leaving, but we cannot see, cannot speak, cannot act  said the headline of an article shared as an image on the popular messaging platform, WeChat, a method that can slow down the censors. In the article, three people born in the 1980s were interviewed about Liu.  I will see him as a very important symbol, (but) people like him fail to get attention from common folk, and given his plight as an unknown prisoner of conscience, there is little to say,  one person identified as L said in the article. Albert Ho, who heads the Hong Kong Alliance organizing protests in Liu's support, said China's efforts to erase Liu from people's memory will fail.      Don't underestimate the power of the internet ... And don't underestimate the people. I have seen many episodes where suddenly the hero gets degraded into the devil and the devil becomes the hero,  he said, referring to previous shifts in China's political system.  People are not living in an open society in China so you never know,  he said.

Overseas operating profit at its main Uniqlo division, which is known for its lightweight down jackets and HeatTech fabric technology and accounts for around four-fifths of Fast Retailing's revenue, soared 50.7 percent in the quarter. The result underscored Uniqlo's growing presence in Asia, which makes up 80 percent of its foreign sales. With stores located in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Southeast Asia,  some of these countries are more profitable than even Japan , Chief Financial Officer Takeshi Okazaki told reporters at an earnings briefing on Thursday. Fifty Uniqlo stores opened abroad in the third quarter. With the closure of 8 stores, that brought the total number to 1,071 - more than triple the number the retailer had just five years ago. By contrast, Fast Retailing's operating profit in Japan fell 18 percent, pulled down by a weaker yen that impacted costs of goods, and rising logistics and wage costs. Overall, it reported a profit of 49.9 billion yen ($441.67 million) for the three months through May. That compared with a 52.85 billion yen Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate, based on estimates of six analysts. The retailer stuck with its 175 billion yen forecast for the year ending August, versus the 182 billion yen SmartEstimate of 15 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weight to recent estimates by the more consistently accurate analysts. Fast Retailing, founded by Tadashi Yanai, one of Japan's richest men, is overhauling its supply chain as it looks to reduce inventory losses and boost its e-commerce offering, which lags behind peers. The company, which has said it aims to eventually overtake Zara-owner Inditex to become the world's biggest apparel retailer, has constructed a combined logistics centre and office space in Tokyo which brings together staff from departments including marketing and e-commerce.  The domestic apparel industry is facing tough times and cannot expect growing sales,  Okazaki said.  E-commerce will be our growth driver,  he said, adding that while Uniqlo was good at bringing customers to its physical locations, the company had to do more to drive traffic to its online site. In the last quarter e-commerce accounted for 6.2 percent of total sales. Fast Retailing's results cap a quarter that saw many Japanese retailers maintaining positive full-year outlooks, while some firms spoke of higher costs as they reported quarterly operating profit declines. Sales at furniture retailer Nitori Holdings Co Ltd rose while operating profit in the quarter through May fell 5.6 percent as the company accelerated store expansion plans. Two of Japan's biggest convenience store operators also saw higher costs affecting earnings, with FamilyMart UNY Holdings Co Ltd weighed down by consolidation costs and Lawson Inc reporting an operating profit decline due to financial support for franchise owners hit by higher wage pressures.

The Boeing 777 (BA.N) was shot down over eastern Ukrainian  territory held by pro-Russia separatists fighting Ukrainian government forces, by a Russian-made Buk missile, the Dutch Safety Board concluded in an October 2015 report. All 298 people on board, most of them Dutch, were killed. The Netherlands foreign ministry announced last week that any suspects identified in bringing down the aircraft will be tried in a Dutch court and under Dutch law. [nL8N1JW1EE]  Hopefully end of the year or early next year, we can get a decision on who we can actually charge in court,  Liow told reporters at an MH17 memorial service in Putrajaya, Malaysia's administrative capital on Thursday. About 90 family members of 43 Malaysians killed in the crash attended the service, where they were briefed on the latest developments in the investigation. A Dutch-led team of investigators from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, and Ukraine, concluded in September that the rocket was fired from territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists.      That finding contradicts Russia's suggestion that the aircraft was brought down by Ukraine's military, not the separatists.  Authorities urged the people responsible for launching the Buk missile to come forward, Liow said, adding that the investigators' conclusions were sound.  We are confident that we will be able to identify the criminals responsible and that we will be able to bring them to court,  he said.  Md Salim Sarmo, 68, whose son was on board MH17, said he had been waiting for justice.  We were told that it's just a matter of time before they can be brought to justice ... this is a decision that we've been waiting for,  he said.

Eight decades after one of Russia's darkest chapters, it is his reputation, not Stalin's, that is on trial.    The historian, 61, is being tried on charges brought by state prosecutors of involving his 11-year-old adopted daughter in child pornography, illegally possessing  the main elements of  a firearm, and of depravity involving a minor.  If convicted of the charges, which he denies, he faces up to 15 years in jail. Fellow historians, rights activists and some of Russia's leading cultural figures say Dmitriev has been framed because his focus on Stalin's crimes has become politically untenable under President Vladimir Putin.  They say his real crime is dedicating himself to documenting Stalin's 1937-38 Great Terror, in which nearly 700,000 people were executed, according to conservative official estimates. His arrest followed close on the heels of the release by Memorial, the organization for which he works, of a list of more than 40,000 Stalin-era secret policemen, a move that raised an outcry among some of their descendants.   With a national election due in March that Putin is expected to contest and win, anything that jars with a Kremlin narrative that Russia must not be ashamed of its past is unwelcome. Reuters was unable to independently determine if the case against Dmitriev was related to his work. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the government did not play any role.  It's not like that,  Peskov told Reuters.  The Kremlin is not involved in such cases.    Historians, relatives and rights activists are not convinced. Show trials were common in Stalin's era. History, they say, is repeating itself.  It's unfortunately not a one-off case,  said prominent historian Nikolai Svanidze, who sits on an official body that relays human rights concerns to Putin.  The authorities are taking a hard look at historians. They regard history, or our past, as an ideological selection process. Honest historians are seen as political opponents.  Blogger Vladimir Luzgin found that out last year after reposting an article on social media which said Stalin's Soviet Union had conspired with Nazi Germany to invade Poland in 1939. A court found him guilty of knowingly distributing false information and fined him 200,000 roubles ($3,368.43).  Luzgin could not be reached for comment.  The Case The case against Dmitriev centers on whether or not naked photos he took of his daughter from 2008 to 2015 are pornographic, as state investigators allege. The girl was adopted at age three after a drawn-out court battle with social services because Dmitriev, an adoptee himself, was deemed to be too old. He and his second wife separated soon afterwards. Dmitriev's lawyer, Viktor Anufriev, said his client, who is used to meticulously photographing evidence in his professional life, took the pictures twice a year to document her physical condition in case of further problems with social services. He became particularly worried after carers at the girl's nursery school expressed concern about marks on her skin that turned out to be residue from a medical dressing, Anufriev told Reuters.     The daughter has not made a complaint, he said. Dmitriev could not be reached for comment in jail in north-west Russia, where he has sat since his arrest in December. Anufriev expects a verdict in the case, which started on June 1, on Sept. 1. One of Dmitriev's two children from his first marriage, Yekaterina Klodt, told a Moscow news conference in June the allegations were  absurd  and likened the trial to a circus.   FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a placard reading,  Freedom for Yuri Dmitriev  during a protest in support of political prisoners in central St. Petersburg, Russia, February 6, 2017. Interpress/Roman Pimenov viaFile PhotoShe and her children spent a great deal of time with Dmitriev and his adopted daughter and considered themselves  one family,  Klodt said. Dmitriev was a wonderful father to her as well as to his adopted daughter, who was now distraught to have been separated from him, she said. She linked his prosecution to his work, including the discovery of the mass graves.  Not everyone liked what he did,  she said. The Investigative Committee of Karelia, whose investigators submitted the case for prosecution, did not respond to Reuters' questions about whether there was a political side to the trial, saying only that there was enough evidence to open a criminal case. The committee declined to elaborate on its evidence. Mass Grave at Sandarmokh Putin has called Stalin  a complex figure .   Excessive demonisation of Stalin is one of the ways to attack the Soviet Union and Russia, to show that today's Russia bears some kind of birthmark from Stalinism,  he told U.S. filmmaker Oliver Stone in June.  He also noted that  the horrors  of Stalin's rule should not be forgotten. But some historians fret that the annexation of Crimea, which Kremlin-backed TV cast as a righteous replay of World War Two, has emboldened Stalin's admirers. Monuments and memorial plaques to Stalin are springing up in different Russian regions. State-approved textbooks have softened his image, and an opinion poll in June crowned him the country's most outstanding historical figure.     As head of the local branch of Memorial, which documents Russia's Soviet past, Dmitriev was part of a team that found a mass grave at Sandarmokh in the north-west in 1997.  More than 9,000 people, many of them members of the Soviet intelligentsia, were executed at the site. Many had been imprisoned in the Gulag labor camps and forced to build one of Stalin's showcase projects, the White Sea-Baltic Canal. Dmitriev made it his mission to find other graves, pieced together victims' identities and published tens of thousands of names.  He is also the organizer of an annual international commemoration of victims that attracts diplomats from countries like Ukraine, which are critical of Putin. After Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014, Kiev boycotted the event. The release of the 40,000 names in November caused a new furor. Though Dmitriev was not involved in compiling the list, he started getting anonymous calls afterwards asking if he had similar information he planned to release, Anufriev said. He was arrested on Dec. 13 by police acting on an anonymous tip, the lawyer said. Three days earlier, someone had broken into his home just as he was answering a summons to appear at a local police station to explain why he owned a hunting rifle.  His computer was accessed and 144 images of his daughter copied or printed off, Anufriev said.      An expert group called by state prosecutors told the court it believed nine of the images were pornographic. A medical expert called by the defense, Lev Shcheglov, disagreed with their assessment. In a video posted to social media, he also questioned the group's qualifications because it was made up of an art historian, a maths teacher and a pediatrician. Three of the nine images leaked to state TV were broadcast with the girl's face, breasts and pubic area blurred. They show her standing straight and alone, with bookshelves in the background. Her arms are raised in one and by her side in the other two.            Is this pornographic material? No,  Shcheglov said, and described the prosecution's case as  madness and absurdity . As for the guns charge, Anufriev said that Dmitriev owns parts of a sawn-off shotgun, but it is an old hunting rifle that doesn't fire, and no bullets have been found.

Emmy-winning  Game of Thrones  debuted the first episode of the seventh season at a lavish premiere in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, which was lit up with projections of dragons, fire and ice for the occasion.  The new season sees the show's lead characters with nothing left to lose after they sacrificed families, children, innocence, dignity and even their lives, in the case of the resurrected Jon Snow.  The stakes are high as they head towards a great war that will determine who will sit on the Iron Throne and rule over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, while the zombie army of White Walkers advances towards them, threatening mankind's destruction.  The theme of revenge is set early in the new episode, titled  Dragonstone,  as one character warns  if one wolf survives, the sheep are never safe.     Guests were asked not to reveal any more details of the plot until the episode's Sunday debut on HBO, though spoilers have already started to appear online.  Cast member Kit Harington poses at a premiere for season 7 of the television series  Game of Thrones  in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 12, 2017.Mario AnzuoniActress Sophie Turner said her character Sansa Stark, who evolved from a young captive into a stoical leader, has to grapple with  new-found power.   She has no idea how to kind of absorb that and take on that role because she's never worked like that,  Turner told Reuters TV on the red carpet. Slideshow (5 Images) Game of Thrones,  based on George R.R. Martin's  A Song of Ice and Fire  books, follows the epic story of a multi-generational struggle for control of the Iron Throne. It is the most-watched show on cable network HBO, averaging around 25 million viewers last season, which saw the women of Westeros rise up and seize power.   It left Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) sitting on the Iron Throne in King's Landing, her brother Jamie at her side, both struggling with the deaths of their children.  Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) was last seen sailing towards King's Landing with Tyrion Lannister, her army and dragons to reclaim her ancestral home. Arya (Maisie Williams) had just killed the man who murdered her family, while Sansa sat alongside Jon Snow as rulers of the North. The saga will conclude with its eighth season next year, and a series of spin-offs is being developed.

The U.S.-Singaporean firm, which makes gaming keyboards and mice, is eyeing a valuation of up to $5 billion in a listing later this year, Reuters reported on Wednesday citing a source. While the broader industry in which this company operates is hot, the financial reality of Razer is underwhelming. Razer’s motto is  For Gamers. By Gamers. . It boasts a loyal customer base of hardcore players - a niche that is expected to spend $3.3 billion globally on peripherals by 2020, according to the company’s prospectus. Razer already dominates the market for gaming mice in China and Europe, these are emblazoned with the trademark logo of a neon green three-headed snake bearing names like DeathAdder and Lancehead. Existing investors include chipmaker Intel and Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing.  The excitement ends there. Annual sales from its peripherals business grew at a tepid 5.7 percent last year. And while top-line growth for Razer's gaming laptops looks promising, gross margins there stood at a dismal 2.9 percent. Boss Min-Liang Tan, who enjoys a cult-like status, is also investing heavily in research and marketing. Excluding share-based compensation and other onetime charges, adjusted losses stood at $20.3 million at the end of December – more than triple the level of a year earlier.  Tan's expansion drive is also cause for caution. Razer is preparing to launch a mobile device and has started selling credits – via a digital currency called  zGold  - which players can use to purchase items in online games. Razer will be taking its chance against handset makers like Apple and Samsung, plus the likes of Nintendo and Sony. Meanwhile, the business of virtual currencies is still evolving. Rival peripherals-maker Logitech trades at just over three times last year's sales, Eikon shows. Applying the same multiple to Razer's core peripherals unit, which accounts for more than three quarters of revenue and almost all of its gross profit, will value that business at $902 million. Finding value for the rest of the company will require the same stretch of imagination as a fantasy role-playing game.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The Boeing 777 (BA.N) was shot down over eastern Ukrainian  territory held by pro-Russia separatists fighting Ukrainian government forces, by a Russian-made Buk missile, the Dutch Safety Board concluded in an October 2015 report. All 298 people on board, most of them Dutch, were killed. The Netherlands foreign ministry announced last week that any suspects identified in bringing down the aircraft will be tried in a Dutch court and under Dutch law. [nL8N1JW1EE]  Hopefully end of the year or early next year, we can get a decision on who we can actually charge in court,  Liow told reporters at an MH17 memorial service in Putrajaya, Malaysia's administrative capital on Thursday. About 90 family members of 43 Malaysians killed in the crash attended the service, where they were briefed on the latest developments in the investigation. A Dutch-led team of investigators from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, and Ukraine, concluded in September that the rocket was fired from territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists.      That finding contradicts Russia's suggestion that the aircraft was brought down by Ukraine's military, not the separatists.  Authorities urged the people responsible for launching the Buk missile to come forward, Liow said, adding that the investigators' conclusions were sound.  We are confident that we will be able to identify the criminals responsible and that we will be able to bring them to court,  he said.  Md Salim Sarmo, 68, whose son was on board MH17, said he had been waiting for justice.  We were told that it's just a matter of time before they can be brought to justice ... this is a decision that we've been waiting for,  he said.

The magazine said the images, which show the truck ploughing through a crowd watching fireworks on the seafront Promenade des Anglais, were taken from city's CCTV surveillance system. Other pictures show the bloodied body of the 31-year-old Tunisian attacker in the cab of his hire truck, a selfie the Islamic State loyalist took on the afternoon of the attack on the promenade, and other taken at the same site over the previous 12 months. The Paris prosecutor urged a court to take an emergency decision to halt sales of the latest edition, a judicial source told Reuters. Those pictures  are an insult to the victims' dignity,  said Eric Morain, a lawyer for several victims' associations. They  create a morbid and voyeuristic atmosphere that has nothing to do with freedom of information,  he added, asking judicial authorities to get the magazine off the newsstands. Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi said the images were  unbearable and despicable.  In an online statement, Paris Match defended the images saying they were meant to inform the public and ensure the victims were not forgotten. A decision will be taken at around 2 pm (1200 GMT), the judicial source said. Several media had been criticised last year for showing graphic images of victims. President Emmanuel Macron will be in Nice on Friday for a ceremony to honour the attack victims. The government has come under fire for the way it deals with helping the victims of the attack.

With his reputation as a skillful strategist hanging in the balance, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will present the revised bill in a bid to unite disparate Republican factions and deliver on his party's signature issue in the 2016 elections. He is aiming for a vote next week. A Wednesday closed-door meeting did not resolve several disputes among moderate and conservative Republicans over the bill's contents, senators said. But President Donald Trump, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, said he would be  very angry  if he does not get a bill on his desk to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. John Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, told Reuters in a Capitol hallway many senators had come to realize they could talk about healthcare  endlessly  without deciding anything.  That's why it's important that we go ahead and schedule the vote,  he said. The House of Representatives passed a healthcare overhaul bill last month. In the interview on Wednesday, the Republican president said McConnell  has to pull it off  in the Senate. Several of the Senate's 52 Republicans said they were waiting to see the revised legislation before deciding whether to back it. This made it difficult to predict whether it can gather the minimum of 50 votes it will need to pass the 100-vote chamber, with Vice President Mike Pence ready to cast a tie-breaking vote for the bill. Democrats are united in opposition to the effort to scrap Obamacare. Conservative Republican Senator Rand Paul made clear he was against the bill and would not even vote to advance it procedurally. He said it would be  worse  than a previous draft because it is expected to leave in place some of the Obamacare taxes on wealthy Americans. Cornyn said one unresolved issue was whether to include a proposal by conservative Republican Ted Cruz that would let insurers offer basic low-cost healthcare plans that do not comply with Obamacare regulations. Some moderates dislike this, saying it could leave insurers charging more for comprehensive plans that do comply with Obamacare. Insurers weighed in strongly against the idea on Wednesday as well. The previous draft of the bill unveiled last month would phase out the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal many of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on individuals who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. Moderate Republican senators are uneasy about the millions of people forecast to lose their medical insurance under the legislation and hard-line conservatives say it leaves too much of Obamacare intact.

An advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously to recommend approval of Novartis AG's (NOVN.S) tisagenlecleucel for treating B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and young adults who relapsed or failed chemotherapy. The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisers but typically does so. Austin Schuetz, who lives in Wisconsin, was treated in 2013 with the Novartis therapy as part of a clinical trial after leukemia cells were detected in his brain just two months after a bone marrow transplant from an anonymous donor.   We knew it was risky ... but it was the only option for us,  said Kim Schuetz, Austin's mother. She said Austin, then age 6, suffered fever and severe headaches after the engineered T-cells were administered, but today shows no signs of cancer. The new drug class, known as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell or CAR-T, involves a complicated process of extracting immune system T-cells from an individual patient, altering the cell DNA to sharpen their ability to spot and kill cancer cells, and infusing them back into the patient.  The majority of calls we are getting are from patients looking for immunotherapies - particularly CAR-T therapies,  said Dr. Gwen Nichols, chief medical officer at the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.  Novartis has lagged some other big drugmakers in the first wave of immunotherapy drugs that are revolutionizing cancer treatment. Companies including Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) are logging billions of dollars in annual sales of drugs known as  checkpoint inhibitors  that fight cancer by removing a brake on the body's immune system.  The word is out there that this is different from traditional chemotherapy,  Dr. Nichols said.   Between 80 percent and 90 percent of children with ALL are cured with intense chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant, but there are few options for remaining patients.  If your child is in that 10 to 20 percent, you are desperate,  Dr. Nichols said, while cautioning that it is too early to tell whether CAR-Ts offer lasting remissions for patients. In a clinical trial, 79 percent of patients given the Novartis therapy were alive a year later. Patients with ALL who fail chemotherapy typically have only a 16 percent to 30 percent chance of survival.  CAR-Ts can also pose serious risks, including a potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition. Austin Schuetz, one of a handful of CAR-T patients to achieve multi-year remission of his cancer, requires biweekly infusions of immunoglobulin to replace B-cells wiped out by the engineered cancer-killing T-cells. Without B-cells, his body would not be able to fight off common infections. If approved by the FDA, CAR-T therapies could cost up to $500,000 and generate billions of dollars for their developers.  As the cost of cancer drugs increases, health insurers have placed tighter restrictions on patient access.  While CAR-T is a promising new type of immunotherapy, it is not commercially available and we have yet to complete our evaluation,  T.J. Crawford, a spokesman for health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) said in a statement. About 6,000 people are diagnosed with ALL in the United States each year and about 60 percent are children, according to the American Cancer Society.  The FDA's decision on the Novartis drug, expected by late September, has significant implications not only for the Switzerland-based drugmaker but for companies making similar drugs, including Kite Pharma Inc (KITE.O), Juno Therapeutics Inc (JUNO.O) and Bluebird bio Inc (BLUE.O). The agency is expected to decide by Nov. 29 whether to approve Kite's CAR-T, axi-cel, for treatment of adults with advanced and aggressive lymphoma. Kite has also reported data showing remission in 73 percent of 11 patients with relapsed ALL treated with axi-cel. It plans to launch a Phase 2 trial in the fourth quarter. Juno scrapped its initial CAR-T candidate for ALL after five patient deaths. The company has since reported early trial results for a different CAR-T showing that 66 percent of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients responded to the drug, and 18 percent suffered severe neurological side effects.

KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating action follows the decision of the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) to suspend AMANAT's license for compulsory lines of business for three months effective 5 July 2017. The rating reflects AMANAT's weak capitalisation, improved financial performance and the weak, albeit improving, credit quality of its investments. AMANAT's license suspension followed a supervisory inspection from NBK in 1Q17. The company's license was suspended for compulsory business due to a number of violations, including failure to implement recovery measures and inaccuracies in solvency margin calculations. The company has agreed a number of remedial actions with the regulator, including the injection of additional capital by the shareholder. Fitch believes that this license suspension is significant for AMANAT's credit profile given its focus on motor lines, in particular compulsory motor third-party liability (MTPL) which made up 14% of the company's gross written premiums in 2016. AMANAT's reported regulatory solvency margin was 109% at end-2016, a slight improvement from 101% at end-2015. The company has little cushion in terms of the regulatory solvency margin and is at risk of non-compliance over time. Fitch views significant strengthening of the regulatory solvency position as unlikely in the short term. Based on Fitch's Prism factor-based model AMANAT's risk-adjusted capitalisation was below 'somewhat weak' based on 2016 results, slightly lower than the 2015 result. Target capital increased due to a modest growth in net business volumes while dividend payments reduced available capital. AMANAT reported a lower net income of KZT154 million in 2016 compared with KZT705 million in 2015. Unlike in 2015, the financial result was adversely impacted by the revaluation effect of foreign currency-denominated investments. To a lesser extent, it was supported by stronger investment returns of KZT317 million, with investment yield growing to 10.7% in 2016. In 5M17 the company reported a net income of KZT253 million underpinned by further robust investment income and positive underwriting results. The company reported continued improvement of the combined ratio to 103% in 2016 from 118% in 2015 (2014: 137%), with the administrative expense ratio shrinking significantly to 44% in 2016 from 60% in 2014. The company is focused on reducing administrative expenses via staff optimisation and increased IT automation. AMANAT's reduced loss ratio of 38% (2015: 50%) was another driver of the improved underwriting result in 2016. Bank deposits accounted for 42% of the AMANAT's total investments at end-2016 compared with 52% at end-2015, and stood at 45% at end-5M17. All deposits are held in local banks mainly rated in the 'B' category. Fitch believes there are risks from the weak average credit quality of these instruments, which is mainly attributable to the limited financial standing of the banking system of the Republic of Kazakhstan. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch will resolve the RWN as follows: The ratings are likely to be downgraded if the company's compulsory lines license is not restored, if the shareholder fails to provide the necessary capital support or if significant franchise damage occurs as a result of license suspension. The ratings are likely to be affirmed upon restoration of the licence and injection of funds as required by NBK, provided significant franchise damage has not occurred as a result of the license suspension.

Emmy-winning  Game of Thrones  debuted the first episode of the seventh season at a lavish premiere in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, which was lit up with projections of dragons, fire and ice for the occasion.  The new season sees the show's lead characters with nothing left to lose after they sacrificed families, children, innocence, dignity and even their lives, in the case of the resurrected Jon Snow.  The stakes are high as they head towards a great war that will determine who will sit on the Iron Throne and rule over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, while the zombie army of White Walkers advances towards them, threatening mankind's destruction.  The theme of revenge is set early in the new episode, titled  Dragonstone,  as one character warns  if one wolf survives, the sheep are never safe.     Guests were asked not to reveal any more details of the plot until the episode's Sunday debut on HBO, though spoilers have already started to appear online.  Cast member Kit Harington poses at a premiere for season 7 of the television series  Game of Thrones  in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 12, 2017.Mario AnzuoniActress Sophie Turner said her character Sansa Stark, who evolved from a young captive into a stoical leader, has to grapple with  new-found power.   She has no idea how to kind of absorb that and take on that role because she's never worked like that,  Turner told Reuters TV on the red carpet. Slideshow (5 Images) Game of Thrones,  based on George R.R. Martin's  A Song of Ice and Fire  books, follows the epic story of a multi-generational struggle for control of the Iron Throne. It is the most-watched show on cable network HBO, averaging around 25 million viewers last season, which saw the women of Westeros rise up and seize power.   It left Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) sitting on the Iron Throne in King's Landing, her brother Jamie at her side, both struggling with the deaths of their children.  Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) was last seen sailing towards King's Landing with Tyrion Lannister, her army and dragons to reclaim her ancestral home. Arya (Maisie Williams) had just killed the man who murdered her family, while Sansa sat alongside Jon Snow as rulers of the North. The saga will conclude with its eighth season next year, and a series of spin-offs is being developed.

Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung, citing a search warrant issued by a Stuttgart court, reported that prosecutors were examining the possible use of illegal software to manipulate emissions tests in Mercedes-Benz vehicles between 2008 and 2016.  The Stuttgart prosecutor's office declined to comment on the report. Daimler declined to comment on an ongoing probe of the carmaker by the Stuttgart prosecutor but said it was fully cooperating with the authorities, adding it does not believe cars will lose their road worthiness certification. Analysts said the latest report would spook investors, but stopped short of saying this emissions probe could take on Volkswagen-scale dimensions with millions of vehicles needing to be recalled.  We take comfort from the fact that this is a European issue, not a U.S. investigation. We also do not believe these Merc cars will lose their certification. Our judgment is that Merc will be asked to recall these cars for a 'software fix',  Bernstein Research analysts said in a note on Thursday. If Daimler did face VW-style fines of about $7,000 per vehicle in the United States, the penalty for Mercedes-Benz would be around $200 million to $300 million, Bernstein estimated.  Daimler shares were down 0.8 percent at 0927 GMT, underperforming Germany's blue chip DAX .GDAXI index which was down 0.3 percent. Daimler AG sign is pictured at the IAA truck show in Hanover, Germany, September 22, 2016.Fabian Bimmer/File PhotoIn May, Stuttgart prosecutors, who are working with authorities in the United States, conducted raids of 11 sites in Germany as part of a probe into Daimler and excessive diesel emissions.  The searches were initiated in the course of investigations  against known and unknown employees at Daimler, who are suspected of fraud and misleading advertising connected to manipulated emissions treatment of diesel passenger cars,  the prosecutor's office said at the time.  Two Daimler employees are under investigation by the prosecutor's office. Mercedes-Benz has limited the potential fallout from diesel emissions by dropping plans to seek U.S. approval to sell 2017 Mercedes-Benz U.S. diesel models. The U.S. Justice Department, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and a prosecutor in Stuttgart are investigating emissions of Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. In its quarterly report, Daimler had said that steps taken by U.S. authorities against another manufacturer in January identified software functionalities that are  common in diesel vehicles  as illegal defeat devices.  If these or other inquiries, investigations, legal actions and/or proceedings result in unfavorable findings, an unfavorable outcome or otherwise develop unfavorably, Daimler could be subject to significant monetary penalties, remediation requirements, vehicle recalls, process improvements and mitigation measures,  Daimler said at the time. In January, the EPA and CARB accused Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) of illegally using software to allow excess diesel emissions from 104,000 U.S. trucks and SUVs. Regulators have refused to grant Fiat Chrysler approval to sell 2017 U.S. diesel models.

Airlines may increasingly be forced to cut their loads of passengers, cargo or fuel in order to take off safely because warming air lessens the ability of airplane wings to generate lift, according to U.S. researchers. Worldwide, average temperatures are expected to climb some 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit (3 Celsius) by 2100, researchers said. But it is more prevalent heat waves that pose a larger threat to the airline industry, they said in a study published in the journal Climate Change. Annual maximum daily temperatures at airports could rise by 7 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit (4 to 8 Celsius) by 2080, they found, leading to more costly delays in take-offs or cancellations. During the hottest parts of the day, between 10 and 30 percent of fully loaded planes may have to dump weight in order to begin their journey. The phenomenon could force the aviation industry to brace for thinner profit margins, the authors said. A full 160-seat aircraft trying to safely take off in searing heat may, for instance, need to remove 13 passenger, said the study. But the costs of delays or cancellations could also disrupt other sectors of the economy as they trickle down, they said.  Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost,  said Ethan Coffel, the study's lead author and a researcher at Columbia University in New York City, in a statement. Airports likely to be most affected according to the researchers' appraisal of 19 major airports include New York's LaGuardia, due to short runways, and Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates, because of scorching heat. Projections found the least affected airports included New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, London's Heathrow and Paris' Charles de Gaulle. Last month, major airlines were forced to delay or cancel dozens of flights out of Las Vegas and Phoenix airports, citing difficulty in operating aircraft amid a heat wave. Previous research has found that changes in climate may increase turbulence on flights, the researchers said. They said their study was the first such global analysis.

Due to be formally unveiled later this year, Wallich Residence's penthouse is in the tallest building in Singapore, the island of well-heeled stability that attracts the super-rich from its less-developed Southeast Asian neighbors, as well as multi-millionaires from mainland China. The 'bungalow in the sky' penthouse in the GuocoLand-developed Tanjong Pagar Centre, is likely to become Singapore's most expensive apartment. It will test the endurance of demand for luxury property in the city-state – the part of the market that has taken the biggest hit from measures aimed at cooling down property prices in recent years. Prices for luxury homes in Singapore have fallen 15-20 percent from a 2013 peak, according to JLL consultancy, part of the Jones Lang LaSalle global property services group. But JLL is now starting to see the prospects of a turnaround – at least at the top end of the market – and is forecasting a 3-5 percent increase in luxury prices this year, citing demand from both locals and foreigners who feel the market is bottoming out.  JLL said the volume of transactions in the first four months of the year in Singapore's core central region, which is popular among wealthy foreigners and includes the Orchard Road shopping area and Sentosa island, was 35 percent higher than in the same period last year.  A lot of people think Singapore is value for money because it's been downhill all the way - such a long winter,  said  Chandran VR, managing director at a real estate agency specializing in high-end homes.  Now they feel it is the right time to come in,  he said.  By contrast, he noted that Hong Kong apartment prices have been soaring, adding that  sensible investors will come here,  instead. GuocoLand Singapore Group Managing Director Cheng Hsing Yao said buying by foreigners has picked up since the start of the year at the developer's high-end Leedon Residence project, near the 150-year-old Singapore Botanic Gardens. GuocoLand is part of Malaysian conglomerate Hong Leong Group, headed by billionaire Quek Leng Chan.  In absolute numbers, it may not be that huge, but the ticket sizes are actually quite significant for some of them,  Cheng said. Some foreigners were buying homes worth S$8-12 million in the project, he said.     The recent tightening of property market controls elsewhere, such as in Hong Kong and Australia, has played a part in attracting foreign demand to Singapore's luxury property this year, Cheng said. City Developments Ltd (CDL), one of the largest Singapore developers, also said the average sales price at its high-end Gramercy Park project has risen to more than S$2,800 per square feet in recent months, up 8 percent from a year ago, and foreign buyers accounted for three-quarters of the project so far. A view of Guocoland's Leedon Residences in Singapore June 23, 2017.Edgar SuCDL's billionaire Chairman Kwek Leng Beng is a cousin of the Malaysian developer Quek. Plenty of Tools Still, Singapore's broader residential market remains subdued, having fallen for 15 straight quarters to log its longest losing streak since official records began in 1975.  We are forecasting for prices to come down between 1 to 5 percent this year before reaching an inflection point in 2018,  said Eli Lee, an analyst for OCBC Investment Research.       While prices in Hong Kong tripled and Sydney's doubled over the past decade, Singapore prices rose just 29 percent.     Singapore introduced property price cooling measures to curb speculation as did many other  hot property  cities in the region. While some measures were relaxed slightly this year, the authorities warned last month there would be no more rolling back for now. Singapore is not short of policy tools to ward off speculators.     Most of the island's apartment blocks were built and then managed by the government, though the vast majority of the units have been sold to citizens. This allows it to keep control of some speculative activity, and therefore prices. Initial buyers of government apartments, for example, are largely prevented from flipping a property through a fast resale. The high home ownership rate, at about 90 percent, also makes it easier for policymakers to craft measures targeting speculative demand when the market is overheated.  All home buyers have to pay a stamp duty at a progressive rate of up to 3 percent, but foreigners have to pay an additional 15 percent for their purchases. Singaporeans also have to pay an extra stamp duty of 7-10 percent when they make second and subsequent purchases.  With tightening measures taken in other countries, that could lead investors to shift funds back here. So we just have to watch that very closely,  Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said last month. New home sales more than doubled in March from a year earlier, reaching their highest level in nearly four years.    And developers, led by Chinese companies, are paying record sums to secure land. Shenzhen-based developer Logan Property and its partner Nanshan Group recently paid a record  S$1 billion at a government land auction. That was almost 50 percent more than the previous record set in 1997.  The strong winning bid...signals developers' strong confidence in the Singapore residential market and their belief that prices could return to growth soon,  said Christine Li, research director at Cushman and Wakefield in Singapore.

Comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen late on Wednesday signalled that the Fed's rate hikes, which make Central Europe's debt yields relatively less attractive, could be glacial, at best.     Regional yields have risen in the past three weeks as the latest comments from the European Central Bank cemented expectations that a reversal of its monetary easing could be near.     Czech, Hungarian and Polish 10-year yields dropped by about 2 basis points on Thursday, with the Polish paper trading at 3.3 percent at 0832 GMT, tracking a similar move in Bunds.     Investors in Central Europe closely watched a surge in the Bund yield to 19-month highs, above 0.5 percent in the past weeks. Thursday's regional bond yield drop was only a fraction of the previous rise since late June.     Currencies retreated from Wednesday's peaks, indicating that the Fed comments would not become a game changer.     The forint traded 0.2 percent weaker against the euro at 307.4 at 0839 GMT, off a 4-week high reached on Wednesday.      The ECB has been trying to calm markets, but it has become obvious that their loose policy cannot be maintained forever,  one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.  The baseline (expectation for debt markets) has not changed.      While Central European bond yields are mostly higher then euro zone peers, some of the region's markets are also helped by good liquidity.     The Hungarian central bank has been pumping liquidity into markets via its unorthodox toolkit in the past year.     In Romania, large debt redemptions supported government bonds despite worries that the government's policies will lead to a jump in the budget deficit and inflation.     An auction of 19-month Romanian bonds is expected to draw healthy demand on Thursday, with a likely cut-off yield below Wednesday's closing bid of 1.28 percent, ING analysts said in a note.      With a cautious tone from the Fed's president yesterday, we could still see some positive price action today as well, though ROMGBs have been doing better than peers recently, so maybe there are limited incentives for market participants to chase yields lower,  they said.     A good supply in Czech crown cash and cheap money from foreign currency swaps could also generate strong demand at a Treasury bill auction in Prague.      It is likely we will be moving again strongly to negative yield, in the first auction in a month and half,  a trader said.

If severe heat waves related to climate change become more common in the coming years, researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory have concluded that 10 percent to 30 percent of fully loaded planes may have to shed payload during the hottest parts of the day or delay flight until cooler hours.  Our results suggest that weight restrictions may impose a non-trivial cost on airlines and impact aviation operations around the world,  said Ethan Coffel, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at Columbia. As a result of climate change, the study says that average temperatures are expected to go up as much as an additional 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) worldwide by the end of the century.  The group's research also suggests that heat waves will become more frequent and annual maximum daily temperatures at airports will increase by 4-8 C (7.2-14.4 F) by 2080. Commercial planes, especially regional jets with smaller, less powerful engines, have a harder time in the heat because warm air is less dense, making jet engines less efficient during takeoff.  Extreme heat is already grounding some flights. Last month, American Airlines was forced to cancel or delay dozens of short-haul flights in the U.S. southwest, due to triple-digit temperatures. While changing weather patterns can undoubtedly pose a problem for carriers, pilots and airlines are no strangers to managing tricky weather patterns, said Captain Billy Nolen, Senior Vice President of the trade group Airlines for America. While heat often forces weight restrictions on planes, Nolen said an easier way to mitigate the heat's effects is to change to a longer runway, which gives the aircraft more time to reach an optimal speed for takeoff. Other times,  it's as simple as waiting for the temperature to cool off a couple degrees,  Nolen said.

Retailers and BT made gains but the FTSE 100 inched up just 0.1 percent, lagging Europe's 0.5 percent rise. Troubled construction services company Carillion, which has seen 70 percent of its market value wiped out since a profit warning and the exit of its CEO on Monday, slipped another 3.3 percent as JPMorgan slashed its  overweight  rating to  neutral . Investors shunned AstraZeneca shares, which slid 4.3 percent to the bottom of the FTSE after a media report claimed Chief Executive Pascal Soriot could be preparing to defect to Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Some analysts questioned whether reports of a move suggested the results of the company's MYSTIC trial of a lung cancer candidate could fail.  We find it hard to believe a Soriot departure would have direct read-across to [key lung cancer trial] Mystic, and would favour remuneration and the UK mood music as at least a key part of the explanation,  said Liberum analyst Roger Franklin.  Any significant fall today could therefore be a buying opportunity for long-term investors,  he added. The company declined to deny the report. BT led blue-chip gainers and Europe's telecoms sector , up 3.2 percent after UK broker Numis started covering the company with a 'buy' rating.  Earlier this year the company and Ofcom gave many BT shareholders much heartache, but at current levels we believe the share price discounts some incredible assumptions,  Numis analysts wrote. Retailers Marks & Spencer and Next made solid gains, as investors read across from stronger results reported by French supermarket Casino, lifting retailers across Europe. N Brown slid as much as 9 percent, the worst mid-cap faller, after the plus-size fashion retailer said it would incur an exceptional charge of up to 40 million pounds ($52 million) for potential customer redress on flaws in products sold between 2006 and 2014. Helping support the mid-cap index, however, were Ocado , up 2.2 percent after Credit Suisse raised its target price on the stock, predicting the online grocer would expand margins through automation.  Whereas we think the market has tended to view Ocado's latest-generation facility as the endpoint of the investment case, we believe this platform will allow Ocado to drive widespread automation and monetise its intellectual property,  analysts at the Swiss bank wrote. Barclays said fears of the impact on housebuilders from potential interest rate rises were 'overblown', upping its ratings on some firms. McCarthy & Stone  fell 1.9 percent, however, after the broker cut it to 'underweight' because of its greater reliance on the second-hand market.

When Reuters visited the floor where friends say Liu is being treated, visitors for other patients on the same ward seemed confused and asked why there were new procedures when security questioned them and checked their IDs. Nothing has appeared in Chinese-language official media since Liu was diagnosed with cancer in late May. Searches for  Liu Xiaobo  on Chinese social media show no results. China's foreign ministry answers questions from international media at its daily briefing with the standard line: China is a country ruled by law and the case is an internal affair; other countries should not meddle.  Asked on Thursday why questions and answers on Liu were missing from the foreign ministry website, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: “If you can decide how to write [your reports], then I think as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we can decide what goes online or not.”  The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid published by the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, is the only publication that regularly writes articles about Liu, in English, and usually to rebuff international criticism.     The paper has cast Liu as an outsider marginalized from society whose cause has failed inside China.  It was “overseas dissidents  who are the most active in  hyping the issue” and are trying to “boost their image by ‘deifying’ Liu,” the Global Times said in a Monday editorial. “Western mainstream society is much less enthusiastic than before in interfering with China's sovereign affairs,” it said. Charter 08 Liu was the co-author of a pro-democracy manifesto called Charter 08, which attracted more than 10,000 signatures online before the authorities deleted the document from internet pages and chatrooms. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, a year after he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion.  Charter '08, issued in 2008, reflected an apparent shift in China at the time toward becoming more open to liberal ideals, said Beijing-based historian and political commentator Zhang Lifan. That changed when Xi Jinping came to power in 2013.  Since (Liu) was sentenced, peaceful transformation as a route for change has essentially been blocked off by the party. Since the new administration came into office, the party is moving in the opposite direction,  he said. Hu Jia, a well-known Beijing-based dissident and friend of Liu's, says few people in China know anything about him or his work. Pro-democracy activists continue their sit-in demanding the release of Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 12, 2017.Bobby Yip The reality is that if you are on the streets of Beijing and you stop a hundred people, to have one know who Liu Xiaobo is would be a great result,  he said.  Chinese society, due to internet censorship and being cut off from the rest of the world, essentially does not get to hear our (dissident) voices. Protesting voices on Weibo are almost not existent these days,  Hu said. But Xi has helped the dissident movement by locking up a peaceful protester and letting him die in detention.  The last state to do that was Nazi Germany,  Hu says.  Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist who died in 1938 in Nazi Germany's Berlin, was the last Nobel Peace Prize winner to live out his dying days under state surveillance. 'Need to Act' Slideshow (2 Images)While China's censorship makes it difficult to assess Liu's support, he is a  hero  for many liberals in China, even if few will speak out for him, a Chinese editor at an online publication said, declining to be named.  I am really not sure if it's accurate to claim he is unknown to the public, (or if) people are just too scared to show their knowledge (of Liu),  the editor said. Despite the restrictions, internet posters have written in support of Liu and his cause, using variations on his name to avoid the censors.  When it comes to freedom, comes to constitutional government, we have talked too much, now we need to act,  read one comment on the micro-blogging platform Weibo.  Situations like Liu Xiaobo's are still a worry, but we nevertheless need people to act, bravely face the risk of death and act.    The post echoed something Liu wrote in April 1989 when he  returned from studying in the United States to take part in the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square: intellectuals often  just talk , they  do not do .  He's leaving, but we cannot see, cannot speak, cannot act  said the headline of an article shared as an image on the popular messaging platform, WeChat, a method that can slow down the censors. In the article, three people born in the 1980s were interviewed about Liu.  I will see him as a very important symbol, (but) people like him fail to get attention from common folk, and given his plight as an unknown prisoner of conscience, there is little to say,  one person identified as L said in the article. Albert Ho, who heads the Hong Kong Alliance organizing protests in Liu's support, said China's efforts to erase Liu from people's memory will fail.      Don't underestimate the power of the internet ... And don't underestimate the people. I have seen many episodes where suddenly the hero gets degraded into the devil and the devil becomes the hero,  he said, referring to previous shifts in China's political system.  People are not living in an open society in China so you never know,  he said.

The push for easier terms, a major concern among Japanese utilities after the Fukushima nuclear disaster six years ago led to a surge in LNG imports and drove prices higher, got a boost when the country's anti-trust regulator last month ruled restrictions in supply contracts were anti-competitive.   We have re-negotiations under way, including price review,  said Takashi Higo, senior general manager at the gas resources department of Tokyo Gas.  There will be tough negotiations (with suppliers) and it will take a lot of time,  he added, speaking to reporters at an energy conference. The decision by Japan's Fair Trade Commission to rule that so-called destination clauses that restrict resale of LNG cargoes are anti-competitive is likely to lead to more trading by buyers in Japan and could prompt challenges to similar restrictions elsewhere in Asia. FILE PHOTO - Gas tanks of Tokyo Gas Co.,Ltd are seen in the city of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, Japan, September 4, 2015.Yuya ShinoAsian LNG buyers have long complained that having destination clauses in LNG contracts unfairly restricts trading of the fuel at times when it would make more economic sense for buyers to on-sell supplies to other markets.  I 100-percent agree with the decision of Japan's Fair Trade Commission,  International Energy Agency's chief economist, Laszlo Varro, said on Thursday at the same conference.  Destination restrictions are restricting markets.  Higo said Tokyo Gas has 12 supply contracts and it is reviewing their terms to decide what action to take.  Tokyo Gas has long-term LNG supply deals with Qatargas I, Brunei LNG, Malaysia LNG Dua, Russia's Sakhalin LNG, as well as with Australia's Withnell Bay, Darwin, Pluto, Queensland Curtis LNG and Gorgon projects. Its earliest contract, with Qatargas, expires in 2021. The latest one, with Gorgon, expires in 2039.

If severe heat waves related to climate change become more common in the coming years, researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory have concluded that 10 percent to 30 percent of fully loaded planes may have to shed payload during the hottest parts of the day or delay flight until cooler hours.  Our results suggest that weight restrictions may impose a non-trivial cost on airlines and impact aviation operations around the world,  said Ethan Coffel, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at Columbia. As a result of climate change, the study says that average temperatures are expected to go up as much as an additional 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) worldwide by the end of the century.  The group's research also suggests that heat waves will become more frequent and annual maximum daily temperatures at airports will increase by 4-8 C (7.2-14.4 F) by 2080. Commercial planes, especially regional jets with smaller, less powerful engines, have a harder time in the heat because warm air is less dense, making jet engines less efficient during takeoff.  Extreme heat is already grounding some flights. Last month, American Airlines was forced to cancel or delay dozens of short-haul flights in the U.S. southwest, due to triple-digit temperatures. While changing weather patterns can undoubtedly pose a problem for carriers, pilots and airlines are no strangers to managing tricky weather patterns, said Captain Billy Nolen, Senior Vice President of the trade group Airlines for America. While heat often forces weight restrictions on planes, Nolen said an easier way to mitigate the heat's effects is to change to a longer runway, which gives the aircraft more time to reach an optimal speed for takeoff. Other times,  it's as simple as waiting for the temperature to cool off a couple degrees,  Nolen said.

Airlines may increasingly be forced to cut their loads of passengers, cargo or fuel in order to take off safely because warming air lessens the ability of airplane wings to generate lift, according to U.S. researchers. Worldwide, average temperatures are expected to climb some 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit (3 Celsius) by 2100, researchers said. But it is more prevalent heat waves that pose a larger threat to the airline industry, they said in a study published in the journal Climate Change. Annual maximum daily temperatures at airports could rise by 7 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit (4 to 8 Celsius) by 2080, they found, leading to more costly delays in take-offs or cancellations. During the hottest parts of the day, between 10 and 30 percent of fully loaded planes may have to dump weight in order to begin their journey. The phenomenon could force the aviation industry to brace for thinner profit margins, the authors said. A full 160-seat aircraft trying to safely take off in searing heat may, for instance, need to remove 13 passenger, said the study. But the costs of delays or cancellations could also disrupt other sectors of the economy as they trickle down, they said.  Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost,  said Ethan Coffel, the study's lead author and a researcher at Columbia University in New York City, in a statement. Airports likely to be most affected according to the researchers' appraisal of 19 major airports include New York's LaGuardia, due to short runways, and Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates, because of scorching heat. Projections found the least affected airports included New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, London's Heathrow and Paris' Charles de Gaulle. Last month, major airlines were forced to delay or cancel dozens of flights out of Las Vegas and Phoenix airports, citing difficulty in operating aircraft amid a heat wave. Previous research has found that changes in climate may increase turbulence on flights, the researchers said. They said their study was the first such global analysis.

The one trillion ton iceberg, measuring 5,800 square km, calved away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica sometime between July 10 and 12, said scientists at the University of Swansea and the British Antarctic Survey. The iceberg, which is roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware or the Indonesian island of Bali, has been close to breaking off for a few months. Throughout the Antarctic winter, scientists monitored the progress of the rift in the ice shelf using the European Space Agency satellites.   The iceberg is one of the largest recorded and its future progress is difficult to predict,  said Adrian Luckman, professor at Swansea University and lead investigator of Project MIDAS, which has been monitoring the ice shelf for years.   It may remain in one piece but is more likely to break into fragments. Some of the ice may remain in the area for decades, while parts of the iceberg may drift north into warmer waters,  he added. The ice will add to risks for ships now it has broken off. The peninsula is outside major trade routes but the main destination for cruise ships visiting from South America. A section of an iceberg – about 6,000 sq km – broke away as part of the natural cycle of iceberg calving off the Larsen-C ice shelf in Antarctica in this satellite image released by the European Space Agency on July 12, 2017.  Courtesy ESA/Handout via REUTERS   ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY.In 2007, more than 150 passengers and crew were evacuated after the MS Explorer sank after striking an iceberg off the Antarctic peninsula. The iceberg, which is likely to be named A68, was already floating before it broke away so there is no immediate impact on sea levels, but the calving has left the Larsen C ice shelf reduced in area by more than 12 percent. The Larsen A and B ice shelves, which were situated further north on the Antarctic Peninsula, collapsed in 1995 and 2002, respectively.  Slideshow (4 Images) This resulted in the dramatic acceleration of the glaciers behind them, with larger volumes of ice entering the ocean and contributing to sea-level rise,  said David Vaughan, glaciologist and director of science at British Antarctic Survey.  If Larsen C now starts to retreat significantly and eventually collapses, then we will see another contribution to sea level rise,  he added. Big icebergs break off Antarctica naturally, meaning scientists are not linking the rift to manmade climate change. The ice, however, is a part of the Antarctic peninsula that has warmed fast in recent decades.  In the ensuing months and years, the ice shelf could either gradually regrow, or may suffer further calving events which may eventually lead to collapse – opinions in the scientific community are divided,  Luckman said.  Our models say it will be less stable, but any future collapse remains years or decades away.

Charter 08 Liu was the co-author of a pro-democracy manifesto called Charter 08, which attracted more than 10,000 signatures online before the authorities deleted the document from internet pages and chatrooms. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, a year after he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion. Charter '08, issued in 2008, reflected an apparent shift in China at the time towards becoming more open to liberal ideals, said Beijing-based historian and political commentator Zhang Lifan. That changed when Xi Jinping came to power in 2013.  Since (Liu) was sentenced, peaceful transformation as a route for change has essentially been blocked off by the party. Since the new administration came into office, the party is moving in the opposite direction,  he said. Hu Jia, a well-known Beijing-based dissident and friend of Liu's, says few people in China know anything about him or his work.  The reality is that if you are on the streets of Beijing and you stop a hundred people, to have one know who Liu Xiaobo is would be a great result,  he said.  Chinese society, due to internet censorship and being cut off from the rest of the world, essentially does not get to hear our (dissident) voices. Protesting voices on Weibo are almost not existent these days,  Hu said. But Xi has helped the dissident movement by locking up a peaceful protester and letting him die in detention.  The last state to do that was Nazi Germany,  Hu says. Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist who died in 1938 in Nazi Germany's Berlin, was the last Nobel Peace Prize winner to live out his dying days under state surveillance. 'Need to Act' While China's censorship makes it difficult to assess Liu's support, he is a  hero  for many liberals in China, even if few will speak out for him, a Chinese editor at an online publication said, declining to be named.  I am really not sure if it's accurate to claim he is unknown to the public, (or if) people are just too scared to show their knowledge (of Liu),  the editor said. Despite the restrictions, internet posters have written in support of Liu and his cause, using variations on his name to avoid the censors.  When it comes to freedom, comes to constitutional government, we have talked too much, now we need to act,  read one comment on the micro-blogging platform Weibo.  Situations like Liu Xiaobo's are still a worry, but we nevertheless need people to act, bravely face the risk of death and act.  The post echoed something Liu wrote in April 1989 when he returned from studying in the United States to take part in the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square: intellectuals often  just talk , they  do not do .  He's leaving, but we cannot see, cannot speak, cannot act  said the headline of an article shared as an image on the popular messaging platform, WeChat, a method that can slow down the censors. In the article, three people born in the 1980s were interviewed about Liu.  I will see him as a very important symbol, (but) people like him fail to get attention from common folk, and given his plight as an unknown prisoner of conscience, there is little to say,  one person identified as L said in the article. Albert Ho, who heads the Hong Kong Alliance organising protests in Liu's support, said China's efforts to erase Liu from people's memory will fail.  Don't underestimate the power of the internet ... And don't underestimate the people. I have seen many episodes where suddenly the hero gets degraded into the devil and the devil becomes the hero,  he said, referring to previous shifts in China's political system.  People are not living in an open society in China so you never know,  he said.

Randal Quarles, a former Wall Street lawyer and U.S. Treasury official who now runs an investment firm, was part of a team that invested in troubled or failed banks while he was an executive at private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O). Those investments earned hundreds of millions of dollars for Carlyle, profits that would not have been possible without government support. A spokesman for Quarles did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Carlyle declined to comment. Democrats including Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown have said they intend to scrutinize Quarles' ties to Wall Street during his confirmation hearing. Senator Elizabeth Warren described him as  straight off the Wall Street assembly line  in announcing her opposition in a statement. But both the White House and Congress are controlled by Republicans, who have the ability to approve Trump's nominees with a simple majority after Senate rules were changed in 2013. Under previous rules, the party in power would have needed at least 60 votes. Quarles is viewed by many policy analysts as a business-friendly pick who benefits from having experience in the federal government and his business ties are unlikely to be viewed by senior senators his Wall Street ties as a handicap.   Profiting in the markets isn't a scarlet letter in this Congress,  said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Trading & Research LLC, in Washington. Before launching The Cynosure Group in 2014, Quarles was a partner and managing director at Carlyle. While there, he played a key role in making a $75 million investment in Boston Private Financial Holdings Inc (BPFH.O), and was also part of a group that decided to jointly acquire failed lender BankUnited Inc (BKU.N) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), alongside private equity peers Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), Centerbridge Partners LP and WL Ross & Co, as well as banker John Kanas. Months after Carlyle's equity infusion, Boston Private received a $150 million bailout from the Treasury Department, which it later repaid. Those taxpayer funds helped the firm weather the financial crisis, and allowed Carlyle to sell off its stake over time for a total of $150 million, effectively doubling its money, according to a Reuters review of share sales the firm disclosed in regulatory filings. The FDIC had absorbed BankUnited's losses at an estimated cost of $4.9 billion before selling healthier assets to the private equity consortium for $945 million. BankUnited later went public, with Carlyle selling shares worth around $428 million in portions through 2014, according to Reuters' analysis of its disclosures. The tallies do not account for dividends or other undisclosed costs. Carlyle would not provide precise numbers for returns on those investments. Involvement with taxpayer bailouts helped sink the earlier nomination of General Electric Co (GE.N) executive David Nason for the Federal Reserve supervisory position. Nason withdrew from vetting after Republicans criticized him for having structured the bailout program inside the Treasury Department during the Bush administration. But Wilbur Ross, whose WL Ross & Co was part of the consortium that invested in BankUnited alongside Carlyle, successfully became U.S. Commerce Secretary. Quarles' history on Wall Street may be a talking point during his confirmation hearings, but it is unlikely to bring down his nomination, lobbyists and financial regulatory lawyers said.  At the end of the day, it's really a 'nothingburger,'  said Bob Kurucza, a partner in Goodwin Procter's financial industry and investment management practice.

Altice is aiming to go beyond just France and has requested a banking license from the European Central Bank (ECB), said the source, confirming an earlier report by newspaper Le Parisien. The ECB was not immediately available for a comment. The bank would be named Alticebank and would operate across its European networks. In Europe, Altice owns French telecoms group SFR and is also present in Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland.

The one trillion ton iceberg, measuring 5,800 square km, calved away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica sometime between July 10 and 12, said scientists at the University of Swansea and the British Antarctic Survey. The iceberg, which is roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware or the Indonesian island of Bali, has been close to breaking off for a few months. Throughout the Antarctic winter, scientists monitored the progress of the rift in the ice shelf using the European Space Agency satellites.   The iceberg is one of the largest recorded and its future progress is difficult to predict,  said Adrian Luckman, professor at Swansea University and lead investigator of Project MIDAS, which has been monitoring the ice shelf for years.   It may remain in one piece but is more likely to break into fragments. Some of the ice may remain in the area for decades, while parts of the iceberg may drift north into warmer waters,  he added. The ice will add to risks for ships now it has broken off. The peninsula is outside major trade routes but the main destination for cruise ships visiting from South America. A section of an iceberg – about 6,000 sq km – broke away as part of the natural cycle of iceberg calving off the Larsen-C ice shelf in Antarctica in this satellite image released by the European Space Agency on July 12, 2017.  Courtesy ESA/Handout via REUTERS   ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY.In 2007, more than 150 passengers and crew were evacuated after the MS Explorer sank after striking an iceberg off the Antarctic peninsula. The iceberg, which is likely to be named A68, was already floating before it broke away so there is no immediate impact on sea levels, but the calving has left the Larsen C ice shelf reduced in area by more than 12 percent. The Larsen A and B ice shelves, which were situated further north on the Antarctic Peninsula, collapsed in 1995 and 2002, respectively.  Slideshow (4 Images) This resulted in the dramatic acceleration of the glaciers behind them, with larger volumes of ice entering the ocean and contributing to sea-level rise,  said David Vaughan, glaciologist and director of science at British Antarctic Survey.  If Larsen C now starts to retreat significantly and eventually collapses, then we will see another contribution to sea level rise,  he added. Big icebergs break off Antarctica naturally, meaning scientists are not linking the rift to manmade climate change. The ice, however, is a part of the Antarctic peninsula that has warmed fast in recent decades.  In the ensuing months and years, the ice shelf could either gradually regrow, or may suffer further calving events which may eventually lead to collapse – opinions in the scientific community are divided,  Luckman said.  Our models say it will be less stable, but any future collapse remains years or decades away.

The dollar retreated to nine-month lows, battered by Yellen saying the U.S. economy was healthy enough to withstand higher rates but low inflation meant interest rates may not rise  all that much further . Ten-year U.S. yields eased to 10-day lows around 2.31 percent.  As long as U.S. interest rates consolidate and fears about a move to well north of 2.5 percent remain in check, the positive tone in emerging markets that prevailed prior to mid-June should resume,  Societe Generale analyst Jason Daw said. There was also reassurance from within emerging markets as Chinese exports and imports rose at a double-digit pace, pointing to the continued trade recovery. MSCI's emerging equity index rose almost 1 percent and was set for its best weekly gain since mid-March, with bourses in India and Korea hitting record highs and Hong Kong shares rallying more than 1 percent to two-year peaks . JPMorgan's ELMI Plus index, a proxy for emerging currencies, closed on Thursday at the highest in a month. Currencies firmed almost across the board, with South Africa's rand, having posted its best daily gain on Thursday since April of 2.5 percent, firmed a further 0.3 percent. Turkey's lira, which along with the rand is most vulnerable to higher U.S. rates, rose 0.25 percent to a one-week high . However, bulls were checked by data showing Turkey's current account gap widened to $5.24 billion in May, up from $3.1 billion a year earlier and significantly exceeding forecasts. Russia's rouble meanwhile tracked a slump in oil prices to slip 0.4 percent, though Russian shares struggled higher to six-week highs. Morgan Stanley noted that of 64 local debt markets it tracked, only one had ended Thursday with negative returns.  This rally should extend from here, supporting our view that central banks leaning against financial conditions...may slow the risk rally, but not derail it,  Morgan Stanley added. On external debt, sovereign emerging debt yield premia to Treasuries slipped to 10-day lows. Emerging primary bond markets were also buoyant, with Indonesia's 10- 30-year dollar bonds strongly oversubscribed. It also sold a one billion-euro issue. Russia's Gazprom was marketing a Swiss franc bond, while Russian lender Alfabank is hoping to issue a euro-rouble deal, despite concerns about oil prices. Friday is the deadline for creditors of the International Bank of Azerbaijan to vote on debt restructuring terms. Results will be announced on July 18 but the bank says investors holding 87 percent of the debt have agreed to support it. Elsewhere, Brazil's real was flat after Thursday's 1.5 percent jump. The gains, which also encompassed sovereign Eurobonds, were partly due to a 10-year sentence handed to left-wing ex-President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva. The corruption conviction may prevent him contesting next year's election.

Soriot, who has led the Anglo-Swedish company since 2012, met with Teva's search committee and its chairman to express his agreement to serve as its next CEO, the Calcalist financial news website said late on Wednesday. Both companies said they did not comment on market rumors.  Teva was left without a permanent CEO in February after Erez Vigodman stepped down, leaving new management to try to restore confidence in the world's biggest generic drugmaker after a series of missteps. Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh also resigned at the end of June. AstraZeneca's shares fell to a two-month low of 49.21 pounds on Thursday. Teva's shares traded up 4 pct to 114.5 shekels in Tel Aviv.     Moving to a generics drugmaker, albeit the world's largest, would be a big change in direction for French-born Soriot, 58, who had made research-based pharma his whole aim at AstraZeneca. During his five years at the company he successfully defended Astra against a $118 billion takeover approach from Pfizer. He has rebuilt AstraZeneca's drugs pipeline, both through research and acquisitions, to replace lost revenue from a wave of patent expiries on many of its blockbuster medicines in recent years.  Soriot is now waiting for all-important data from a MYSTIC trial of a lung cancer candidate, which Goldman Sachs has said will be one of the year's most important clinical readouts. The report of Soriot's departure unnerved some investors and prompted analysts to question whether reports of a move suggested that the results could fail.    Such a move only makes sense if Mystic is expected to disappoint,  said Trinity Delta analyst Mick Cooper. However UBS analysts, who described Soriot as well-regarded, said they did not see a readacross.   We do not see the reports, even if true, as any indication of the specific results of the MYSTIC trial,  they said.  If Astra knew the results, they would have announced them.   UBS said one positive interpretation of the report could be that Soriot believes a lot of the restructuring is done.   Calcalist said Soriot was expected to earn twice as much as Vigodman and receive a bonus upon signing the contract, estimated at about $20 million. It said the financial terms were still being discussed. Teva's chairman, Sol Barer, said in May his top priority was the continuing global search to identify a candidate with  deep and broad pharmaceutical experience  to serve as Teva's permanent CEO. Then chairman Yitzhak Peterburg replaced Vigodman on a temporary basis. When asked whether Teva might waive its requirement for the CEO to be based in Israel, Barer said in May:  We are looking around the world for the best candidate. We are committed once we find that candidate to do what it takes to bring that candidate to Teva.  AstraZeneca has been active in Israel since 2009.

The firm has seen 70 percent of its market value wiped out since a profit warning and the exit of its CEO on Monday while its bondholders have braced for  painful  talks as a pile-up of receivables and debt spooked investors. The latest disclosure data from the UK's FCA shows that while some hedge funds have covered some bearish bets on the stock over the past few days, others have held on, or even raised them, suggesting they see further declines ahead. Carillion remains one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the UK. The difficulties investors are having in putting a price on Carillion shares was evident in volatile trading with the stock swinging between losses of as much as 10 percent to gains of 2 percent in the first two hours of trade. In its downgrade, JPMorgan said a further provision against receivables may be required, suggesting Carillion may face difficulties recovering money owed to it by its customers. Those views were echoed by analysts at Morgan Stanley who added that for now the balance sheet overshadows operating performance and debt reduction from a combination of asset sales, cost cutting and potential capital raising via fresh equity may be required. The company, which was demerged from the Tarmac group in 1999 and went on to buy construction firm Alfred McAlpine, has said it is considering all options to cut debt. A profit warning over customer payments owed that it could no longer expect to be able to collect led to a 845 million pound ($1.1 billion) writedown, prompted its boss to quit and triggered worries about a rights issue The total number of Carillion shares sold short by hedge funds has declined slightly to 23.3 percent of outstanding shares from 25.5 percent, according to regulatory filings. Of the 19 funds with disclosed short positions before Carillion's profit warning, three - Marshall Wace Asia, Kuvari Capital Management and Kuvari Partners - have seen their positions fall below 0.5 percent, the level at which funds are required to disclose positions to the regulator the Financial Conduct Authority. Five more firms have cut their short positions, while four -- Man Group's AHL, Gladstone Capital, Henderson and funds run by BlackRock -- have added to bearish bets.

Sixth seed Konta finds herself the sole focus of the home nation's hopes a day after men's defending champion Andy Murray's painful quarter-final exit.

Five-time winner Williams, 37 and seeded 10, will be aiming for her ninth Wimbledon singles final, and victory on Saturday would make her the oldest women's grand slam champion since tennis turned professional.

The proposals come just as exchanges around the world are trying to win the listing of state-controlled oil giant Saudi Aramco, which is expected to be the largest initial public offering (IPO) in history. Reuters reported in May that the London Stock Exchange was working on a new type of listing structure that would make it more attractive for Aramco to join the bourse. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Thursday that currently there is a gap in the Britain's listing rules for companies controlled by sovereign companies. It said it is proposing a new  premium  stock market listing category that will exempt companies controlled by sovereign states from certain requirements. Under the FCA's proposals, sovereign-controlled companies will be able to obtain a  premium  listing on the London Stock Exchange without complying with certain rules on related party transactions and controlling shareholders. Currently companies which do not meet Britain's  premium  listing requirements have to take a standard listing. These are seen as less attractive for investors and companies as they have lower corporate governance requirements, do not qualify for entry into most stock indices and have connotations of being second best.

Death rates from malaria have dropped by 60 percent since 2000, according to the WHO, but attempts to end one of the world's deadliest diseases - which kills around 430,000 people a year - are under threat as mosquitoes become increasingly resistant to measures such as insecticide-treated bed nets and anti-malarial drugs. BASF's new net is based on chlorfenapyr, which has been used in agriculture and urban pest control for over two decades, but BASF reworked it to make it effective on mosquito nets and meet targets for the public health market. It said the net will provide protection for at least three years or 20 washes. The new Interceptor G2 insecticide-treated net is expected to be available to health ministries and aid organisations from towards the end of this year, BASF said. BASF is also waiting for the WHO to evaluate another chlorfenapyr product, an indoor spray for walls and ceilings called Sylando 240SC.  This development breakthrough strengthens my personal belief that we really can be the generation to end malaria for good,  Egon Weinmueller, head of BASF's public health business, said.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.4 percent, slightly ahead of euro zone stocks and blue-chips , with rate-sensitive real estate stocks, which were top gainers on Wednesday, tracking more modest gains. On Wednesday, the European benchmark posted its best day since Emmanuel Macron's victory in the first round of French presidential elections, as banks and yield plays rallied.  With stocks having come off in the last few weeks, maybe investors were thinking now is the time to take the opportunity of that pullback and add some more,  said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  Yellen's speech was a catalyst for that.  Cyclicals were back to the fore on Thursday, however, with banks, which gain from higher rates, up 0.6 percent. Continued strength among miners, up 1.5 percent and near a three-month high, supported the index.  Our view remains that government bond yields will move higher, and that leaves us still favouring the less rate-sensitive parts of the stock market, cyclicals, while we're more cautious on defensives,  Bell added. Earnings began trickling in from a string of French companies. Supermarket Casino jumped 4.6 percent, bolstering gains among retailers, after its second-quarter sales growth accelerated, helped by a brightening domestic picture and a resilient performance in Brazil despite the recession there.  The beat is likely helped by good weather annualizing against a period of poor weather and strikes,  said Bernstein retail analyst Bruno Monteyne.  What's not clear at this stage is whether, like Carrefour, the sales beat at Casino will have come at the cost of higher promotions and price cuts,  he added. Shares in French industrial group Alstom, in which the French state has a 20 percent stake, rose 2.9 percent after it reported sales improved from a year ago, and maintained financial targets. Umicore jumped 4 percent higher after a top-ranked analyst at ABN Amro added the Belgian chemicals group to their 'conviction list', citing capacity increases in the company's battery business, as growth prospects for the electric car industry improve. Souring sentiment somewhat, shares in Mercedes maker Daimler fell 1.5 percent to the bottom of the DAX after a report accusing the carmaker of selling cars with excess emissions. Drugmaker Astrazeneca was the worst European performer after a report Chief Executive Pascal Soriot was to be named CEO of Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries .

The Jupiter Express carrying about 35,000 tonnes of diesel loaded from BP's Cherry Point, Washington refinery on June 29 and is currently headed to Botany Bay, New South Wales in Australia, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed.  BP declined to comment. Australia imports most of its diesel requirements from Singapore, South Korea and Japan but several refineries undergoing maintenance and prompt demand from India has tightened supply of the fuel in Asia, traders said.  The decision was (likely) made due to far east premium strength, Singapore (cash premium) strength versus bringing a vessel down,  a trader with a North Asian refiner said. The cash differential for diesel with 10-parts-per-million (ppm) sulfur, a grade imported by Australia, rose to a six-month high in early July, Reuters data showed. BP last shipped diesel from the United States to Australia in December, a shipbroker said, though such cargo movements were unheard of before that.  United States usually ships most of its diesel exports to Europe than Asia due to cheaper freight rates, traders said. But a rise in Singapore cash premiums for diesel has attracted the unusual reverse arbitrage flow of diesel from Europe to Asia, they added. BP has chartered the long-range Nan Lin Wan and Front Antares tankers for loading out of the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage and refining hub in mid-July, headed to Asia, traders and shipbrokers said.  This could also be prompting the unusual flow of diesel cargo from the United States to Australia, the traders added.  I think going forward, it's going to be more and more common to see this kind of reverse flows as Asian demand for oil products like jet fuel and diesel is growing phenomenally,  a Singapore-based trader said.  But the unusual diesel imports could ease in the third quarter as refineries are expected to return from maintenance and as India's imports of the fuel taper off due to the start of monsoon rains which typically reduce the need of the fuel in irrigation pumps.

The world's youngest country plunged into civil war in 2013 just two years after gaining independence after Kiir fired his deputy, triggering a conflict fought largely along ethnic lines. The conflict has slashed oil revenues and paralyzed agriculture. Civil servants and soldiers go unpaid for months and hyperinflation renders money almost worthless. On Wednesday evening, Kiir issued a decree that dismissed a group of 12 judges who went on strike in a bid to force reform in the judicial system, Deputy Information Minister Akol Paul Kordit told Reuters.  These judges who were supposed to deliver justice obstructed justice themselves. They denied our people justice for reasons that could be resolved through administrative channels,  he said. The group comprised of appeals court judges who demanded that the chief justice resigned on grounds that he obstructed the judicial system, as well as more judges he appointed and promoted.  These were the demands we put forward. Now the complainers have been sacked,  said Guri Raymondo, a spokesman for the judges' union.   We will seat down and hear from the general assembly what is the next step,  he told Reuters. Junior judges receive a salary of 4,000 South Sudan pounds ($25) a month in the country of 12 million people, where a kilo of rice costs 130 pounds. There are 150 pounds to the dollar on the black market. South Sudan had only 274 judges on its payroll in its last budget, some of whom have since resigned. War in the country has forced more than a quarter of its entire population to flee their homes and plunged parts of it into famine, creating Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.

Metro hopes the split will allow the independent companies to pursue more acquisitions and trigger a revaluation of the stock as Metro has traded at a discount to other pure wholesale retailers such as Sysco and Britain's Booker.  We welcome the split as it is likely to unlock value for investors,  Equinet analysts Christian Bruns and Mark Josefson, who rated the combined company a  buy , wrote in a note. However, the companies have warned that trading is likely to be volatile in the early days, especially as the split means adjustments are needed in the German mid-cap index in which Metro was listed. Shares in the Metro food business traded at 19.47 euros by 0735 GMT, while those of the consumer electronics business, to be renamed Ceconomy were at 9.33 euros, together slightly below the 29.185 euros for the combined group at the close of trading on Wednesday.  Bankers had spent the last few weeks meeting investors, informing them about the two companies and drumming up demand for the shares.

We remain cautious on Metro's perennial problems. It remains to be seen to what extent the new combined businesses will be able to finally reduce the high exceptional charges and optimize the tax rate,  said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne. Monteyne noted that the Metro food business, which makes the bulk of its profit in Russia, will be more exposed to the volatile rouble than the combined group and called on the company to disclose more details on the Russian and German businesses in future.

The billboards and full-page media ads that have appeared across Hungary depict a smiling Soros -- a vocal critic of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government -- with the caption:  Don't let Soros have the last laugh.  Some Soros billboards have been defaced with graffiti that reads  stinking Jew .  The Federation of Hungarian Jewish Federations (Mazsihisz) has urged Orban to halt the campaign, which a spokesman for Soros said earlier this week was reminiscent of  Europe's darkest hours . Orban's government has strongly denied that the billboard campaign is anti-Semitic. Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told Reuters the campaign, which was a follow-up to the launch by Orban of a  national consultation  on issues of foreign influence and mass immigration, would expire on July 15.  The six-week follow-up campaign will run out on July 15,  Kovacs said in an emailed reply to Reuters questions. Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew who has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro-democracy and human rights groups, has repeatedly been targeted by Hungary's right-wing government, in particular over his support for more open immigration. Kovacs said the campaign's end-date had nothing to do with the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Budapest next week. He declined to say how much the massive billboard campaign had cost.  Orban will seek a third consecutive term at elections in April 2018.   Hungarian government poster portraying financier George Soros and saying  Don't let George Soros have the last laugh  is seen at an underground stop in Budapest, Hungary July 11, 2017.Laszlo BaloghHe launched the poster campaign portraying Soros as an enemy of Hungary after voters who responded to the government's  national consultation  rejected both  foreign influence  and mass immigration.  Israel's ambassador to Hungary initially denounced the campaign, saying it  evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear , an apparent reference to Hungary's part in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust. But the Israeli foreign ministry later issued a  clarification  saying that Soros was a legitimate target for criticism, a move that appeared designed to align Israel more closely with Hungary ahead of Netanyahu's visit to Budapest.  Slideshow (2 Images)Israel is normally quick to denounce anti-Semitism or threats to Jewish communities anywhere in the world. While it made that point in the statement, it chose to focus on the threat it believes Soros poses to Israeli democracy. Among the organizations Soros funds is Human Rights Watch, which is frequently critical of Israel's occupation of the West Bank and its policies toward the Palestinians.  Soros, 86, who emigrated from Hungary after World War Two, made his fortune in the United States and has long supported groups promoting liberal, democratic and open-border values in eastern Europe. Orban has long proclaimed zero tolerance for anti-Semitism, though he has more recently risked angering Jews with remarks apparently meant to court far-right voters. In a statement on Thursday, former United Nations chief Kofi Annan expressed deep concern about the poster campaign, which he said played on  xenophobic sentiments . Noting the thousands of Hungarians who emigrated after the 1956 revolution, Annan said he hoped Hungary would  find a way out of its current isolation and back to the values enshrined in the U.N. refugee convention and U.N. charter for human rights .   Reporting by Krisztina Than; Editing by Catherine Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/hungary-soros-idUSL8N1K4173"},

The law passed on Tuesday raises the minimum marriage age to 18 from 16 and removes all exceptions for child marriage, meaning that girls and boys under 18 cannot get married even with the permission of their parents. Belinda Portillo from children's charity Plan International said Honduras had  made history  by passing the law in a country where one in four children are married before the age of 18.  The fight against child marriage is a strategic way of promoting the rights and empowerment of women in various areas, such as health, education, work, freedom from violence,  Portillo, Plan's Honduras country director, said in a statement. Enforcing the law will be hardest in indigenous communities and poor rural areas in Honduras where child marriage is most prevalent, campaigners say. Often driven by poverty and cultural acceptance, child marriage usually involves a girl marrying an older man and deprives girls of education and opportunities, keeping them in poverty. Each year more than 15 million girls worldwide are married before they turn 18, campaign group Girls Not Brides says. Experts say child brides are more likely to be victims of sexual and domestic abuse and become teenage mothers. Pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death for girls aged 15 to 19 globally. Portillo said banning child marriage in Honduras would give girls a chance to be better educated and increase their earnings, helping to boost the country's annual gross domestic product by about 3.5 percent.  In a report last month, the World Bank said child marriage will cost developing countries trillions of dollars by 2030, hampering global efforts to eradicate poverty. Most Latin American countries ban marriage until 18, but many of them still allow children to get married at a younger age with the permission of parents or a judge. Campaigners hope other countries in Latin America will follow Honduras's example. Lawmakers in the Dominican Republic - a country with the second highest rate of child marriage in the region - along with El Salvador are mulling proposed reforms to outlaw child marriage.

The star performer was the Canadian dollar, which rocketed to 11-month highs after the country's central bank hiked rates for the first time in seven years and left the door wide open to further moves. The overall mood was one of relief that Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen had not sounded more hawkish in her appearance before Congress, a green light for risk taking. Sentiment got another boost when China reported upbeat data on exports and imports for June, the latest sign that global trade is finding some real traction again. It had helped push Asian shares up more than 1 percent and lift MSCI's 47-country world index to its latest record high, though Europe barely budged. Traders there were happy to take a breather after a 1.6 percent gain on Wednesday had given the region its best day since April's French election victory for Emmanuel Macron.  It mostly seems to be down to Yellen,  Rabobank quantitative analyst Bas Van Geffen said.  The fact that it seems like the Fed is going to take it slowly is being seen as a good sign by the equity markets and by the currency markets.  One of the Fed chief's comments that markets latched on to was her view that bank would not need to raise U.S. rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the  neutral  funds rate. Equities were also underpinned by a drop in bond yields as Yellen also sounded cautious on inflation. Spooked last month by an outbreak of harmony among top central banks about tightening policy, debt markets jitters appear to have evaporated again. Indeed, markets doubt even that modest Fed tightening will ensue and imply only a 50-50 chance of a rise by December . Treasuries rallied in reaction, with yields on two-year notes falling to three-week lows, as did bonds in Europe and Asia. Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield was flat on the day at 0.51 percent. They have now given back a quarter of the rise triggered by last month's hint from ECB head Mario Draghi that it was readying to scale back stimulus. Treasuries meanwhile have clawed back a third of their selloff.  The market did perceive a greater degree of anxiety over inflation – at the margin,  said Westpac's U.S. economist, Elliot Clarke.  To our mind, this is unlikely to get in the way of another hike this year.   Two further hikes in 2018 will likely be justified by conditions. However, the case for additional hikes thereafter is nowhere near being made.  Oh Canada The odd one out was Canada, where yields hit their highest since late 2013 after the Bank of Canada raised rates a quarter point saying the economy no longer needed as much stimulus. The Canadian dollar notched its biggest percentage gain since March 2016 and was last trading near one-year peaks at C$1.2740. The Aussie and Kiwi dollars jetted higher too. The main loser was the U.S. dollar which slipped to 112.97 on the yen, while the euro edged up to $1.1451. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was within a whisker of nine-month lows at 95.650. The drop in U.S. yields benefited gold, which pays no interest, and pushed the precious metal up 0.3 percent to $1,223.16 and away from its recent trough of $1,204.45. Oil prices flatlined as producer club OPEC said it expected demand to decline next year as rivals pump more, though the Chinese trade data showed it remained a heavy buyer. Brent crude futures were off 4 cents at $47.70 a barrel, while U.S. crude eased 5 cents to $45.44. Asia's share market gains had also lifted Indian stocks to an all-time high. South Korea and Australia's main indexes both climbed 1.1 percent too, the former helped as its central bank kept interest rates at a record low. Japan's Nikkei was restrained by a firmer yen and ended flat.  Dollar positioning is short and yesterday's testimony just confirmed what the market believed: that the Fed is not going to be able to be as hawkish as they are suggesting,  said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 FX strategy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London.

American announced on Wednesday that it was cancelling code-share agreements with Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways as  an extension of our stance against the illegal subsidies that these carriers receive from their governments.  Both Middle East airlines deny they are state subsidized. American's decision to end the agreements which allow airlines to book passengers on each other's flights, ramps up an acrimonious dispute between U.S. carriers and Gulf competitors over competitive advantages. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said on Thursday he was disappointed by the decision, but it would not affect the Middle East carrier's plans to buy up to a 10 percent stake in American, announced last month.  Our stock purchase request and filing is going ahead as normal. We had to clarify certain questions of the regulator, which we compiled with,  al-Baker told reporters in Doha. Qatar Airways sent a revised antitrust filing to U.S. regulators on Wednesday seeking clearance to buy up to a 10 percent stake in the U.S. carrier, according to the filing. A stake in American would add to Qatar Airways' investment portfolio, which already includes a 20 percent stake in British Airways-owner International Airlines Group (ICAG.L) and 10 percent of South America's LATAM LAN.SN. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker, however, said in a letter to his employees last month that  We aren't particularly excited about Qatar's outreach  and that it was puzzling given the U.S. carrier's very public stance on state support given to Gulf carriers.

They are pressing the United States government to curb the Middle Eastern carriers' access to U.S. airports, and the White House is considering their request, according to government officials and airline executives who have spoken to the White House.  Al-Baker said American's decision to end the code-share agreement was  not in the spirit of the one world alliance  and that Qatar Airways had other partners in the United States  who want to work with us.   Slideshow (3 Images)Qatar Airways, American Airlines, IAG's British Airways, Iberia and LATAM are all members of the one world airline alliance. Al-Baker previously said Qatar Airways would buy American shares on the open market before formally seeking board approval from the U.S. carrier to increase its ownership. [nL8N1JX389] The U.S. airline's own rules require advance approval from its board for the purchase of a stake of 4.75 percent or more.  American said on Wednesday that cancelling code-sharing agreements with Qatar Airways and Etihad would not have a material financial impact for the U.S. carrier.

The company's shares have surged to a three-month high after it found potentially more than a billion barrels of oil in the Mexican Zama field, which Wood Mackenzie analysts called one of the 20 largest shallow-water finds in two decades. The North Sea player has essentially put a stop to exploring for new oil and gas deposits in North Sea waters as it looks for growth in underexplored areas such as Brazil and Mexico.  If we can dig out opportunities like Zama, world-class fields that we've been able to work our way into, then frankly you would never choose UK exploration over an opportunity like that,  Premier Oil Chief Executive Tony Durrant told Reuters. The Zama field will not come on stream before 2022 or 2023, Durrant said, and the major investment needed to develop it would not be required this year or next. Premier Oil has been struggling with mounting debt accumulated as it spent money to bring new projects on stream at the same time as weak oil prices slashed its income. It is now turning a corner with its debt falling further over the past few months to $2.74 billion and a debt refinancing deal expected to close at the end of the month. Premier Oil also said in a trading update on Thursday that first-half revenue would be more than 40 percent higher than a year ago at about $560 million, thanks to target-beating production levels averaging 82,100 barrels per day. However, it maintained its full-year production target of an average 75,000 bpd, saying this could be revised at the end of August when it publishes its full six-month earnings. Premier Oil also reduced its full-year capital expenditure (capex) by another $25 million to $325 million but it said it would only break even if prices rise above $50 a barrel. Benchmark Brent crude prices were trading at around $47.50 a barrel on Thursday. Premier Oil shares were 4 percent lower at 0825 GMT following the trading update, though that was still 30 percent higher than before the Zama discovery was announced.  Looking into 2018 things should improve with Catcher on stream and capex falling away but the deleveraging process will be painfully slow if oil prices don't recover,  said analysts at Mirabaud Securities. Premier Oil's Catcher field in the North Sea is set to come on stream later this year. (Editing by David Clarke)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/premier-oil-outlook-idUSL8N1K41FH"},

American announced on Wednesday that it was cancelling code-share agreements with Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways as  an extension of our stance against the illegal subsidies that these carriers receive from their governments.  Both Middle East airlines deny they are state subsidized. American's decision to end the agreements which allow airlines to book passengers on each other's flights, ramps up an acrimonious dispute between U.S. carriers and Gulf competitors over competitive advantages. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said on Thursday he was disappointed by the decision, but it would not affect the Middle East carrier's plans to buy up to a 10 percent stake in American, announced last month.  Our stock purchase request and filing is going ahead as normal. We had to clarify certain questions of the regulator, which we compiled with,  al-Baker told reporters in Doha. Qatar Airways sent a revised antitrust filing to U.S. regulators on Wednesday seeking clearance to buy up to a 10 percent stake in the U.S. carrier, according to the filing. A stake in American would add to Qatar Airways' investment portfolio, which already includes a 20 percent stake in British Airways-owner International Airlines Group (ICAG.L) and 10 percent of South America's LATAM LAN.SN. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker, however, said in a letter to his employees last month that  We aren't particularly excited about Qatar's outreach  and that it was puzzling given the U.S. carrier's very public stance on state support given to Gulf carriers.

They are pressing the United States government to curb the Middle Eastern carriers' access to U.S. airports, and the White House is considering their request, according to government officials and airline executives who have spoken to the White House.  Al-Baker said American's decision to end the code-share agreement was  not in the spirit of the one world alliance  and that Qatar Airways had other partners in the United States  who want to work with us.   Slideshow (3 Images)Qatar Airways, American Airlines, IAG's British Airways, Iberia and LATAM are all members of the one world airline alliance. Al-Baker previously said Qatar Airways would buy American shares on the open market before formally seeking board approval from the U.S. carrier to increase its ownership. [nL8N1JX389] The U.S. airline's own rules require advance approval from its board for the purchase of a stake of 4.75 percent or more.  American said on Wednesday that cancelling code-sharing agreements with Qatar Airways and Etihad would not have a material financial impact for the U.S. carrier. Etihad, which flies to six U.S. cities, accused American of being “anti-competitive” and “anti-consumer  and said it was disappointed with the decision.

Earnings are already squeezed by low interest rates and the highly competitive business environment. Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), due to be phased in by 2022, will increase banks' funding costs, hurting profitability for regional banks in particular. Banks will need to build their loss-absorbing debt and capital buffers to meet MREL, but investors' appetite for hybrid and subordinated debt issued by weaker regional banks is likely to have reduced following the recent resolution of Banco Popular, which wiped out junior bondholders. We estimate that issuing MREL-eligible instruments could cost regional banks 13%-23% of their 2016 net interest income on average, compared with 4%-9% for nationwide banks. The proportionally higher costs could ultimately threaten regional banks' ability to survive independently, meaning an increase in mergers and acquisitions. However, we expect regional banks to defend their independence, and their ownership structures and close ties with their local economies are significant hurdles to mergers or acquisitions motivated by cost synergies. Mild but steady rises in interest rates could improve banks' profitability, and implementing internal rating-based models could ease capital pressure and MREL costs, limiting the pressure for consolidation. We estimate that the adoption of the IFRS 9 international accounting standard in 2018 will reduce Spanish banks' fully loaded common equity Tier 1 ratios by an average of 51bp. The average headroom over existing requirements is 164bp, which is moderate, and we expect most banks will continue strengthening their capital through retained earnings and hybrid debt issuance. Banks' earnings are being squeezed by low interest rates and competitive pressure. We expect loan volumes to remain broadly flat in the medium term as banks continue to deal with the material stock of problem assets still undermining their capital and profitability. The scope for banks to cut operating costs in the absence of mergers is limited because additional regulatory- and technology-related costs will outweigh savings from further staff and branch reductions.

BoE policymaker Ian McCafferty told The Times newspaper in on Thursday that the central bank should consider unwinding its 435 billion pound ($562 billion) quantitative easing programme earlier than planned. But McCafferty's views do not represent the consensus on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). He was one of three who voted in favour of an interest rate increase last month, with five voting against. On Wednesday the Bank's Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said he was not yet ready to raise rates, which seemed to run contrary to warnings from other policymakers at the central bank in recent weeks that rates could be lifted soon. Such remarks had pushed sterling above $1.30 at the end of June. Investors are split on whether the BoE will raise interest rates by the end of the year, following in the footsteps of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has lifted rates twice this year, and the Bank of Canada, which increased rates on Wednesday.  The market is 50 percent priced for a hike by the end of the year – we think that overstates the risk,  said RBC Global Markets strategist Adam Cole. Sterling was up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.2936 by 0800 GMT. Against the euro it was up almost half a point at 88.22 pence, having hit an eight-month low against the single currency the previous day before strengthening on data showing wage growth still lagging inflation.  The BoE appears likely to be the next G10 central bank to begin raising interest rates, which should offer more support for the pound heading into year-end,  MUFG strategists wrote, adding that the British economy is holding up better than expected since the vote to leave the European Union.

The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings of AIIB are based on its existing and expected intrinsic strengths. Created in 2015, AIIB has been endowed with a substantial capital base which, in Fitch's view, will support the projected rapid expansion in lending; exposure to risk will be mitigated by a comprehensive set of policies and by high quality governance. AIIB enjoys an excellent level of liquidity and should benefit from easy access to capital markets. The 'aaa' intrinsic rating reflects Fitch's long-term projections for capitalisation, risks and liquidity indicators, based on the bank's business plan. Capitalisation is assessed as Excellent, as the 80 existing member states have committed to subscribe USD100bn of capital, of which USD20bn will be paid-in. As the bank expands its operations - the loan portfolio should reach USD50bn by 2027 - the equity to assets ratio will progressively erode, but will remain above the 25% threshold consistent with our Excellent capitalisation assessment. Risks are expected to remain Low. Based on the bank's strategy and policies, Fitch anticipates that the average rating of the loan portfolio will be around 'BB' over the 10-year forecast period. Approximately 60% of the loans will be extended to sovereign-backed borrowers, and will benefit from the preferred creditor status of AIIB, a common feature of multilateral development banks (MDBs). Concentration risk is assessed as Moderate. Given the internal limits set by the bank, the ratio of the 5 largest exposures to total banking exposures will progressively decrease and should be below 50% by 2027. AIIB will invest in some equity participations but, over time, they will account for less than 5% of the banking portfolio. Based on discussions with management, Fitch expects AIIB to pursue conservative policies, and to maintain a very low exposure to market risks, in line with peers. However, risk management policies are assessed as Moderate, as a number of limits have not been yet been set explicitly, and the model to compute economic capital has yet to be finalised. The lower limit for the credit quality of liquid assets is 'A', which is not conservative relative to AAA peers. However, given the quality of the management team overall and their stated commitment to a conservative approach, Fitch expects AIIB's liquidity policy to be managed prudently. Liquidity is assessed as Excellent, reflecting the very large liquidity buffer set by the bank, which should remain above 150% of short-term debt in the forecast period. According to AIIB's internal policy, liquid assets must cover at least 40% of annual cash requirements, which is in line with peers. Although the minimum rating level for treasury investment is 'A', Fitch expects that at least 50% of assets will be invested in assets rated 'AA-' or higher. AIIB's business profile is assessed as Medium risk, which translates into a one-notch uplift for the intrinsic rating. AIIB operates in a high-risk operating environment, evidenced by the relatively low credit quality of its countries of operations. This is offset by the Low risk business profile of the bank, stemming from its high governance standards, clear strategy and well-controlled exposure to the private sector. No credit uplift is granted for support. The average rating of key shareholders - China, India, Russia and Germany, which together own 54% of capital - is 'A-'; once the bank has reached its target size, net debt will not be covered by callable capital rated 'A+' and above. Nonetheless, the propensity of member states to provide extraordinary support is deemed Strong. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Outlook on the IDR is Stable. The factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action are: - Lending growth more rapid than anticipated, leading to the equity to assets ratio falling below 25%, which would likely exert a negative impact on our Excellent assessment of AIIB's capitalisation ratio. - Deterioration in expected asset quality leading to an average rating of 'B+' or lower or a marked increase in the impaired loan ratio. - Longer than anticipated implementation of the risk management policies or any material change to the conservative approach to liquidity and other policies articulated by AIIB's senior management. KEY ASSUMPTIONS In its projections, Fitch assumes that capital will be paid-in according to the schedule and that, by 2027, the size of the loan portfolio will reach USD50bn with an average rating of BB. Additionally, any impaired loans will be 100% provisioned, the liquidity ratio will cover more than 150% of short-term debt, and consist of investment-grade assets, with at least 50% of them invested in AAA/AA assets or bank placements.

TUI's move allowed Kuehne to expand its investment in Hapag-Lloyd, which it said it considered to be long-term.  The ongoing shipping industry consolidation offers Hapag-Lloyd new growth perspectives and strengthens its positions among the most important shipping companies across the world,  Kuehne Holding executive chairman Karl Gernandt said.

N Brown, which has a financial services arm that provides customers credit to pay for purchases, said it identified flaws in certain general insurance products that had been provided by a third-party underwriter.  The vast majority of these products were sold to the group's customers in the period leading up to and including 2011. Sales of the relevant products ceased in early 2014,  N Brown said in a statement. N Brown was the biggest faller on the FTSE mid-cap index in early trade, its shares dropping 8.8 percent to 277.5 pence. Known for its SimplyBe, Jacamo and JD Williams brands, N Brown has shrugged off weakness in the UK clothing sector thanks largely to its online sales growth, though its financial services arm has dragged down overall results. In the year to March 4 the company incurred an exceptional cost of 25.2 million pounds, predominantly related to its financial services business. A company spokesman said the products behind the latest exceptional charge were general insurance policies to cover goods being purchased. N Brown said it expects to incur a charge in this year's income statement of 35 million pounds to 40 million pounds. The company added that there may be mitigating actions to reduce the overall net cost and that the matter will not affect underlying operations, the risk profile of its customers or debtor balances. N Brown, which in June reported a 10 percent rise in first-quarter product revenue, said trading performance has been  in line  since the last update.

Indian bonds led the region with inflows of about $4 billion in June taking the total for the first half to $14.73 billion, a record for the January-June period of any year. Inflows into South Korean bonds rose for the sixth straight month in June, while Indonesian bonds also received inflows for a seventh straight month. Analysts said the huge first half inflows were mostly due to the unwinding of outflows that happened in late 2016. Data from central banks and local bond market associations in India, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea showed foreigners net sold $15 billion in these bond markets in the second half of last year.  The bond inflows we have seen in the first half have been very strong. It is going to be very difficult to sustain those kinds of inflows,  said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ in Singapore.  Over the second half of this year, we have the (Federal Reserve) starting to normalize their balance sheet, and potentially other major central banks in the world  could be looking to remove accommodation. So we will start to see an easing of inflows in the second half of this year,  Goh said. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years saying the economy no longer needed as much stimulus, while Fed Chair Janet Yellen said interest rates hikes would be gradual and that the U.S. central bank may not be able to raise rates by  all that much.   Malaysian bonds saw meager sales of about $70 million in June after witnessing positive flows in the previous two months.  The second quarter of the year was a turnaround for Malaysian bond markets as foreigners returned, purchasing bonds after dumping them between November 2016 and March this year due to a central bank's crackdown on the onshore ringgit trading market. Overall, analysts expect some outflows in the second half of the year, but they reckon the threat to the regional currencies would not be severe as it was during taper-tantrum, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first hinted that it might taper its monetary expansion policy. Improved foreign reserve buffers in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, South Korea and Southeast Asia, which rose by $153 billion to $5.4 trillion in the first half, will help calm the markets, UOB said in a report.   As such the region has a stronger war chest of reserves to support their currencies.  Analysts also said some bond inflows could be expected in  countries such as India and Indonesia where interest rate cuts are expected later this year.   A rate cut will be bullish for bonds because it will push bond prices high which will make it attractive for investors,  said Goh.

Against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength, the U.S. dollar fell back to its lowest since last October in Asian trading, undoing all of a recovery last week driven by generally higher global bond yields. The currency was steadier in early deals in Europe but still another quarter of a percent lower since the end of U.S. trading on Wednesday. The kiwi and Aussie dollars rode out a poor set of New Zealand data to stand 0.6 percent higher on the day, leading gains for the G10 group of developed world currencies along with the Swedish crown.  The market was not really buying the dollar even during the hottest moments of the past two weeks,  said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 FX strategy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London.  Dollar positioning is short and yesterday's testimony just confirmed what the market believed: that the Fed is not going to be able to be as hawkish as they are suggesting.  By 0740 GMT, the dollar index was trading 0.2 percent lower at 95.588, having hit an 8-month low of 95.464. It dipped 0.15 percent to $1.1430 per euro but was roughly flat at 113.09 yen. The U.S. currency has been falling steadily since hitting a 14-year high at the start of this year and a number of major banks who had previously backed it to gain further have called its longer-term rally as over. But against that is the continuing contrast in interest rates - and the outlook for them - in the United States and Europe and Japan. U.S. 10-year interest rates are 4 times - or almost 2 full percentage points - higher than those in Germany. Yellen sounded a cautious note on inflation going forward, putting the focus on U.S. consumer price index (CPI) numbers due on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the June core CPI figure to have risen 0.2 percent month-on-month, from a gain of 0.1 percent the previous month.  Our data suggests that U.S. inflation is actually picking up again,  said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.  The Fed appears to still be in a position to continue hiking rates.

An upturn in global demand for Chinese goods could cushion the impact on growth from curbs on property and debt risks, which have seen a modest tightening in monetary conditions, economists said. The government has targeted annual growth of around 6.5 percent this year, down from the 6.7 percent pace clocked in 2016 -  the slowest in 26 years - as authorities stepped up their campaign to wean the economy off its reliance on years of cheap credit.   Growth in the world's second-biggest economy is projected to continue cooling to 6.3 percent in 2018, the Reuters poll of 65 economists showed. The forecasts for this year and in 2018 were both more optimistic than the polling results three months prior, as a slew of official data in recent months eased worries about a sharper downturn in China's economy.  We raised our forecast because the economy has fared much better than expected in the first half of the year,  said Betty Wang, a Hong-Kong based senior economist with ANZ Research. China's economy grew a surprisingly solid 6.9 percent in the first quarter, buoyed by a gravity-defying property boom and higher government infrastructure spending which helped boost industrial output by the most in over two years. However, the impact of a cooling property sector on economic growth is starting to show up, as fixed asset investment growth in May slowed more than expected.  Tightening Regulations The Chinese government has sought to tame soaring property prices by slapping a flurry of restrictive measures, stoking  fears of a market collapse as real estate is a major contributor to economic growth.      A regulatory crackdown on unscrupulous lending and a modest shift to tighter monetary condition have fueled funding costs, as authorities seek to contain a dangerous build-up in debt that has ballooned to 277 percent of gross domestic product.    Yet, policymakers have been treading captiously in tapping the brakes ahead of a key party meeting in the autumn at which there will be a change in the top leadership.  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) held back from matching a U.S. interest rate hike in June despite capital outflow pressures, and has injected liquidity into the market to avoid a credit crunch. While growth in the second quarter is expected to have eased slightly according to the poll, solid exports in recent months have helped the economy weather tighter financial conditions. Data on Thursday showed China's exports rose a stronger-than-expected 11.3 percent in June from a year earlier.  There are actually overshooting risks in the second half even as growth is set to be slower,  said ANZ's Wang.  On a quarterly basis, China's economy is expected to slow to 6.8 percent growth in the second quarter, 6.6 percent in the third and 6.5 percent in fourth quarter, the poll showed. Still, analysts remain cautious about the longer-term economic prospects of the Asian giant. Property curbs and higher borrowing costs could gain more traction over the coming quarters.  You don't feel the pain initially,  said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.  Companies can make do with less credit for now, but then lending starts to slow, as monetary conditions are still tighter, and that will eventually start to hurt,  he said, adding that the transmission time could take up to nine months. Analysts believe the PBOC will keep benchmark lending rates unchanged at 4.35 percent through at least the fourth quarter of 2018, the Reuters poll showed.  They have pushed back their expectations on a cut in the amount of cash that banks are required hold as reserves, or the reserve requirement ratio (RRR). The central bank is expected to cut the RRR by 50 basis points (bps) in the first quarter of 2018 to 16.5 percent, versus the April poll's prediction for the 50 bps cut to be made in the fourth quarter of this year. Analysts also expect annual inflation to be more muted at 1.8 percent in 2017, down from the actual 2 percent rate in 2016, probably reflecting a drag from low food inflation.

The Philippines, one of the world's biggest rice importers, usually buys from major sellers Vietnam and Thailand, where export prices have fallen amid weak demand. The National Food Authority (NFA) is seeking supply of 25 percent broken long grain white rice for delivery between August and September to boost its thinning stockpile ahead of the typhoon season later this year. That variety is trading at around $393-$398 a tonne in Vietnam RI-VNBKN25-P1 and quoted at $393 a tonne RI-THWHT25-A by the Thai Rice Exporters Association.  That (price ceiling) is the average of all the rice prices including (shipping) expenses,  Tomas Escarez, head of the bids and awards panel at the NFA, told reporters after meeting with prospective bidders. The NFA's initial list of prospective bidders includes Olam International Ltd and Louis Dreyfus Corp of Singapore, and Vietnam Northern Food Corp, also known as Vinafood I, and Vinafood II. Thai suppliers Asia Golden Rice Co Ltd, Ponglarp Co Ltd, Thai Hua Co Ltd, Capital Cereals Co Ltd and Thai Granlux International Inc, and Vietnamese traders Gentraco and Gia International Corp are also interested in bidding, the NFA said. Bids must be submitted on or before July 25, when the sealed offers will be opened. The NFA will award a maximum 50,000 tonnes to each winning bidder. State inventories have shrunk to the least in more than three years, just enough to cover five days of national requirement, or just a fraction of the 30-day buffer stock required during the lean harvest season from July to September. Escarez said the NFA will also allow local private rice traders to import up to 805,000 tonnes of rice under an annual quota scheme, which should arrive between December and February next year.

Lula, a giant on the Brazilian political scene who led Brazil from 2003 to 2011, has said he wants to run for president again next year. But if his nearly 10-year sentence is upheld on appeal, Lula, a founder of the leftist Workers Party, would be barred from seeking office again for eight years, beginning after any jail time is complete.  Lula, 71, is among a raft of Brazilian elites toppled by an epic corruption scandal that has battered the nation's economy, engulfed every major party and deepened public cynicism about politics. It's a toxic mix that has enraged voters, who are searching for someone to lead them out of the political and economic wilderness.  Brazil is now as polarized as the U.S., it really has been for years,  said Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a Sao Paulo business school.  But if Lula is absent it would unquestionably open the space for an outside, very emotional leader, a bit like U.S. President Trump.  Lula was convicted on Wednesday by Judge Sergio Moro, who found Lula guilty of accepting 3.7 million reais ($1.15 million) worth of bribes from engineering firm OAS SA [OAS.UL]. That is the amount prosecutors said the company spent refurbishing a beach apartment for Lula in return for his help winning contracts with state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro. OAS was part of a supplier cartel that prosecutors said fleeced billions of dollars from Petrobras through inflated contracts, funneling some of the ill-gotten gains to politicians and political parties. Several OAS executives were jailed by Moro, the hard-charging judge overseeing the so-called Car Wash investigation, the largest-ever corruption probe in Brazil’s history. Lula' lawyers said he is innocent. He will remain free while his attorneys appeal the ruling, which they have characterized as a political witch hunt. The appeals court is expected to take at least eight months to rule.  This politically motivated judgment attacks Brazil's rule of law, democracy and Lula's basic human rights,  Lula's defense team wrote in an emailed statement.  It is of immense concern to the Brazilian people and to the international community.   The Race Despite his legal woes, the charismatic Lula remains Brazil's best-known politician and has retained a base of loyal supporters. As president, he channeled resources from a commodities boom into social programs that helped lift millions from poverty. Recent surveys from the respected Datafolha polling institute show that in a second-round runoff next year, Lula would beat all contenders with the exception of the environmentalist and two-time presidential candidate Marina Silva, with whom he is in a technical tie. But if Lula cannot run, and with roughly 20 percent of the electorate undecided on any candidate, the election is up for grabs.  Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva arrives at Federal Justice, with senator Gleisi Hoffmann (R) for a testimony in Curitiba, Brazil, May 10, 2017.Nacho DoceWhile Silva has polled well, Melo and other political watchers doubt that the soft-spoken, environmental expert could win, in part because her campaigns have lacked the fiery speeches and dramatic flair needed to engage many voters. The public's thirst for showmanship and anti-establishment candidates, Melo said, could give a boost to two outsiders: Ciro Gomes, a tough-talking former governor, federal minister and congressmen who is now with the Democratic Workers Party; and Joao Doria, a millionaire media mogul and former star of Brazil's version of  The Apprentice.  Gomes, despite his long career in politics, is a rough-and-tumble politician who could easily position himself as an anti-government candidate. Loud and politically incorrect, Gomes called unpopular President Michel Temer, himself facing a corruption charge, the  captain of the coup  that led to the impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff last year. Doria, who had never held elected office before, stunned the political establishment last year when he won the mayorship of South America's largest city in the first round, capturing 53 percent of the vote. A member of the centrist Brazilian Social Democracy Party, he is loved by the business community for his pro-market stance. And he has caught the public's attention with stunts such as donning a street sweeper's uniform and spending days cleaning roadways. Shortly after the Lula verdict was made public Wednesday, Doria posted on Twitter that  Justice has been done.   The most shameless man in Brazil was condemned to nine and a half years in prison,  Doria continued.  Long live Brazil.   The latest Datafolha polls shows Gomes and Doria in a technical tie in a second-round presidential vote next year.  A right-wing, law-and-order candidate, congressman Jair Bolsonaro, of the Social Christian Party, also has polled well, taking 15 percent of a simulated first-round vote in the Datafolha survey, putting him behind only Lula.  But political watchers caution his appeal is likely to wane as opponents dig into his trove of anti-gay, pro-dictatorship utterances. Bolsonaro is facing a trial before Brazil's Supreme Court for inciting violence after he told a female congresswoman on the floor of the lower house that he  would not rape her because she would not be worthy of it.   Sergio Praca, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a leading Brazilian University, said he sees the Lula conviction as giving all politicians a deep scare rather than any one candidate a bounce.  This conviction is a black mark on Brazil's history. But it is a great moment in the fight against impunity,  Praca said.   The Brazilian voter will no longer accept a presidential candidate who is not clean, and that is a real evolution in our democracy,  he added.  In this trying moment, that is the positive outlook we have to hold onto.  Editing by Marla Dickerson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-lula-analysis-idUSKBN19Y0CM"},

OPEC's compliance with cuts slumped to 78 percent last month from 95 percent in May as higher-than-allowed output from Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Iraq, the UAE and Venezuela offset strong compliance from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Angola.  Each month something seems to come along to raise doubts about the pace of the rebalancing process. This month, there are two hitches: a dramatic recovery in oil production from Libya and Nigeria and a lower rate of compliance by OPEC with its own output agreement,  the Paris-based IEA said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-OPEC producers including Russia have agreed to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018 to ease a global crude glut spurred by booming U.S. output.  OPEC members Libya and Nigeria were exempted from the cuts due to years of unrest that have sapped their output. The two countries have managed to increase their combined production by more than 700,000 bpd in recent months, the IEA said.  For fellow OPEC members, who agreed to reduce production by 1.2 million bpd, to see their cut effectively diluted by nearly two-thirds must be very frustrating, especially as their pact has, hitherto, been well observed by historical standards,  the IEA said.  The cuts have stabilized oil at around $45-50 per barrel, but prices have come under renewed pressure in recent weeks due to growing U.S. output and little evidence of global stocks falling from record highs above 3 billion barrels. The IEA, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said strong demand growth in the second half of 2017 and in 2018 should nevertheless speed up market rebalancing. It said demand for OPEC's crude was forecast to rise steadily through 2017 and reach 33.6 million bpd in the fourth quarter - up 1 million bpd on OPEC's June output.   Provided there is strong compliance with OPEC's cuts, that would imply a hefty stock draw, even if Libya and Nigeria recover further,  it said. The IEA said stocks in industrialized nations in May were 266 million barrels above the five-year average, down from 300 million barrels in April. Preliminary data shows a further moderate reduction in stocks for June. The agency also said that while non-OPEC producers such as the United States, Canada and Brazil were firmly back in growth mode, the recent decline in oil prices could force some U.S. producers to reassess their prospects.   Financial data suggests that while output might be gushing, profits are not and recent press reports quoted leading company executives saying that oil prices need to be around $50 per barrel to maintain production growth,  the IEA said.

German exports are currently benefitting from a revival of world trade. But they are likely to grow less sharply in adjusted terms than imports, which are also heading upwards,  the ministry added. This showed how the current account surplus was continuing its slow downward trend, which started in mid-2016, it said. Industrial output has risen for five months in a row since the beginning of the year and sentiment indicators such as the closely watched Ifo index suggest that business morale has reached record highs, the ministry said.  Consumer prices continue to rise significantly. Still, consumer spending keeps on increasing in real terms,  it said, adding that employment levels were rising, albeit at a slower pace.

The ruling marked a stunning fall for Lula, one of the country's most popular politicians, and a serious blow to his chances of a political comeback. The former union leader, who won global praise for policies to reduce stinging inequality in Brazil, faces four more corruption trials and will remain free on appeal. The verdict represented the highest-profile conviction yet in a sweeping corruption investigation that for over three years has rattled Brazil, revealing a sprawling system of graft at top levels of business and government. Judge Sergio Moro found Lula, 71, guilty of accepting 3.7 million reais ($1.2 million) worth of bribes from engineering firm OAS SA, the amount of money prosecutors said the company spent refurbishing a beach apartment for Lula in return for his help winning contracts with state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro (PETR4.SA).  Federal prosecutors have accused Lula, Brazil's first working-class president from 2003 to 2011, of masterminding a long-running corruption scheme that was uncovered in a probe into kickbacks around Petrobras.   Lula's legal team said in an emailed statement that he was innocent and they would appeal.   For over three years, Lula has been subject to a politically motivated investigation,  they wrote.  No credible evidence of guilt has been produced, and overwhelming proof of his innocence blatantly ignored.  Lula's lawyer Cristiano Martins has repeatedly accused judge Moro of being biased against his client, which Moro strongly denies.  Related CoverageBrazil's Lula to appeal conviction: lawyerMoro wrote in his ruling that he  took no personal satisfaction in this conviction, quite to the contrary.   It's lamentable that a president of the republic is criminally convicted,  Moro said.  No matter how important you are, no one is above the law.   The Brazilian real BRBY extended gains following the decision and reached its strongest in two months. The benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP rose to a session high. Investors fear that another Lula presidency would mean a return to more state-directed and less business friendly economic policies.  Power Vacuum on Left  Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is seen during the inauguration of the new National Directory of the Workers' Party, in Brasilia, Brazil July 5, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoLula would be barred from office if his guilty verdict is upheld by an appeals court, which is expected to take at least eight months to rule. If he cannot run, political analysts say Brazil's left would be thrown into disarray, forced to rebuild and somehow find a leader who can emerge from the immense shadow that Lula has cast on Brazilian politics for three decades.  Lula's absence opens a gaping hole in the political scene, it creates an enormous power vacuum on the left,  said Claudio Couto, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a top university.  We have now entered a situation of extreme political tension, even beyond the chaos we have been living for the last year.  Couto said he expected Lula's guilty verdict to be upheld by the appeals court. That would leave the 2018 presidential race wide open and raise chances of a victory by a political outsider, given most known contenders are also ensnared in Brazil's corruption investigations. Slideshow (15 Images)Boom to Bust Lula's two-terms were marked by a commodity boom that momentarily made Brazil one of the world's fastest-growing economies. His ambitious foreign policies, aligning Brazil with other big developing nations, raised the country's profile on the global stage. With Lula's swagger setting the tone, Brazil sought to shrug off northern economic and political hegemony and engage in global problems, like Middle East peace and the standoff over Iran's nuclear program. Former U.S. President Barack Obama once labeled him the most popular politician on earth. But upon leaving office and managing to get his hand-selected successor Dilma Rousseff elected, Brazil's economy soured, with the nation just now beginning to emerge from its worst recession on record. Rousseff was impeached last year for breaking budgetary rules. She and her backers say her ouster was actually a 'coup' orchestrated by her vice president and now President Michel Temer, who himself faces corruption charges.  During his trial, Lula gave five hours of fiery and defiant defense, proclaiming his innocence and saying that it was politics and not the pilfering of public funds that put him on trial.     But what is happening is not getting me down, just motivating me to go out and talk more,  Lula said in his testimony.  I will keep fighting.

Metro hopes the split will allow the independent companies to pursue more acquisitions and trigger a revaluation of the stock as Metro has traded at a discount to other pure wholesale retailers such as Sysco and Britain's Booker.  We welcome the split as it is likely to unlock value for investors,  Equinet analysts Christian Bruns and Mark Josefson, who rated the combined company a  buy , wrote in a note. However, the companies have warned that trading is likely to be volatile in the early days, especially as the split means adjustments are needed in the German mid-cap index in which Metro was listed. Shares in the Metro food business traded at 19.47 euros by 0735 GMT, while those of the consumer electronics business, to be renamed Ceconomy were at 9.33 euros, together slightly below the 29.185 euros for the combined group at the close of trading on Wednesday.  Bankers had spent the last few weeks meeting investors, informing them about the two companies and drumming up demand for the shares.

Metro, a sprawling conglomerate, has spent several years restructuring and selling non-core businesses such as its Kaufhof department stores, to focus on its cash-and-carry business and Media-Saturn electronics chain. Slideshow (2 Images)The new food business comprises wholesale stores, which serve hotels, restaurants and independent retailers, along with Real hypermarkets in Germany. Together they had 2015-16 sales of 37 billion euros ($42.4 billion) and operate in 35 countries. Ceconomy is Europe's biggest consumer electronics business ahead of Dixons Carphone, running more than 1,000 stores in 15 European countries, with sales of 22 billion euros in 2015/16.  We remain cautious on Metro's perennial problems. It remains to be seen to what extent the new combined businesses will be able to finally reduce the high exceptional charges and optimize the tax rate,  said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne. Monteyne noted that the Metro food business, which makes the bulk of its profit in Russia, will be more exposed to the volatile rouble than the combined group and called on the company to disclose more details on the Russian and German businesses in future.

Michel Barnier, who holds a first full round of talks next week, betrayed impatience with London during a Brussels news conference. Britain had yet to respond to detailed proposals from him on many issues, he said, and had fallen short on what it has offered on citizens' rights, as well as on what it owes. Asked his view on Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's remark on Tuesday that Brussels could  go whistle  if it thought Britain would pay what Johnson called  extortionate  demands, Barnier showed no desire to join in any cross-Channel banter:  I'm not hearing any whistling, just the clock ticking,  the Frenchman said, echoing his refrain of the past year that time is tight to conclude terms for an exit in March 2019 that can limit disruption for businesses and millions of people. Barnier said he wants detailed proposals from the British next week to match those made by the EU on issues they want settled in a withdrawal treaty. These include the rights of expats left on either side of a new EU-UK border, a methodology for calculating how much Britain will owe to cover commitments to the EU and how to manage the new border, notably on Ireland. Only if there is progress on all three of these would EU leaders agree to open negotiations on a future free trade deal. For now, however, 3 million Europeans in Britain would have fewer rights under London's proposal than Britons on the continent, notably in the matter of being able to bring in relatives, he said. And those rights in Britain would not be guaranteed by the treaty or ultimately by the EU's judges in Luxembourg. European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier addresses a news conference at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, July 12, 2017.Francois LenoirNegotiating Positions Even some EU governments concede that the demand for much of the relations between Britain and the bloc to be under ultimate scrutiny by the European Court of Justice - anathema to many of those who voted for Brexit a year ago - is a  maximalist  position and may have to be moderated in negotiations. Slideshow (2 Images)An early indication of how far apart the two sides really are will come from Monday, when British officials are due in Brussels for the first of four, week-long, monthly rounds of negotiations which they hope can show enough progress to see EU leaders agree at a summit in mid-October to open trade talks. Barnier urged London to be clear on its willingness to pay a bill, which the EU executive have put at potentially 60 billion euros ($70 billion), if it wants to win the Union's trust. He dismissed suggestions from Brexit supporters that the EU was holding Britain to  ransom  and stressed that he was open to negotiating the amount  line by line  but first the British had clearly to take responsibility for their share of EU budgets.  I cannot imagine that a very great country like the United Kingdom is not a country that takes responsibility,  he said. In a sign of the domestic dramas that have delayed Britain's response, three leaders will separately see Barnier on Thursday: the first ministers of Wales, which backed Brexit, and Scotland, which did not, as well as opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn. With May hobbled by losses in a miscued snap election last month, Corbyn's Labour party and the devolved governments are pushing her to modify her Brexit plans - though Barnier stressed he would only be negotiating with British ministers.

Sindika Dokolo, a Congolese businessman and art collector, is married to dos Santos' billionaire daughter Isabel and is an outspoken critic of Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila.  He denounced Wednesday's verdict, delivered by a court in the capital Kinshasa, as politically motivated.  This conviction is so crude. It seems that Kabila and the ANR (intelligence service) are no longer even concerned about appearances,  Dokolo told Reuters. He said he had previously been acquitted in the same case.  Kabila's chief political rival, the former governor Moise Katumbi, was also convicted of real estate fraud last June shortly after he announced his candidacy to stand in an election to replace Kabila.  That election was originally scheduled for last November but has been indefinitely postponed, triggering violent street protests last year that killed dozens of people.  The government says the delays are due to challenges registering millions of voters. Opposition leaders accuse Kabila of trying to cling to power.   A Congo government spokesman said he was not aware of Dokolo's conviction. Authorities have repeatedly rejected allegations that Congo's justice system is targeting Kabila's opponents.  Dokolo has emerged in recent months as one of Kabila's fiercest critics, especially on Twitter, following the president's refusal to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in December. After Wednesday's verdict, Dokolo wrote on Twitter:  I have just inaugurated a $400 million factory. Kabila has condemned me to one year in prison over a plot of land.   He also posted a photo of himself alongside Angolan Defence Minister Joao Lourenco, the ruling party's candidate to succeed dos Santos in an election next month, writing that Lourenco has  a deep mastery of the DRC dossier .  Relations between Congo and Angola, longtime allies, have soured over the past year due to growing Angolan frustration over Congo's political instability and an insurrection in central Congo that has sent 30,000 refugees spilling across the border since last August. In December, Angola withdrew military trainers it had sent to Congo, where wars at the turn of the century killed millions and sucked in more than a half-dozen neighboring countries.

The Brahmaputra river, which flows from China down to India and then through Bangladesh, has burst its banks after torrential monsoon rains, swamping more than 2,500 villages in India's Assam state over the past two weeks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his anguish over the human suffering, with thousands of people seeking shelter in more than 300 relief camps. Authorities have declared a  maximum health alert  to stop the spread of disease. Efforts are also underway to help the rhinos and other wildlife put in danger when flood waters swamped the Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site.  More than 90 percent of the Kaziranga National Park is under water,  Assam Forest Minister Pramila Rani Brahma told Reuters. A herd of elephants cross a road that passes through the flooded Kaziranga National Park in the northeastern state of Assam, India, July 12, 2017. Picture taken July 12, 2017.Anuwar HazarikaThe 430 sq km park is home to the world's largest number of the one-horned rhinoceros, with an estimated 2,500 out of a total population of some 3,000.  Two rhino calves have drowned and up to 15 deer perished in the high floods,  Brahma said. Villagers use a boat to cross a flooded road at Asigarh village in Morigaon district in Assam, India, July 4, 2017.Anuwar HazarikaAnimals are seeking refuge on high ground, including hills outside the park, she said. But when the animals move to smaller areas of higher ground to escape the floods they become more vulnerable to poachers. They also face increasing danger of being hit by vehicles if they take refuge on roads that often run along embankments.  Special barricades have been put along the highway and forest guards are asking drivers to drive under 40 km an hour,  a park warden said, adding that a few deer had been hit by speeding trucks. The water level in the Brahmaputra is expected to keep rising until the end of this week and should then stabilize, provided there is no more heavy rain, the Central Water Commission said.

In testimony delivered to Congress on Wednesday, Yellen said the Fed would not need to raise rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the neutral fed funds rate. Bond yields in Europe and the U.S. fell sharply after the comments, which have brought some comfort to world bond markets unnerved in the past two weeks by signs that major central banks are stepping up efforts to unwind ultra-loose monetary policies.  After the strong sell off we've had over the last two weeks, we are entering into a period of relief in the short term,  said Patrick Jacques, European rates strategist at BNP Paribas. Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield was flat on the day at 0.51 percent, within sight of a one-week low hit the previous session and down from 18-month peaks set earlier this week at around 0.58 percent. Italian bond yields faced slight upward pressure ahead of a government bond auction later in the day, while other euro zone yields were steady to 1 basis point higher on the day. Data on Thursday highlighting subdued inflation in the euro zone also suggests there is no rush for the European Central Bank to scale back its monetary stimulus and should support bond markets, analysts said. Annual inflation in Germany, harmonised to compare with other European countries, was confirmed at 1.5 percent in June. Year-on-year inflation in France eased to a seven-month low of 0.8 percent in June, unchanged from a preliminary estimate.  The inflation numbers in Germany are somewhat cheering, but it is all about the overall picture for the euro zone,  said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK.  It indicates that inflationary pressure is subdued. Hence, there is no rush in changing the gear for monetary policy.  Focus was expected to turn back to the Fed later in the day, with Yellen testifying before the Senate Banking Committee.

On Wednesday, the European benchmark posted its best day since Macron's victory in the first round of presidential elections, as banks and yield plays rallied. Souring sentiment somewhat, shares in Mercedes maker Daimler fell 1.5 percent to the bottom of the DAX after a report accusing the carmaker of selling cars with excess emissions. However, continued strength among miners, which hit a near three-month high, supported the index.

The loan sale - representing about 7 percent of the bank's $39 billion offshore assets - comes as Chinese regulators move to reduce leverage and control potential systemic risk, including problems posed by domestic companies acquiring overseas assets. Hong Kong based CITIC Bank International has put 51 Asia offshore loans up for sale, most of which were made to companies based in mainland China, Basis Point reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter and a sale document. The loans are largely denominated in U.S. and Hong Kong dollars, maturing between 2017 to 2021. The largest loan up for sale is a $600 million chunk of a $12.7 billion syndicated financing facility backing China National Chemical Corp’s (ChemChina) $44 billion acquisition of pesticides and seeds group Syngenta AG, according the document and the sources, Basis Point said. CITIC Bank International, together with its parent China CITIC Bank, was the global coordinator and largest lender of the facility. The bank is also selling a HK$4 billion ($512 million) portion of a loan used to finance Hong Kong-listed Goldin Properties Holdings Ltd's take-private, HK$2 billion of lending to debt-laden property developer China Evergrande Group and $30 million to acquisitive Chinese conglomerate Fosun, according to the document and sources. Banks typically offload portfolios in the secondary market to reduce credit and liquidity risk. Bankers in receipt of the sale document said the $2.8 billion portfolio was unusually large for the Asian secondary loan market. A Hong Kong-based spokesman for CITIC Bank International said in an email statement that the sale of the loans was part of the bank's ongoing portfolio management.  The bank's liquidity maintenance ratio is well above regulatory requirements and is above peer average,  he added. Scaling Back The Chinese banking regulator is cracking down following years of aggressive lending by Chinese banks, particularly to finance overseas acquisitions. Chinese firms spent a record $221 billion on assets overseas in 2016, ranging from movie studios to football clubs.  Chinese banks' share of the Asia ex-Japan market in syndicated loans, usually used to fund acquisitions, was more than a third last year compared to about 14 percent in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Last month, China's banking regulator ordered a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group Co, Anbang Insurance Group, and Fosun, Reuters reported, without naming the banks. Several Chinese loan bankers said they were also looking to deleverage their portfolio and would be selective in lending in the second half of 2017.  We have been asked to tighten our lending in the second half after making so many loans in the past few years,  one Hong Kong-based senior loan banker told Basis Point.

Established in 2000 for fashion-conscious twenty-somethings, ASOS was an early e-commerce success story, but is seeing growing competition from the likes of British rival Boohoo and Germany's Zalando as well as from traditional store-based chains who have invested heavily in their online offerings. Shares in ASOS, which listed at 20 pence in 2001, have increased 30 percent over the last year, as the depreciation of sterling versus the U.S. dollar and euro post the Brexit vote has allowed the retailer to reduce prices and drive sales in its international markets. The stock was down 1.5 percent at 5,721 pence at 0714, reflecting some disappointment the guidance on sales was not accompanied by a profit upgrade. ASOS has a market capitalisation of 4.76 billion pounds ($6.16 billion) - not far behind Marks & Spencer's 5.12 billion pounds. ASOS said total retail sales rose 32 percent to 660.1 million pounds in the four months to June 30, with UK sales up 16 percent and international sales up 44 percent. The retail gross margin was flat versus the prior year. “Strong first half sales momentum has continued through the third period supported by our ongoing investment in our customer proposition and in price,  Chief Executive Nick Beighton said. ASOS said it expected full-year pretax profit to be in line with the market consensus of 79.4 million pounds, up from 63.7 million pounds in 2015-16.

But I think that we need a limited fiscal capacity in the euro zone in order to support single member states in case of sudden crisis,  said Regling, a German who heads the European Stability Mechanism. Such a  rainy day fund  should be roughly equivalent 1-2 percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product (GDP), Regling added. That would be roughly 100 to 200 billion euros ($115 billion to $229 billion) at present. The European Commission has also suggested that the euro zone might need to issue collective debt and run a joint budget among ideas for deeper European integration around the single currency after Britain leaves the EU in 2019. Regling said the introduction of such 'European Safe Bonds' or 'Safe Assets' would be  a huge step forwards  in principle.  With that, we would get a market in Europe that would be as deep and liquid as the one for U.S. government bonds,  Regling told the paper.  But this will only work if we partly pool government debt in the euro zone, and for this I don't see a realistic possibility in the foreseeable future,  he added. Regling backed a proposal by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that the International Monetary Fund should not take part in any future euro zone bailout, and said European Central Bank participation was no longer needed either. Turning to Greece, Regling said Athens should no longer need ESM aid loans after its current third bailout program ends in mid-2018 as long as it sticks to agreed reform measures. Regling's comments followed a fresh push from Macron who said the EU remained an incomplete project and would require changes to its treaties that bring greater convergence between euro zone member states.

Metro hopes the split will allow the independent companies to pursue more acquisitions and trigger a revaluation of the stock as Metro has traded at a discount to other pure wholesale retailers such as Sysco and Britain's Booker. Metro, a sprawling conglomerate, has spent several years restructuring and selling non-core businesses such as its Kaufhof department stores, to focus on its cash-and-carry business and Media-Saturn electronics chain.  We remain cautious on Metro's perennial problems. It remains to be seen to what extent the new combined businesses will be able to finally reduce the high exceptional charges and optimise the tax rate,  said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne. The new food business comprises wholesale stores, which serve hotels, restaurants and independent retailers, along with Real hypermarkets in Germany. Together they had 2015-16 sales of 37 billion euros ($42.4 billion) and operate in 35 countries.

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.8 percent, to 3,686.92 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.6 percent to 3,218.16 points. China's better-than-expected trade performance for June lifted market sentiment.

Today's upbeat figures point to still strong foreign demand for Chinese goods, as well as fairly resilient domestic demand,  said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics.  Looking ahead, exports should continue to do well given the relatively positive outlook for China's main trading partners.  Risk appetite also improved after Wall Street hit record peaks as investors wagered policy tightening in the United States would be glacial at best. Chinese investors continued to plow money into blue chips, helping lift sectors such as banking, raw materials and infrastructure.

Overall, global LNG export capacity would reach 650 billion cubic meters (bcm) a year by the end of 2022, compared to less than 452 bcm a year in 2016, the IEA said in its annual report on gas markets. Of that amount, Australia would have capacity to export 117.8 bcm a year of LNG, followed by the United States with 106.7 bcm a year and Qatar with 104.9 bcm a year, it said. Australia would stay top by adding 30 bcm a year of capacity by the end of 2022 to its existing capacity, but the United States, which has seen shale gas output surge, would add about 90 bcm a year to its capacity of about 14 bcm a year now.  By the end of our forecast period, the United States will be well on course to challenging Australia and Qatar for global leadership among LNG exporters,  the report said. However, the new LNG capacity is being added to an already well-supplied market, while demand is falling in some of the traditionally large importing nations, such as Japan, it said. With demand expected to reach 460 bcm a year by 2022, the market would have 190 bcm a year in excess capacity, putting pressure on gas prices and discouraging new upstream investment. Current low LNG prices are already making it tougher for exporters, and competition is loosening the typically rigid contracts that have dominated the long-distance trade.  This change will be further accelerated by the expansion of U.S. exports, which are not tied to any particular destination and so will play a major role in increasing the liquidity and flexibility of LNG trade,  the IEA said. Qatar said last week it planned to raise its LNG output by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes a year (roughly 140 bcm a year) in the next five to seven years, in what was seen as a challenge to other exporters. The IEA report did not assess the impact of Qatar's plans as  the extra capacity was expected to be in place after the report's forecast period of 2016-2022, Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA's director of energy markets and security, told reporters. Overall, the IEA said global gas production would grow faster than oil and coal in the next five years, helped by low price and ample supply, alongside a growing preference for gas because of its lower emissions compared to other fossil fuels. Global gas demand was expected to rise by 1.6 percent a year to 4,000 bcm in 2022, slightly higher than last year's forecast of 1.5 percent, the IEA said. Most of the expected growth was expected to come from developing countries, led by China. Most gas is transported by pipeline rather than on ships as LNG. The United States, the world's largest gas producer, would increase output more than any other country in the next five years, the IEA. By 2022, U.S. production was expected to be 890 bcm, accounting for 22 percent of the total global gas output.

The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) - which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) hopes to bring to a vote next week - is astonishingly unpopular, often getting less than 20 percent support in polls.  There isn’t a single state in which a majority favors the GOP’s proposals. In a starkly polarized political environment, it’s almost impossible for a major proposal to be this widely hated. So why would the House pass a similar bill, and why didn’t McConnell immediately bury it?  Many Republicans legislators are insulated from even the fiercest political backlash because the political playing field is tilted strongly towards the GOP side. Now the White House is about to make it even more so with a scheme to shrink the electorate and skew it towards the GOP.  In late June, the Trump administration announced a series of measures to constrict the body politic, making it older, whiter, and wealthier - and therefore more Republican. The Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity is asking for detailed state data about voters. There already is evidence that merely asking for the data is stopping people from registering. Voting rights experts say that because voter rolls inevitably contain errors, such as still listing voters who recently moved, the Trump administration is likely planning to use these discrepancies to justify vote suppression efforts such as onerous identification requirements. (On Monday, while awaiting the outcome of legal challenges to the request and the refusal of some secretaries of state to comply, Trump’s commission put the request on hold.)  More from Reuters Commentary  Rahmatullah Nabil and Melissa Skorka: The road to Afghanistan peace does not lie in Kabul Dan DePetris: Steve Bannon is right on Afghanistan That same week, the White House nominated Hans von Spakovsky, who has a lengthy history of making unsupported claims of voter fraud, to join the election integrity commission. The commission is chaired by Kris Kobach, Kansas’s controversial secretary of state, whose signature voter-ID bill, passed by his state’s legislature in 2011, has already been subject to four separate lawsuits by the ACLU. The commission was organized to find support for Trump’s unfounded claim that, “I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.” Its efforts thus far are designed to justify state vote suppression measures that harm Democrats without actually making election results any more reliable.  Civil rights advocates fear that in the months and years ahead state data will be used to deregister thousands or even millions of disproportionately minority voters. As voting right reporter Ari Berman puts it, Trump’s commission “appear[s] to mark the beginning of a nationwide voter-suppression campaign, based on spreading lies about voter fraud to justify enacting policies that purge the voter rolls, and make registration and voting more difficult.” This can determine the outcome of an election, as it did in the 2000 presidential race in Florida, where hundreds of thousands of voters who shared the same name as a convicted felon were disenfranchised.  Chasing imaginary voter impersonation, disenfranchising millions of eligible voters in the process, is not just an obsession of Trump’s. Republican lawyers are circulating the country urging state and local officials to purge voter rolls. Conservative lawyers are targeting districts with large numbers of racial minorities and few resources for legal defense. Republican state legislatures have also recently passed measures like requiring voters to present government-issued photo IDs and restrictions on early voting.  Republicans are doing everything they can to keep Democratic-leaning constituencies - people of color, the poor and young people - from voting. The party claims to have suddenly developed a peculiar fixation with election security, but it's plainly about constricting the electorate to protect Republicans from feeling voters' wrath over their unpopular policies. These efforts are not always well-disguised. A federal judge observed that a North Carolina voter suppression law, “target[s] African Americans with almost surgical precision.”  Between now and the next cycle of elections in 2018 and 2020, Republican state legislatures are likely to pass more and more vote suppression measures. While many of these laws have such a disparate impact on Americans of color that they appear to violate the Voting Rights Act or the Equal Protection Amendment of the Constitution, it seems unlikely that a Department of Justice headed by Trump appointee Jeff Sessions or a conservative-leaning Supreme Court will overrule them.  Republicans are so determined to shrink and tilt the electorate because they see it as the only way to hold power while advancing an unpopular agenda.  The core components of the BCRA - a massive cut to Medicaid spending, deregulation of insurance companies, less generous subsidies to buy insurance and a huge tax cut for the very wealthy - are all ideas with no sizeable popular constituency.  It’s not just healthcare. Every major item on the GOP’s agenda polls badly. After healthcare, Republicans want to pass more tax cuts for the rich, which are very unpopular among all voters except Republican elites. The rollback of environmental regulations - which under Trump’s EPA director Scott Pruitt has been one of the most consequential results of Trump’s victory - is widely despised. The public also opposes loosening workplace safety standards and defunding Planned Parenthood. The Republican agenda couldn’t be less popular if it was designed to repel majorities.  But Republicans won control of the federal government, despite losing the popular vote for president, through structural advantages that give rural and older white Americans outsized power. The Senate vastly over-represents small, predominantly white rural states. Democrats in the Senate, many representing large states such as California, have received millions more votes than their Republican colleagues who hold the majority of seats. The Electoral College, which also favors small states, allowed Donald Trump to capture the White House despite getting nearly 3 million fewer votes than Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  Unless something changes radically, we can expect a similar outcome in next year’s midterms. Polls show that Democratic House candidates will get many more votes than their Republican opponents. But because of the natural clustering of Democratic supporters in cities, and aggressive Republican gerrymandering that has given the GOP two or three times as many House seats as Democrats in states with roughly evenly split electorates such as Pennsylvania and North Carolina, that might not be enough. The Democrats could get decisively more votes and still fail to take back the House, as happened in 2012.  Most political parties try to assemble majorities by offering policies people like. The contemporary Republican Party is a different kind of party. Even if much of their legislative agenda fails, they show no signs of tacking away from their unpopular, far-right agenda. And thanks to the various ways in which Republican officials frustrate the will of the majority, they might keep getting away with it.

Suedzucker's operating profit for the three months through May rose 39.4 percent to 153 million euros ($175 million), beating analysts forecasts for 143 million euros and helped by strong revenues from sugar and biofuels. As a major player in the market, it is well placed to benefit from a radical deregulation of the EU sugar market from Sept. 30, when farmers will be free to grow as much as they want and refiners be able to sell sugar globally after decades of strict output quotas and export limits. Guaranteed minimum prices will also end.  We are looking optimistically into the new era of the liberalized EU sugar market and we are forecasting higher revenues for our sugar sector in the free EU sugar market,  a Suedzucker spokesman said. Suedzucker said on Thursday it expects operating profits from sugar in the current financial year  to rise considerably  from the 72 million euros achieved in its previous financial year as a result of the free EU market. It confirmed its previous forecast that group operating profit in its current 2017/18 financial year could reach 425 to 500 million euros, compared to 426 million euros last year.  The foundations have been created for a good sugar harvest this year with increased beet area sown in good conditions. A larger crop would keep our factories occupied and reduce unit costs,  the spokesman said.  From the end of September the EU’s limits on sugar exports will be removed and we hope to export more onto world markets. The liberalization may also mean a greater fluctuation in EU sugar prices.  Suedzucker's total sales rose 10.9 percent in its first quarter to 1.78 billion euros, and net profit increased 56.3 percent to 120 million euros. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast quarterly net profit of 74.5 million euros, and sales of 1.77 billion euros. The Suedzucker Group expanded its beet cultivation area this year by about 15 percent on last year to 443,644 hectares, amid  average to excellent planting conditions,  it said. In its pizza-to-starches special products sector it forecast a  significant decline  in operating profit in the current year on higher raw materials costs. Biofuel unit CropEnergies on Wednesday reported higher earnings and forecast increased earnings in its current financial year.

Overall, global LNG export capacity would reach 650 billion cubic meters (bcm) a year by the end of 2022, compared to less than 452 bcm a year in 2016, the IEA said in its annual report on gas markets. Of that amount, Australia would have capacity to export 117.8 bcm a year of LNG, followed by the United States with 106.7 bcm a year and Qatar with 104.9 bcm a year, it said. Australia would stay top by adding 30 bcm a year of capacity by the end of 2022 to its existing capacity, but the United States, which has seen shale gas output surge, would add about 90 bcm a year to its capacity of about 14 bcm a year now.  By the end of our forecast period, the United States will be well on course to challenging Australia and Qatar for global leadership among LNG exporters,  the report said. However, the new LNG capacity is being added to an already well-supplied market, while demand is falling in some of the traditionally large importing nations, such as Japan, it said. With demand expected to reach 460 bcm a year by 2022, the market would have 190 bcm a year in excess capacity, putting pressure on gas prices and discouraging new upstream investment. Current low LNG prices are already making it tougher for exporters, and competition is loosening the typically rigid contracts that have dominated the long-distance trade.  This change will be further accelerated by the expansion of U.S. exports, which are not tied to any particular destination and so will play a major role in increasing the liquidity and flexibility of LNG trade,  the IEA said. Qatar said last week it planned to raise its LNG output by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes a year (roughly 140 bcm a year) in the next five to seven years, in what was seen as a challenge to other exporters. The IEA report did not assess the impact of Qatar's plans as  the extra capacity was expected to be in place after the report's forecast period of 2016-2022, Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA's director of energy markets and security, told reporters. Overall, the IEA said global gas production would grow faster than oil and coal in the next five years, helped by low price and ample supply, alongside a growing preference for gas because of its lower emissions compared to other fossil fuels. Global gas demand was expected to rise by 1.6 percent a year to 4,000 bcm in 2022, slightly higher than last year's forecast of 1.5 percent, the IEA said. Most of the expected growth was expected to come from developing countries, led by China. Most gas is transported by pipeline rather than on ships as LNG. The United States, the world's largest gas producer, would increase output more than any other country in the next five years, the IEA. By 2022, U.S. production was expected to be 890 bcm, accounting for 22 percent of the total global gas output.

The Nikkei closed 0.01 percent higher at 20,099.81, while the broader Topix ended down 0.01 percent to 1,619.11. The Nikkei benchmark index managed to find support at its 25-day moving average of 20,059.58, but held to a tight range all through the session as the dollar weakened against the yen after Yellen's congressional testimony was seen as less hawkish than some traders had anticipated.  After all, Yellen's comment capped gains in the Japanese market as value stocks such as banks and autos weakened,  said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. The dollar was 0.1 percent lower at 113.02 yen after losing about 0.7 percent overnight, when it was pulled back from a four-month high near 114.495 scaled earlier in the week on expectations of U.S.-Japan monetary policy divergence. Yellen said the U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, though low inflation may leave the central bank with diminished leeway. Technology shares attracted buying as their U.S. counterparts rallied, with Tokyo Electron Ltd ending 3 percent higher and Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd closing 1.1 percent higher. Banks lost ground after U.S. yields fell, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ending 1.5 percent lower, Mizuho Financial Group declined 1.3 percent, while insurer Dai-ichi Life Holdings dropped 2.1 percent. The auto sector underperformed, closing 0.2 percent lower. Toyota Motor Corp shed 0.2 percent and Honda Motor Co dropped 0.4 percent.

MAHLE and Tata Motors, along with the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD), which is coordinating the project, received funding for developing the SL-MAC system from the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (CCAC), a global initiative to support fast action and make a difference in the areas of climate, public health, and food and energy security (www.ccacoalition.org<www.ccacoalition.org >). This project envisages use and trial of environment friendly, low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants HF01234yf (ASHRAE A2L) and HFC-152a (ASHRAE A2). A team comprising of representatives of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the Mobile Air Conditioning Society Worldwide (MACS), the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), MAHLE, Tata Motors, and IGSD reviewed the newly constructed SL-MAC system and the prototype at the MAHLE Behr facility in Lockport, New York, USA, on 7 April 2017. A Tata vehicle based on a new generation platform for utility vehicles, consisting of a more complex architecture with front and rear air conditioning system, has been selected for this joint development program. The SL-MAC system will first be installed in the Tata utility vehicle as a prototype. In the SL-MAC system, the alternative refrigerants first cool a secondary fluid/coolant, which in turn cools the air to comfortable temperatures inside the vehicle cabin. This process allows the safe use of slightly flammable refrigerants that have a low GWP and in turn achieves high cooling capacity, minimizing the losses and achieving an optimized overall thermodynamic efficiency in the process. This is in contrast to the conventional mobile AC system, where the cabin air is directly cooled by the refrigerant HFC-134a, which is ozone safe but has a high GWP] Further company coverage:","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/brief-tata-motors-and-mahle-to-develop-p-idUSFWN1K401M"},

We can also see demand from state banks,  said a currency dealer, asking not to be named. The central bank has completely stopped defending the rupee unlike in the past, Deputy Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe told Reuters on Wednesday.  Since February, we have been only buying dollars. We are not selling at all. We do not see any pressure on the rupee. It is market-driven demand and supply,  he told Reuters in an interview.  If we do not intervene and buy, probably it will appreciate. We are buying and preventing certain appreciation.  The market has priced in further depreciation due to the central bank's no-intervention policy, dealers said. The rupee has been under pressure since early this year after the central bank stopped providing support for the currency at a time when the island nation faces a balance of payments crunch. It has fallen around 2.6 percent so far this year. The spot rupee resumed trading on June 19 for the first time since May 5, when the central bank fixed its reference rate at 152.50.

The maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars, which has agreed to buy Opel from General Motors in a deal closing this year, recorded 1.58 million worldwide vehicle sales in January-June, up from 1.54 million a year earlier.     But PSA's Chinese woes deepened, with sales tumbling another 49 percent to just 152,380 vehicles and the Citroen brand down 63 percent. The prolonged slide has prompted a management and distribution shake-up as well as pledges by Chief Executive Carlos Tavares to rush out more SUVs.  Outside China, where we are restructuring our network, global sales of Citroen are increasing,  brand head Linda Jackson said in a company statement. In Europe, PSA's home region as well as its biggest, sales also dropped by 1.9 percent to 1.04 million vehicles, essentially weighed down by a sharp decline for the upscale DS brand, which slumped 45 percent. Iran, however, was a bright spot in the first-half numbers. The resumption of official sales in the country helped PSA more than triple its Middle East and Africa deliveries to 277,971 vehicles.

The maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars, which has agreed to buy Opel from General Motors in a deal closing this year, recorded 1.58 million worldwide vehicle sales in January-June, up from 1.54 million a year earlier.     But PSA's Chinese woes deepened, with sales tumbling another 49 percent to just 152,380 vehicles and the Citroen brand down 63 percent. The prolonged slide has prompted a management and distribution shake-up as well as pledges by Chief Executive Carlos Tavares to rush out more SUVs.  Outside China, where we are restructuring our network, global sales of Citroen are increasing,  brand head Linda Jackson said in a company statement. In Europe, PSA's home region as well as its biggest, sales also dropped by 1.9 percent to 1.04 million vehicles, essentially weighed down by a sharp decline for the upscale DS brand, which slumped 45 percent. Iran, however, was a bright spot in the first-half numbers. The resumption of official sales in the country helped PSA more than triple its Middle East and Africa deliveries to 277,971 vehicles. Excluding that region, PSA's sales were down 11 percent. Reporting by Laurence Frost; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/peugeot-sales-idUSL8N1K40KO"},

Exports from the world's second largest economy rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, while imports expanded 17.2 percent, both beating analysts' expectations, official data showed. While exports benefited from solid demand for electronics and industrial goods, a growing trade surplus, particularly with the United States, may add to trade tensions as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to boost activity in his country's manufacturing sector. An increase in trade between China and nuclear-armed North Korea in the first half of the year could also add to diplomatic pressures between Beijing and Washington. Analysts say economic and political risks could undermine much of the strong trade momentum seen in the first half of this year.  Looking ahead, we expect export growth to slow on uncertainties in external demand due to rising geopolitical risks and the stronger yuan-U.S. dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2017,  Nomura researchers said in a note after the data release. China posted a trade surplus of $42.77 billion in June, slightly above analyst forecasts for a surplus of $42.44 billion and wider than May's $40.81 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected June shipments from the world's largest exporter to have risen 8.7 percent, in line with May's growth. Imports were forecast to have climbed 13.1 percent, easing from the unexpectedly strong 14.8 percent jump in May. The country's demand for imports, particularly for industrial commodities such as iron ore and coal used to feed a construction boom, has remained robust in recent months. This is thanks mostly to resilient real estate demand in smaller Chinese cities with lax property rules as authorities are keen to clear a housing glut. However, analysts say a slowdown in demand for materials from abroad may already be taking place.   Looking ahead, exports should continue to do well given the relatively positive outlook for China's main trading partners,   Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. FILE PHOTO: A man rides his motorcycle past shipping containers at the Port of Shanghai February 14, 2011.Aly Song/File Photo But we are skeptical that the current pace of imports can be sustained for much longer given the increasing headwinds to China's economy from policy tightening.  China's exports denominated in yuan rose 15 percent in January-June from the same period a year earlier, while imports jumped 25.7 percent during the period. Many economists still expect Beijing's intensifying crackdown on unscrupulous lending and a cooling property market to translate to slower growth after a surprisingly solid first quarter. China publishes its second quarter economic growth numbers on Monday. Economics polled by Reuters expect gross domestic product growth to have cooled to 6.8 percent from 6.9 percent in the first quarter as Beijing tightens the screws on financial risks. Authorities have continued their campaign to reduce financial leverage in the economy while also maintaining stability in markets. Heightened Trade Tensions?     China's trade surplus with the United States was $25.4 billion in June, up from $22.0 billion in May, official data showed, and its widest since October 2015, according to a Reuters calculation. While U.S. demand remains robust, concerns of possible trade frictions between the United States and China appear to be back on the radar. Trump has described the trade imbalances between the two countries as a  very, very big issue  that he would address.  Washington is also investigating aluminum imports from China under the rarely used section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that allows restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. The administration is conducting a separate investigation into steel. The world's two biggest economies started their 100 days of trade talks in April and agreed in May to take action by mid-July to increase access for U.S. financial firms and expanding trade in beef and chicken among other steps. Senior U.S. and Chinese officials will hold a U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in Washington on July 19, which will be the first covering economic and trade issues in a new format for U.S.-China dialogue.

The star performer was the Canadian dollar, which rocketed to 11-month highs after the country's central bank hiked rates for the first time in seven years and left the door wide open to further moves. The overall mood was one of relief that Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen had not sounded more hawkish in her appearance before Congress, a green light for risk taking. Sentiment got another boost when China reported upbeat data on exports and imports for June, helping the blue-chip CSI300 index rise 0.7 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.2 percent to its highest since May 2015. South Korea climbed 1.1 percent to a record after its central bank kept policy super easy to support consumer spending. India also scored an all-time top, while Australia's main index jumped 1.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei was restrained by a firmer yen and ended flat. In Europe, futures pointed to a steady start after a strong session the day before. On Wall Street, the Dow had ended Wednesday up 0.57 percent, while the S&P; 500 gained 0.73 percent and the Nasdaq 1.10 percent. The rate-sensitive S&P; 500 real estate index jumped 1.3 percent, its biggest gain in about four months. Equities were underpinned by a drop in bond yields as Yellen sounded cautious on inflation and noted the Fed would not need to raise rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the neutral funds rate.  The market did perceive a greater degree of anxiety over inflation – at the margin,  said Westpac's U.S. economist, Elliot Clarke.  To our mind, this is unlikely to get in the way of another hike this year.   Two further hikes in 2018 will likely be justified by conditions. However, the case for additional hikes thereafter is nowhere near being made.  Indeed, markets doubt even that modest tightening will ensue and imply only a 50-50 chance of a rise by December. Oh Canada Treasuries rallied in reaction, with yields on two-year notes falling to three-week lows, as did bonds in Europe and Asia. The odd man out was Canada, where yields hit their highest since late 2013 after the Bank of Canada raised rates a quarter point saying the economy no longer needed as much stimulus. The Canadian dollar notched its biggest percentage gain since March 2016 and was last trading near one-year peaks at C$1.2740. The main loser was the U.S. dollar which slipped to 112.97 on the yen, while the euro edged up to $1.1451. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was within a whisker of nine-month lows at 95.513. The drop in U.S. yields benefited gold, which pays no interest, and pushed the precious metal up 0.3 percent to $1,223.16 and away from its recent trough of $1,204.45. Oil prices flatlined as producer club OPEC said it expected demand to decline next year as rivals pump more, though the Chinese trade data showed it remained a heavy buyer. Brent crude futures were off 4 cents at $47.70 a barrel, while U.S. crude eased 5 cents to $45.44.

In the superlong zone, the 20-year JGB yield was down 2.5 basis points at 0.600 percent, and the 30-year JGB yield shed 3.5 basis points to 0.855 percent.

The sale drew bids of 4.19 times the amount offered, up from the previous sale's bid-to-cover ratio of 3.98 times. JGBs market sentiment also got a lift from firmer U.S. Treasuries, which rose after Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress tempered investors' expectations for an interest rate hike later this year.

In New York, 45% of attendees said that higher capital standards have been most consequential in creating more resilience in banking. Joo-Yung Lee, Fitch's Head of North American Financial Institutions, commented:  Resolution planning has been one of the most constructive financial regulations from a credit standpoint; it has improved risk governance, particularly risk identification, and has helped banks rationalise their businesses and simplify their organizational structures.  In London, attendees named stress testing requirements marginally ahead of higher capital standards as the most consequential aspect of financial regulation with 34% versus 31% of the votes respectively. In Hong Kong, 50% of participants named higher capital standards. When asked about their greatest concerns regarding EU banks, attendees' views also differed by region with 39% most concerned about earnings in London, 44% choosing asset quality in New York and 46% selecting asset quality in Hong Kong.  For major European banks, we expect a slight improvement in earnings over the medium term, despite margins remaining under pressure from low interest rates. Nonetheless, euro area banks with elevated non-performing loans will continue to face high regulatory scrutiny from the ECB,  said James Longsdon, Co-Head of Fitch's EMEA Financial Institutions team, In Hong Kong, a key topic was how Chinese banks balance growth against stability. Jonathan Cornish, Head of Asia-Pacific Financial Institutions, said:  The majority of market participants believe that China will remain challenged by asset-quality problems, which we understand based on our own scenario analysis, but we also see rapid growth as having contributed to capital and liquidity pressures - especially among mid-tier banks - highlighting their weaker credit profiles relative to the state banks.  Fitch's Global Banking Conference has been running for more than 20 years.  It brings together Fitch's financial institutions analysts from around the world for discussions on the top credit issues impacting the banking industry.

Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

The world's biggest chocolate and cocoa product maker retained its mid-term targets, valid until end-August 2018, of 4-6 percent volume growth and said it expects earnings before interest tax to grow at a faster rate. Global chocolate demand is under pressure as many consumers opt for healthier snacks, but Barry Callebaut has so far bucked the trend by striking deals with food groups that outsource chocolate production and by tapping into the fast-growing  gourmet  business with chefs and pastry makers.  We continue to see a healthy portfolio and expect the good momentum to remain. On this basis we confirm our mid-term guidance,  the company, which supplies food groups such as Nestle and Unilever , said in a statement on Thursday. Sales volumes at the Zurich-based company rose 5.5 percent in the third quarter ended May 31. This was ahead of a Reuters poll that forecast an increase of 4.7 percent. Sales volumes fell 0.4 percent in the first quarter and then edged up 3.5 percent in the second quarter. The company cited its gourmet business, outsourcing and emerging markets as growth drivers, and said sales volume in its cocoa business is back to the year-ago level after the group exited less-profitable contracts. Sales revenue grew 3.7 percent to 5.19 billion Swiss francs ($5.4 billion) in the nine-month period that ended in May, also slightly better than the poll estimate of 5.14 billion Swiss francs. Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said the growth acceleration in the third quarter was good news, but the mid-term guidance implied  more than 6 percent (volume) growth in the coming five quarters, a rather challenging goal without any significant new outsourcing deals . $1 = 0.9634 Swiss francs Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/barry-callebaut-results-idUSL8N1K40FG"},

In the past months, police have staged wider sweeps on workplaces to check papers, netting undocumented workers, sending a warning to employers and sparking heated debate in a nation that has been traditionally tolerant to migrants. In May, police carried out their biggest raid so far when dozens of officers swooped on a constructions site in Stockholm. Nine were caught and sent to detention centers, while another 40 escaped by scrambling onto scaffolding and across roof tops. Swedish authorities had already started to tighten up on illegal immigrants, but police stepped up their activities after Uzbek construction worker Rakhmat Akilov drove into Stockholm shoppers in April.   We have an unlimited amount of work,  said Jerk Wiberg, who leads the Stockholm police unit in charge of domestic border controls. A 22-year veteran who has caught thousands of illegal immigrants, Wiberg led the raid at the construction site in May.  After Akilov became another militant in Europe to use a truck as a weapon, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven made it clear that  no means no  for those whose asylum bids are rejected. Akilov, whose lawyer said he had admitted to committing the crime, had been in hiding after his asylum request was denied.     The Migration Agency estimated 10,000 asylum-seekers a year will choose to disappear rather than be deported. Up to 50,000 undocumented immigrants already work in hotels, transport, construction and restaurants, the agency said last year.  Migration Minister Morgan Johansson said that a  dual labor market ... where a growing group lives on the outside of society and remains in Sweden  after having been denied residency was unacceptable.   It also increases the risk of them being exploited. We cannot have it that way,  he said, adding:  One way is to go after the employers ... (using) expanded workplace checks.   While cheap migrant labor is welcomed by some small businesses, government officials and economists worry that the shadow economy undercuts Sweden's economic model, whose generous welfare provisions and high wages are built on high rates of productivity and one of the world's heaviest tax regimes.     Anti-Immigrant Party Tough measures against immigrants go against the grain for many in Sweden, a country of 10 million which once called itself  a humanitarian superpower  that generously welcomed migrants fleeing conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  But attitudes appear to be changing and a 2017 study by Gothenburg University showed 52 percent favored taking fewer refugees into the country with 24 percent opposed. Two years ago 40 percent backed reducing refugee numbers with 37 opposed. The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats are now the second biggest party in polls with support of around a fifth of Swedes.  The Social Democrats, the country's biggest party in every election since 1917 and leader of the governing coalition with the Greens, has been forced to balance its traditional left-wing credentials with the need to enforce immigration laws. Despite political support for the crackdown and tougher rules on immigration, police struggle to enforce deportations. Between January and April police deported just under 600 people, a third fewer than in the same period last year. Some of those caught were freed because detention centers were full, while others cannot be deported as they don't have passports to prove their country of origin or their home countries refuse to take them.  The government never discloses how many are held in detention centers, saying there are about 360 beds and deportees are normally repatriated within three weeks. The government has told the migration agency to add another 100 beds. An extra 800 million crowns ($95 million) has been added to the police budget this year to bolster the clampdown, but senior officers say this is not enough.      Widening the Net In 2016, police made about 1,100 unannounced workplace checks, almost three times more than in 2015, and caught 232 illegal immigrants. A further increase is expected in 2017 as the net widens. Illegal immigrants are also detained through checks at transport hubs, on vehicles or after committing crime. Deportations made up a small fraction of the 20,000 rejected asylum seekers who left Sweden last year.  We have been able to increase the number of people who leave Sweden substantially. But we're listening to the police and we have paved the way for more resources and wider powers,  Johansson said in an interview, adding:   We will have to increase that number further.  Expanded police powers include workplace checks without concrete suspicion of a crime, to be allowed from next year, with sharply higher fines for employing illegal immigrants.   Immigrants themselves have been unnerved. When police burst into a pizzeria in the southern city of Malmo where Ehsanulla Kajfar, a 38-year-old Afghan refugee, was working in May he said he thought they were looking for  terrorists or drug dealers .  He was surprised to be handcuffed and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle as tax officials scrutinized the restaurant's employee ledger. He was told his papers were not in order and was taken to a detention center.   Sweden used to be a nice country, even when I was living underground,  he told Reuters.  Now although I have a residence permit from Italy and I am registered at the tax agency in Sweden, I'm still locked in a detention center.    Immigrants Fearful Nicaraguan Hugo Eduardo Somarriba Quintero, 37, said he was wrongly detained in the big raid in Stockholm in May due to an error by authorities and then released. Migration Agency records confirmed the details of his case.    But I've lost my job – the company where I was working was dropped from the construction site (because of irregularities in not checking work papers properly). Now I am looking for work and there is no job for me,  he tearfully told Reuters, adding:  Before there was a lot of tolerance for migrants. Now the laws are harder.   Muhammad, a 22-year old Afghan who declined to give his family name, has been in hiding for three years in Malmo since his asylum application was rejected. He has moved three times this year and never stays in a place longer than three months. All his belongings are packed in a suitcase and two plastic bags if he needs to leave in a hurry. Muhammad relies on food stamps from the church and leftover food from restaurants and grocery stores.  He has learned to avoid the city center when there is an increase in policing and gets help from other immigrants and volunteers who work for asylum-seekers' rights. They warn each other of police checks and raids through text messages.   Last time the police made a push to find immigrants, my friend stayed inside for 15 to 20 days,  Muhammad said.  But I can't stay inside all the time, its too depressing.

In the past months, police have staged wider sweeps on workplaces to check papers, netting undocumented workers, sending a warning to employers and sparking heated debate in a nation that has been traditionally tolerant to migrants. In May, police carried out their biggest raid so far when dozens of officers swooped on a constructions site in Stockholm. Nine were caught and sent to detention centers, while another 40 escaped by scrambling onto scaffolding and across roof tops. Swedish authorities had already started to tighten up on illegal immigrants, but police stepped up their activities after Uzbek construction worker Rakhmat Akilov drove into Stockholm shoppers in April.   We have an unlimited amount of work,  said Jerk Wiberg, who leads the Stockholm police unit in charge of domestic border controls. A 22-year veteran who has caught thousands of illegal immigrants, Wiberg led the raid at the construction site in May.  After Akilov became another militant in Europe to use a truck as a weapon, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven made it clear that  no means no  for those whose asylum bids are rejected. Akilov, whose lawyer said he had admitted to committing the crime, had been in hiding after his asylum request was denied.     The Migration Agency estimated 10,000 asylum-seekers a year will choose to disappear rather than be deported. Up to 50,000 undocumented immigrants already work in hotels, transport, construction and restaurants, the agency said last year.  Migration Minister Morgan Johansson said that a  dual labor market ... where a growing group lives on the outside of society and remains in Sweden  after having been denied residency was unacceptable.   It also increases the risk of them being exploited. We cannot have it that way,  he said, adding:  One way is to go after the employers ... (using) expanded workplace checks.   While cheap migrant labor is welcomed by some small businesses, government officials and economists worry that the shadow economy undercuts Sweden's economic model, whose generous welfare provisions and high wages are built on high rates of productivity and one of the world's heaviest tax regimes.     Anti-Immigrant Party Tough measures against immigrants go against the grain for many in Sweden, a country of 10 million which once called itself  a humanitarian superpower  that generously welcomed migrants fleeing conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  But attitudes appear to be changing and a 2017 study by Gothenburg University showed 52 percent favored taking fewer refugees into the country with 24 percent opposed. Two years ago 40 percent backed reducing refugee numbers with 37 opposed. The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats are now the second biggest party in polls with support of around a fifth of Swedes.  The Social Democrats, the country's biggest party in every election since 1917 and leader of the governing coalition with the Greens, has been forced to balance its traditional left-wing credentials with the need to enforce immigration laws. Despite political support for the crackdown and tougher rules on immigration, police struggle to enforce deportations. Between January and April police deported just under 600 people, a third fewer than in the same period last year. Some of those caught were freed because detention centers were full, while others cannot be deported as they don't have passports to prove their country of origin or their home countries refuse to take them.  The government never discloses how many are held in detention centers, saying there are about 360 beds and deportees are normally repatriated within three weeks. The government has told the migration agency to add another 100 beds. An extra 800 million crowns ($95 million) has been added to the police budget this year to bolster the clampdown, but senior officers say this is not enough.      Widening the Net In 2016, police made about 1,100 unannounced workplace checks, almost three times more than in 2015, and caught 232 illegal immigrants. A further increase is expected in 2017 as the net widens. Illegal immigrants are also detained through checks at transport hubs, on vehicles or after committing crime. Deportations made up a small fraction of the 20,000 rejected asylum seekers who left Sweden last year.  We have been able to increase the number of people who leave Sweden substantially. But we're listening to the police and we have paved the way for more resources and wider powers,  Johansson said in an interview, adding:   We will have to increase that number further.  Expanded police powers include workplace checks without concrete suspicion of a crime, to be allowed from next year, with sharply higher fines for employing illegal immigrants.   Immigrants themselves have been unnerved. When police burst into a pizzeria in the southern city of Malmo where Ehsanulla Kajfar, a 38-year-old Afghan refugee, was working in May he said he thought they were looking for  terrorists or drug dealers .  He was surprised to be handcuffed and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle as tax officials scrutinized the restaurant's employee ledger.

The Outlook is Negative. Fitch has also downgraded the rating on GCX Limited's USD350 million 7% senior secured notes due 2019 to 'B+' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR2' from 'BB+/RR1'. GCX Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of GCX. The notes are secured by the assets and equity interests of GCX and its key subsidiaries and are guaranteed by GCX and its key operating subsidiaries, which generate most of group's revenue and EBITDA. The downgrades reflect our expectations that GCX's liquidity could weaken significantly in the financial year ending March 2018 (FY18). GCX's cash balance could deplete to below USD40 million in FY18 (FY17: USD62 million) due to lower indefeasible right of usage (IRU) sales, weakness at its managed service segment and working capital outflows. We forecast FFO-adjusted net leverage to deteriorate to over 5.0x in FY18 (FY17: 4.2x). The 'RR2' Recovery Rating indicates superior recoveries on the senior secured notes in a default scenario - between 71%-90% - based on our prudent estimate of value that would be available to creditors. The Negative Outlook reflects near-term risks to the credit profile, in particular the risk of persistently negative FCF, deteriorating liquidity, and therefore higher refinancing risk of the bond due in August 2019. A revision of the Outlook to Stable would be contingent upon an improvement in GCX's cash generation due to high IRU sales or improvement in receivable collections such that FCF breaks even. In case GCX's IDR is downgraded to 'CCC', the bond rating will be downgraded by two notches to 'B-' as instruments cannot be rated 'CCC+' under Fitch's criteria. KEY RATING DRIVERS Depleting Cash Balance: We expect GCX's cash balance in FY18 to drop below USD40 million, the minimum it needs to meet financial and operational commitments. It needs a minimum cash balance of USD40 million-50 million to meet its interest expense of USD25 million, maintenance capex of USD22 million and taxes of USD3 million. Cash EBITDA could decline to around USD70 million (FY17: USD78 million) due to lower IRU sales of around USD50 million (FY17: USD51 million) and weakness at its managed service segment. FCF Deficit: Fitch forecasts GCX to have negative FCF of USD30 million-35 million in FY18, as cash flow from operations may fall short of our capex estimate of around USD30 million and dividend payments of USD15 million. GCX paid USD15 million in dividends in FY17. Capex includes maintenance expenditure of USD22 million and USD6 million-8 million to invest in its Indian enterprise business and expand landing stations. Management does not intend to pay any dividends and make any capex for the Indian enterprise business in FY18. Higher Counterparty Risk: GCX's faces higher counterparty risk due to uncertainty over collection of receivables, mainly from its parent Reliance Communications Limited (Rcom; RD), with which it has about USD30million-35 million worth of trading relationship in FY18-19. We assess GCX's IDR based on its standalone profile under our Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria, due to weak legal, operational and strategic linkages with its parent. We understand that Rcom may be looking to sell all or part of its stake in GCX. GCX's cash flows are ring-fenced and dividends to Rcom are subject to an incurrence test of debt/EBITDA of below 3.75x (FY17: 3.0x) and restricted payment covenants.  However, GCX is allowed to pay about USD10million-15 million in dividends annually under the ring-fencing conditions. Enterprise Venture is Credit Negative: We believe that GCX's entry into the enterprise telecommunications market in India is negative for its credit profile as we expect minimal additional FCF during FY18-19. Rcom will assign GCX enterprise assets, including an intra-city fibre network, worth USD90 million to partly pay its USD94 million of receivables due to GCX at end-March 2017. GCX is still waiting to obtain unified telecom licence approval from the Indian telecom regulator. Chronic Industry Over-Capacity: EBITDA remain vulnerable to chronic industry over-capacity, which has resulted from bandwidth increases from new submarine cables added by  over-the-top  operators and telecommunication companies. Also, technological advancements continue to improve the capacity of existing cables. Hence, bandwidth tariffs will continue declining over the medium term despite increased demand. Recovery Rating of 'RR2': The rating on GCX Limited's senior secured guaranteed bond is now two notches higher than the IDR. We use the going-concern value approach to calculate the post-restructuring enterprise value as the liquidation approach is not appropriate given GCX's under-sea cable assets are of little use if liquidated. We estimate post-restructuring cash flow to be around USD74 million - the same as at our last review - which assumes depletion of the current business position to reflects the distress that provoked a default, and a level of corrective action that would have occurred during restructuring. We have assumed a lower cash flow multiple of 4.5x instead of earlier 5.0x as we believe that Rcom may settle for lower value for GCX given the parent's weak liquidity and cash requirements. The adjusted going-concern enterprise value after administrative claims of USD300 million is then applied to USD380 million owed to creditors, comprising an undrawn revolving credit facility of USD30 million and USD350 million of secured notes. DERIVATION SUMMARY GCX is smaller and has a weaker market position than US-based Level 3 Communications, Inc. (LVLT, BB/Stable). LVLT, with its strong position in the US enterprise market and solid network capabilities, generates FCF of over USD1 billion compared with the consistently negative FCF for GCX. LVLT is committed to deleverage to the low end of its net leverage target of between 3.0x and 4.0x, while we expect GCX's leverage to worsen to over 5.0x in FY18. GCX's ratings reflect its worsening liquidity profile due to weaker cash generation. GCX also has a weaker business risk profile because its cash generation is exposed to lumpy IRU sales. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue to remain flat in FY18 - Fitch's calculated cash EBITDA of around USD70 million-75 million with IRU sales of USD50 million - Working capital outflow of USD30 million-35 million during FY18 - Dividends of USD15 million to Rcom in FY18 - Annual capex of around USD30 million - Recovery analysis used a going-concern value approach with post-restructuring EBITDA of USD74 million and cash flow multiple of 4.5x. - 10% administrative claims are applied on the going-concern value. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or collectively, lead to the Outlook reverting to Stable - An improvement in GCX's cash generation and receivable collection such that FCF breaks even. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Deterioration of liquidity evidenced by cash balance falling below USD40 million. - FFO-adjusted net leverage deteriorates to above 6.0x (FY18 forecast: above 5.0x) LIQUIDITY Deteriorating Liquidity: We expect GCX's unrestricted cash balance to deplete to below the minimum critical level of USD40 million (FY17: USD62 million) in FY18. Its only debt is the USD350 million secured note due in 2019. GCX has committed undrawn facilities of USD30 million, of which USD10 million was drawn in March 2017 but was paid back in May 2017. Its ability to access additional debt is limited due to an incurrence covenant in its bond indenture that limits debt/EBITDA to 3.75x.

The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six major rivals, was down 0.2 percent to 95.609 at 0506 GMT.     Yellen said on Wednesday the U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise rates, though low inflation and a low neutral rate may leave the central bank with diminished leeway.       Some may argue that her remarks overnight were dovish, but we argue that they are rather balanced to some extent,  said Christopher Wong, senior FX strategist for Maybank.     The Philippine peso gained 0.2 percent, recovering a little from fresh eleven year lows it had hit this week, partly due to a widening goods trade deficit.     The Taiwan dollar rose as much as 0.6 percent, posting its biggest intraday percentage gain in three months, while the Indonesian rupiah tacked on 0.3 percent, its biggest intraday percentage gain since April 25.     The Indian rupee was up 0.2 percent, it highest in more than three weeks on rising expectations of an interest rate increase.     Inflation data out on Wednesday showing benign price pressures left the door open for a 25-basis-point cut by the Reserve Bank of India.        The next focus for markets will be Yellen's testimony to the Senate Banking Panel and U.S. inflation data on Friday.             CHINESE YUAN      The Chinese yuan rose 0.2 percent, reflecting a broadly weaker dollar and a higher mid-point set by the People's Bank of China.      There was muted reaction to solid Chinese trade numbers  released earlier in the day, although the data reinforced a growing view that the world's second-biggest economy is holding its own even though the outlook has dimmed somewhat on the back of Beijing's crackdown on debt risks.       SOUTH KOREAN WON     The won gained the most in the region, up 0.8 percent, its highest in more than two weeks.     South Korea's central bank held its policy rate at a record-low 1.25 percent for a 13th straight month on Thursday, a widely expected decision as policy makers seek to boost subdued private consumption and keep any thoughts of tightening off the table for now.     Stephen Innes, senior trader from Oanda sees this as good sign as  it will keep the equity markets in a pretty good mood. A rate hike could have tampered equity markets as much of the inflow in South Korea has been predicated on the back of low equity valuations.      The benchmark South Korea stock index was up 1.2 percent.

Murray's hopes of becoming the first Briton to retain a grand slam title since Fred Perry in 1936 were shredded as he hobbled helplessly to a 3-6 6-4 6-7(4) 6-1 6-1 defeat. While Murray said his hip injury was not to blame for his exit, three-time Wimbledon champion Becker told the BBC the Briton's movement was clearly affected.  He has got to think long term, not worry about making the U.S. Open - if he is moving there like he did at Wimbledon, then he won't win it anyway,  the German said.  His ranking should not be a concern either. Again, he will not defend it if he is not healthy, so he should just forget it. He has been there and done it and he does not have to prove anything anymore that he is good enough to be number one.  Becker said he understood why Murray would have played at Wimbledon even if he was not 100 percent fit. Tennis - French Open Men's Singles Quarterfinal match - Roland Garros - Novak Djokovic of Serbia vs Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic - Paris, France - 02/06/16. Novak Djokovics trainer Boris Becker.Benoit Tessie I understand why Andy played Wimbledon, because it is his number one tournament every year, and he was also the defending champion. He was desperate to make it work,  added Becker, who won six grand slam titles.  I was always the same. In hindsight, I should not have played some of my matches but, in the heat of the moment, I always wanted to play the next round or the next event... But you run the risk of doing yourself more serious damage if you play on. Becker said Murray should take some time to evaluate his fitness.  Andy is now at the point where he needs to be really honest with himself because if he can't run, he can't play.  I credit him for not wanting to use the hip injury as an excuse for his defeat but he needs to get a couple of opinions from doctors before he thinks about coming back.

The military quarters where the blaze broke out were on the highway between Kilis and the region's largest city, Gaziantep.

The maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars said on Thursday it had recorded 1.58 million sales globally in January-June, up from 1.54 million a year earlier. But PSA's Chinese woes continued, with sales plunging by another 49 percent to just 152,380 vehicles in the period. The year-long slide has prompted a management and distribution shake-up in the region, as well as pledges by Chief Executive Carlos Tavares to rush out more SUVs. In Europe, PSA's home region as well as its biggest, sales also dropped by 1.9 percent to 1.04 million vehicles, essentially weighed down by a sharp decline in upscale DS brand sales, which slumped 45 percent. Iran, however, was a bright spot in the first-half numbers. The resumption of consolidated sales in the country helped PSA more than triple its Middle East and Africa sales to 277,971 vehicles.

Oil prices, which generally affect sentiment in the Gulf region, were also relatively stable, with Brent crude futures rising 1 cent to $47.75 a barrel, while U.S. crude was unchanged at $45.49. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.2 percent to its highest since May 2015, as Yellen sounded cautious on inflation and noted on Wednesday the Fed would not need to raise rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the neutral funds rate. With second-quarter earnings of Gulf companies in focus, investors are likely to analyse the health of the region's banking sector. Abu Dhabi-based Union National Bank on Wednesday said its second-quarter net profit rose almost 7 percent, beating analysts' forecast. However, Oman's biggest lender, Bank Muscat, posted a 14 percent decline in second-quarter net profit from a year earlier, according Reuters calculation, missing market expectations. The bank initially released its first-half figures, which showed a 6.8 percent decline from a year earlier, affected by a drop in non-interest income.

Former Chicago Alderman Edwin Eisendrath and the group of investors beat out Tronc Inc., the owner of the Chicago Tribune as well as the Los Angeles Times and Baltimore Sun, for the tabloid, the Chicago newspapers reported on Wednesday.  It's a great town as you know and it will continue to have two great newspapers,  Eisendrath said on Twitter in announcing the deal. The U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division opened an investigation in May into the possible sale of the Sun-Times to Tronc and monitored the bidding closely. The department said in a statement on Wednesday that it closed its investigation with the paper's sale to ST Acquisition Holdings LLC, the investor group. The terms of the deal between ST Acquisition Holdings and Sun-Times parent Wrapports LLC were not made public. Corporate restructuring expert William Brandt, the Chicago Federation of Labor, local labor unions and about a half-dozen other individuals make up the investor group, the Sun-Times reported. Labor unions in the city applauded the sale, which also included the Chicago Reader, a weekly.  The little guy won here,  said Chicago Federation of Labor President Jorge Ramirez to the Sun-Times.  This is about fair, honest and balanced reporting. The Sun-Times has a rich history of that.  Wrapports has an annual $25 million contract with Tronc to print and distribute the Sun-Times. The contract is a major source of revenue for Tronc and one of the reasons it wanted to purchase the newspaper, the Sun-Times reported.

Sentiment toward the Chinese yuan and the Malaysian ringgit improved further, however, with long positions in both currencies touching their largest in a month.  Treasuries and benchmark European bond yields resumed their march upwards, having paused on Monday, as the focus shifted back to the pace of monetary tightening in the world's largest economies.  Investors were estimated to have trimmed their bullish bets on most emerging Asian currencies, according to the poll of 17 analysts, traders and fund managers. Bearish positions in the Philippine peso increased to their largest since late March after the peso hit its lowest since 2006 on Tuesday as data showed the Philippines posted its widest trade deficit in decades in May.  The Philippines had a trade deficit of $2.753 billion in May, wider than the $2.24 billion gap in the same month last year. Bets on the Taiwan dollar took a bearish turn for the first time since January.  The poll was conducted between Tuesday and Wednesday.  All of the responses came before Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's two-day Congressional address, even as the world's top bonds and emerging market currencies were under pressure on bets for higher interest rates in a small but growing group of major economies. In remarks to the House Committee on Financial Services, Yellen said the U.S. economy is strong enough to absorb further gradual rate increases along with the slow wind-down of the Fed's massive bond portfolio. The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht. The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

China's blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.5 percent, to 3,676.07 points by the lunch break, on track to close at a 1-1/2-year high. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.4 percent, to 3,211.51 points. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index jumped 1.1 percent, to 26,323.33 points - a fresh two-year-high, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index gained 1.5 percent, to 10,678.43. But start-ups in both markets underperformed. China's small-cap board ChiNext lost 0.2 percent while Hong Kong's Growth Enterprise Market was roughly flat. The market was inspired by better-than-expected China trade data for June. Exports rose 11.3 percent last month from a year earlier, while imports expanded 17.2 percent, suggesting the economy is holding up well thanks to firmer global demand.  Today's upbeat figures point to still strong foreign demand for Chinese goods, as well as fairly resilient domestic demand,  said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics.  Looking ahead, exports should continue to do well given the relatively positive outlook for China's main trading partners.  Risk appetite also improved after Wall Street hit record peaks as investors wagered policy tightening in the United States would be glacial at best. Chinese investors continued to plow money into blue chips, helping lift sectors such as banking, raw materials and infrastructure.  Mainland investors are increasingly ditching speculative trading, and putting money in those companies that generate predictable incomes,  said Wu Wei, analyst at Zheshang Securities Co.

The Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee held its base rate KROCRT=ECI steady, a media official said without elaborating. Governor Lee Ju-yeol is due to hold a news conference from 11:20 a.m. (0220 GMT) All 20 economists surveyed in a Reuters poll had forecast the central bank would stand pat, noting that weak private consumption and tepid job growth are taking some of the shine off steady gains in exports. A majority of analysts see the central bank on hold for the rest of this year, and expect any move to normalize rates to happen next year.  The BOK will release quarterly revisions to its economic forecasts later in the day.   It would be difficult to raise rates in the second half but raising it in the first half of 2018 would be unavoidable,  said Oh Chang-sob, fixed-income strategist, Korea Investment and Securities, noting that higher U.S. interest rates raises the risk capital outflows from South Korea. Markets shrugged off the policy decision, with the won KRW= and stocks .KS11 up slightly and futures on three-year treasury bonds KTBc1 rising 0.02 points to trade at 109.17. After five years of accommodative policy, most analysts expect the BOK to take a hawkish turn next year in a more gradual approach to exiting low rates than some of its counterparts in Europe and Canada.   Indeed, while exports grew at a double-digit rate for the sixth month in a row in June, lukewarm jobs growth and subdued  private consumption argue against a rush to tighten rates. South Korea's consumer price inflation has cooled from the peak of 2.2 percent in March to 1.9 percent in June, slightly below the BOK's target of 2 percent. It's too early for the BOK to join global counterparts in talking up policy tightening, said Kim Yu-mi, an economist at Kiwoom Securities.   The BOK needs to confirm soaring exports leads to stronger domestic demand before it can rise interest rates,  Kim said before the rate decision.  The Federal Reserve has already raised rates twice this year and is expected to tighten again before year-end, while the European Central Bank is preparing markets for tapering its massive stimulus possibly as early as 2018.

Exports of steel products fell 2.4 percent to 6.81 million tonnes from the previous month, according to Reuters calculations based on the data. China, the world's largest aluminium producer, exported 460,000 million tonnes of unwrought aluminium and aluminium products in June, in line with the previous month, according to the data.  Tight (steel) supply and strong prices in the domestic market have enticed mills and traders to focus more at home. Foreign traders are less willing to buy steel from China as the price advantage is less obvious,  said Wang Yilin, steel analyst at Sinosteel Futures. The numbers come amid a trade dispute with the United States, which says China has flooded international markets with cheap aluminium and steel. In April, Beijing and Washington agreed to a 100-day plan for trade talks in a bid to boost access to each other's markets.  We don't think the 100-day plan between China had much impact on steel exports in June, since the U.S. only takes a very small part among China's total exports,  said Wang at Sinosteel Futures. China has eliminated about 120 million tonnes of low-quality steel capacity in the first half of this year in a bid to tackle a supply glut and fight pollution. Steel prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange have gained almost 36 percent so far in 2017. Total inventories of rebar SH-TOT-RBARINV remain down after falling to their lowest in six months in early June.

China imported 2.23 million tonnes of copper in the first half of this year, down 18.4 percent compared to same period last year, official data showed on Thursday. For the first five months of the year, China imported 1.840 tonnes of copper. June's monthly figures were also down by 7 percent on the 420,000 tonnes in the same month of last year. China has imported less refined copper this year amid tough restrictions on dollar-denominated credit, and as buyers turned instead to cheaper scrap metal after a recovery in copper prices prompted a flood of scrap into the market earlier this year. Copper prices scaled one-year highs above $6,200 a tonne in February, up 30 percent from late October lows.  It is slightly better than my expectations,  said analyst Chris Wu of CRU in Beijing. Wu said that China did not import a lot of cathodes in the first four months due to restrictions getting dollar-denominated credit lines, but that improved prospects for credit could improve copper imports in the coming month.  For July I think it should continue to improve. I have heard from traders there is some appetite for dollar cathodes for end of July so I would think that July imports will be slightly better because state companies have access to the second half of this year's credit.  China's copper concentrate imports stood at 1.41 million tonnes, recovering by 23 percent from May's depressed levels when mining outages crimped supplies to the world's top metals consumer and producer. The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 3 percent in June, its biggest monthly gain since March as global exchange stocks fell, fuelling supply concerns. But in the months ahead, broad industry sentiment is pointing to slackening demand at home and abroad, as authorities in China move to tackle property market risks and credit growth, though they are treading cautiously to avoid hurting the economy.

The Spanish royals will stay at Buckingham Palace during a  visit that was twice postponed - once because of a political crisis in Spain in 2016 and then after it clashed with an early election Prime Minister Theresa May called in June. Slideshow (15 Images)Agreed before Britain voted to leave the European Union in June last year, the three-day Spanish state visit, the first in 31 years, now takes place just months after a long-running row over Gibraltar, the  Rock  captured by Britain in 1704 which Spain wants back, flared up again. The EU and Britain have also yet to agree on guarantees for EU citizens living in Britain and British expats living in other EU countries. More than 300,000 Britons live in Spain.  The Spanish royals will have a private lunch at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday with Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, afternoon tea at the Prince of Wales' London residence Clarence House and a state banquet. Felipe, who used a speech to the United Nations to invite Britain  to end the colonial anachronism of Gibraltar , will also address both houses of parliament on Wednesday and meet May at her Downing Street office on Thursday. The future of Gibraltar, with a population of 30,000, is set to be a major point of contention in the Brexit talks. The EU annoyed Britain and Gibraltar in April by suggesting Spain have a right of veto over the territory's post-Brexit relationship with the bloc.

Monterrey-based Jaguar Exploracion y Produccion de Hidrocarburos took a stake in over half the areas awarded, which the oil industry regulator said would eventually yield around $2 billion in investments over the 30-year lifespan of the contracts. A tie-up of Canada's Sun God Energia and Jaguar won six out of 10 areas available in the first of two tenders on Wednesday, the sixth and seventh auctions since a 2013-14 energy reform. There were no bidders for three of the areas. Bidding alone, Jaguar also scooped up another five areas in the second tender of 14 blocks, all of which were auctioned. Sun God Resources is based in Calgary, Alberta, while Jaguar is a Monterrey-based firm whose chief executive is Dionisio Garza, a well-known Mexican businessman. A consortium made up of Iberoamericana de Hidrocarburos Servicios and PJP4 de Mexico won one block in the initial auction and two in the second for a total of three. The second auction also saw a fresh push into Mexico by Asian investors, with a consortium of China's Shandong Kerui Oilfield Service Group with Mexico's Sicoval MX and Nuevas Soluciones Energeticas A&P; securing three areas. Slim's Carso Oil and Gas claimed two of the areas in the second tender, which saw a number of fields won by cash offers after more than one company made the maximum possible bid. Newpek, a unit of Mexican conglomerate Alfa, teamed up with U.S. firm Verdad Exploration Mexico to win two areas. The auctions are part of a constitutional reform to open up production and exploration to private investors with the aim of reversing a steady decline in oil output since 2004 and boosting anemic economic growth. The reform is starting to bear fruit. Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the oil regulator known as the CNH, told a news conference that including the $2 billion he expected the new contracts to generate eventually, the reform had now secured projected investments of around $60 billion. The 21 areas should yield an extra 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) in crude production by 2025 as well as 378 million cubic feet per day of additional natural gas output, Zepeda said. That production should start coming online in 2019, he added. Deputy energy minister Aldo Flores forecast the new blocks would generate about 20,500 jobs in the next seven years. Earlier, Britain's Premier Oil said it had found potentially more than 1 billion barrels of oil off the coast of Mexico in the first shallow-water offshore well drilled by the private sector in the country since the reform. The areas on offer on Wednesday were discovered by state oil company Pemex, but have been stymied by underinvestment as the former monopoly focuses on mostly shallow and less-costly water oil and gas fields. They range from areas rich in natural gas in the Burgos basin in northern Mexico to fields that hold promise further south in the Gulf states of Veracruz and Tabasco. Winners are determined based on a weighted formula that takes into account an additional royalty offered to the government as well as an extra investment commitment in the exploration phase of each 30-year contract.

Existing investors including funds Breyer Capital, Goodwater Capital and Valar Ventures, the venture capital firm of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, also participated in the new round, Stash said on Thursday. Stash has developed a mobile app that seeks to make it easier for low-income consumers in the United States to start saving and investing. Starting with as little as $5, users can pick from a batch of over 30 exchange-traded-funds curated by the company's investment team. The app, which charges $1 per month for accounts under $5,000, also offers the option to set automatic investments to help users grow their  stash  over time. It charges a 0.25 percent annual fee for accounts over $5,000. Stash is among a growing cohort of tech-savvy investment managers taking advantage of automation and digital technologies to service consumers usually overlooked by the mainstream wealth management industry.  We help people who don't have a lot save money on a weekly basis,  Brandon Krieg, chief executive and co-founder of Stash, said in an interview.  Stashers look like America, they look like people you meet every day: they are nurses and teachers and Uber and Lyft drivers.  Stash services 850,000 accounts, having added over half a million investors on its platform since the start of the year alone. Around 86 percent of its users are first-time investors, it said. Stash's monthly subscription model for smaller accounts sets it apart from more established online wealth management startups known as robo-advisors, who typically only charge fees based on assets under management. This makes the company's revenue stream less reliant on quickly growing the amount of money their clients invest through their platform, Krieg said. Robo-advisors, however, will not generally allow their customers to pick the ETFs they invest in but use computer algorithms to create and manage portfolios based on their risk profile. Stash, which has raised $78 million in less than two years, will use the latest injection of cash to enhance its technology, expand its team and launch new products, it said, including a new platform for simplified retirement saving.
