Or lack of it. The Detroit Tigers ace gave up hits to the first five batters he faced Tuesday but he didn't feel like he was making bad pitches.  The first two guys hit the ball decent and then after that, what are you supposed to do?  he said.  Probably three of the worst-hit balls you can have in a row go for hits.  Kansas City scored three runs during that span but Verlander managed to shrug it off and stifle the Royals' offense from that point. He recorded his first victory since May 20 as the Tigers won the opener of a 10-game homestand 5-3 at Comerica Park. Verlander, who struck out six while matching a season high by going seven innings, had a loss and five no-decisions in his previous six outings. Justin Wilson recorded his seventh save, striking out two of the three batters he faced. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at Tigers I wasn't happy coming out of the inning but I was happy to keep the damage to a minimum,  Verlander said.  I just reset and said, 'OK, just keep making your pitches and hopefully keep your guys in the game and we can score a few runs.'  Miguel Cabrera delivered the biggest blow, a three-run homer. Cabrera, moved into the cleanup spot for the first time this season, hit his ninth home run of the season in the third inning and it proved to be the game-winner. J.D. Martinez added a solo homer and reached base three times for Detroit. Mikie Mahtook added two hits and a run scored for the Tigers (34-42), who won their second straight following an eight-game losing streak. Salvador Perez drove in two runs for the Royals (37-38). Starter Matt Strahm (2-5) lasted only 3 2/3 innings, allowing five runs on six hits. Whit Merrifield led off the first with a ground-rule double and scored on Jorge Bonifacio's single. The next three batters also singled, capped by Perez's bloop that plated two runs.  If you're going to get to Verlander, you better get him early,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  Tonight's another good example of it. We put three on the board and had a chance to tack on a couple more. But then he just got settled down. We got his pitch count way up in the first two innings and he ends up going seven.  The Tigers got one of those runs back in the second on Martinez's leadoff homer to left. Detroit moved ahead with Cabrera's two-out, three-run blast to right field in the third.  The pitch Cabrera hit for the three-run homer wasn't a horrible pitch,  Yost said.  It was on the corner, elevated a little bit, but he's such a strong guy he just poked it the other way.  Ian Kinsler's two-out RBI single in the fourth gave the Tigers a 5-3 advantage. Mahtook made a spectacular defensive play in center to rob Perez of an extra-base hit in the fifth. Mahtook chased the long fly to deep right-center and made a leaping grab while crashing into the wall. Perez tipped his helmet in Mahtook's direction and he shared a hug with Verlander on the way back to the dugout.  What was hurting? Every bone in my back and my body cracked,  Mahtook said.  At that point, I was just trying to get air back in my lungs. Just had to realize, 'OK, I'm alright, I'm good.' J.D. didn't even ask if I was OK. He said, 'Hey, that's probably going to be on SportsCenter tonight.' I was like, 'Well yeah, I'm good. Thanks for asking.'  NOTES: Tigers DH Victor Martinez is expected to be activated Wednesday. Martinez was placed on the 10-day disabled list June 16th with an irregular heartbeat. Martinez is batting .261 with five homers and 29 RBIs.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index was up 0.3 percent or 19.7 points to 5,733.90 at 0321 GMT. The benchmark has risen 0.2 percent this month. Higher commodity prices helped the materials and the energy sectors as the U.S. dollar took a significant backwards step on Tuesday after the euro gained, said Ben Le Brun, a market analyst at OptionsXpress. The euro rose to a 10-month high after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signalled it will reduce stimulus later this year. Among commodities, oil rose for the fourth consecutive session on Tuesday while gold bounced back from a six-week low. Chinese iron ore prices surged 6 percent to one-month highs on Tuesday in a late burst of short covering and fresh buying that lifted steel and raw materials. Australia's metals and mining index rose as much as 1.5 percent to a two-week high, on track to extend gains into a fifth session. Anglo-Australian miners BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd gained 1.8 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. South32 Ltd rose 4 percent and Fortescue Metals Group climbed 3.9 percent.

The quarterly survey of thousands of Chinese firms by China Beige Book International (CBB) showed that while the property sector slowed, manufacturing improved further and the retail and services industries bounced back after a difficult first quarter. That reinforced a flurry of recent data and policy makers' comments that indicated authorities were working to curb financial risks and keep the economy on an even keel heading into a key political meeting this year.  The survey showed surprisingly strong performance in the commodities sector despite some price weakness in the second quarter, with the aluminium sector particularly strong.  The improving economy, especially the healthy labour market, is no doubt welcome news ahead of a leadership revamp at an autumn congress of the ruling Communist Party of China.  Yet signs of stress in the corporate sector pointed to a bumpy ride for businesses. CBB said cash flow was negative for many companies and inventory levels in the second quarter was at the highest in the history of the survey.  A delivery vehicle of the logistical company ZTO drives past a construction site of residential highrises in Beijing, China June 27, 2017.Thomas PeterThat is in line with official data showing growth in industrial inventories picked up to over 10 percent in April, sparking worries of weak demand. CBB said there are signs tougher times could be ahead for Chinese companies during a period of deleveraging and rising interest rates.   It remains true that either rates have to come plunging back down, as the (state planner) recently called for, or the present level of corporate activity is headed for a cliff,  CBB said in its report.   As the government stepped up its campaign to curb debt risks and stabilise the financial sector, growth of China's broad money supply came in at the slowest in at least two decades in May, though bank lending remained solid. The CBB survey showed the corporate sector started to feel the effect of tighter credit conditions in the second quarter after escaping relatively unscathed in the first three months of the year, with the cost to take a bank loan the highest since 2014.  But borrowing was not impacted much, CBB said, likely due to firms' positive business outlook for the next six months, though CBB said that this may not last if tightening persists.   Companies assume deleveraging is transient, likely because they are skeptical the Party will allow economic pain in 2017. It will not be until 2018 when we find out whether deleveraging is genuine—because it won't be until 2018 that it will actually hurt , CBB said.

On Tuesday night, he got happier. Yelich went 3-for-4 with two RBIs to lead the Miami Marlins to a 6-3 victory over the New York Mets at Marlins Park.  I haven't been playing the way I'm capable of,  said Yelich, whose .735 OPS pales in comparison to his .859 figure from last year.  It's one of those years so far, man, but it's far from over. We still have a long way to go. I just have to keep plugging.  Yelich contributed to the seventh-inning rally that won the game for the Marlins (35-40). It all started with a leadoff walk by J.T. Realmuto against reliever Neil Ramirez (0-1). JT Riddle hit a grounder that deflected off the glove of first baseman Lucas Duda -- it was ruled a hit but could've been an error -- and that put runners on the corners. Lefty-swinging pinch-hitter Ichiro Suzuki singled off lefty reliever Jerry Blevins to put Miami up 4-3. Suzuki leads the majors this year with 12 pinch hits. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at MarlinsMiami Marlins - PlayerWatch He's pretty good at it,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Suzuki's pinch-hitting ability.  The thing with 'Ich' is that he's always ready. You don't have to worry. He is totally prepared for all situations.  After Suzuki's hit, Yelich followed one out later with his two-run single. It was the sixth time this season that Yelich has had a three-hit game, and three of them have come this month. New York (34-42) had its three-game winning streak snapped. Mets starter Robert Gsellman lasted only three innings after he suffered a left hamstring injury while running out a ground ball. Gsellman allowed three runs and escaped with a no-decision.  When you are a pitcher and you have a hamstring injury, it's going to be a long time,  Mets manager Terry Collins said when asked for a prognosis on Gsellman.  It's the basics of the game. He's running hard -- I salute him for that. He had a chance to beat it out and create a big inning.  Miami starter Dan Straily also got a no-decision, allowing two runs in five innings. Both teams scored in the first. Curtis Granderson pulled a leadoff homer just inside the foul pole in right for his 11th homer of the season. It was the 45th time he led off a game with a homer, the most among all active players in the majors. He has a franchise-record 21 leadoff homers for the Mets, including two within the past week. Miami took a 3-1 lead on a two-out, two-run single by Justin Bour on a 3-2 pitch and a run-scoring double by Martin Prado. Bour, not speedy, scored from first when Prado's line-drive stuck near the wall in the left-field corner. New York cut its deficit to 3-2 in the fourth. Lucas Duda doubled to the right-field corner, Jose Reyes drew a walk, and Travis d'Arnaud grounded an RBI single to center. New York nearly tied the score later in the same inning on what appeared to be an infield single by Gsellman, who pulled up injured just before he hit the first-base bag. And just as Gsellman was thrown out by second baseman Dee Gordon, Reyes was sliding into home plate, all for naught.  I need to work on (fielding drills) apparently,  said Straily, who had the ball bounce off his glove before Gordon made the play.  The ball bounced higher than I thought.  That was a pretty cool play by Dee. He always breaks for the ball. He doesn't always trust us pitchers, and that was a case where he bailed me out big time.  It's unfortunate Gsellman got hurt on the play. You wonder if I fielded it cleanly if any of that would have happened.  In the seventh, d'Arnaud tied the score 3-3 with his ninth homer of the season, a solo blast just over the fence in left. D'Arnaud quickly turned on inside fastball by reliever Kyle Barraclough. Barraclough (4-1) got the win despite allowing the homer in his one inning. The Marlins used five relievers to close out the game, including A.J. Ramos, who earned his 13th save of the year. NOTES: Marlins 1B Justin Bour leads the team with 13 multiple-RBI games. ... The Mets have hit 48 homers in June, a franchise record for most in any month. ... Mets LF Michael Conforto, who was hit by a pitch Sunday and suffered a contusion on his left wrist, wasn't in the starting lineup. ...

Tampa Bay blew a two-run lead in the bottom of the ninth after Cobb exited, but the Rays scored twice in the top of the 10th off of normally reliable Pirates reliever Felipe Rivero for a 4-2 win over the Pittsburgh on Tuesday night at PNC Park. Cobb got a no-decision despite a gem of a game. He was a little better than Pittsburgh starter Trevor Williams, who also got a no-decision. Cobb had a no-hitter through six innings. In eight innings, he struck out four and walked one while yielding just two hits.  Our outlook as pitchers doesn't really change much,  Cobb said.  I think if you have a blowout game that you're fortunate to be on the right side, you go and attack the (strike) zone a little bit more. But pitchers' duel, or a three-, four-run lead, I don't think your approach changes that much. You never want to get hit out there. You're always doing your best to get outs and induce contact and get quick outs so you can work deeper into the game.  Steven Souza led off the 10th with a single up the middle. He scored to make it 3-2 when a grounder by Wilson Ramos went off the glove of third baseman David Freese for an error.  I just booted the ball,  Freese said.  It was good (hop). I just chose to backhand it, thinking it would give me a stronger throw wherever it was going. I just botched it. I've got to make the play and keep us alive.

Rivero (3-2), recently converted to Pittsburgh's closer, saw his ERA rise from 0.68 to 0.88. Tampa Bay reliever Tommy Hunter pitched a flawless 10th for his first save. The Pirates (35-42) scored twice in the ninth on Andrew McCutchen's one-out, two-run double against closer Alex Colome (2-3) to tie the game 2-2 and send it into extra innings. Although he blew the save, Colome got the win. On Sunday, Colome gave up three runs in a loss against the Baltimore Orioles.  Alex had a rough inning. He's had a rough couple of outings,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  Not going to read too much into it. He's allowed to go through some lumps, just like a lot of our players are. He'll get through it. We're confident in that.  Cobb is moving in the other direction. Eight of his past 11 outings have been quality starts.  You tip your hat. He was a craftsman out there,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said of Cobb.  He was spotting that fastball, and throwing that breaking ball makes the fastball click so much better.  Williams struck out seven -- matching his career high for the second start in a row -- over seven-plus innings. He allowed six hits and no walks, giving up a run in the fourth and another in the eighth. Williams was more than magnanimous after watching what Cobb did.  He threw a great game, there's no doubt about that,  Williams said.  Baseball is a game of inches. It's unfortunate (Cobb) didn't get the win today for what he did pitching on the mound.  Tampa Bay (41-38) took a 1-0 lead in the fourth when Corey Dickerson led off with a single to right-center, went to third an out later on Logan Morrison's single to the same spot and scored on Souza's fielder's choice. Josh Harrison broke up Cobb's no-hit attempt when he led off the seventh with a base hit up the middle. McCutchen followed with a single to the same spot, moving Harrison to second. Harrison went to third on Josh Bell's double-play grounder and was stranded there when Freese's grounder to third ended the inning. The Rays doubled their lead and chased Williams in the eighth. Beckham led off with a double down the left-field line and scored to make it 2-0 when Hechavarria -- playing in his first game with Tampa Bay -- hit a chopper that bounced high off the glove of a leaping Freese at third. Reliever Juan Nicasio then came in and got Pittsburgh out of the inning. NOTES: Tampa activated SS Adeiny Hechavarria (left oblique strain) from the disabled list, and he started.

I was hoping they would be tired from last night,  said Ross. Maybe both teams were. Twenty-four hours after blowing leads of 7-1 and 9-2 in losing a 15-9 slugfest, Texas won a tense pitcher's duel, 2-1, Tuesday night at Progressive Field. Adrian Beltre's solo home run with two outs in the ninth inning was the difference in a game in which there were only six hits, three by each team.  This was a huge win for us because of the way we lost last night,  Beltre said. Beltre, who had two of Texas' three hits, provided the drama. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at IndiansTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchWith the score tied at 1-1, Cleveland closer Cody Allen (0-4) entered the game and retired the first two batters of the ninth inning. But Beltre hit Allen's first pitch over the left field wall for his fifth home run of the season.  I was looking for a first-pitch fastball, and he threw one,  Beltre said.  Cody's fastball got elevated and (Beltre) was able to hit it out,  said Cleveland acting manager Brad Mills.  Sometimes you've got to tip your cap.  The home run was also the 450th of Beltre's career, which puts him 39th on baseball's all-time list.  It's a good milestone, but I'm not thinking about that now,  Beltre said.  After last night, our mindset is to win this series, and we got the first win.  Keone Kela (4-1) pitched one scoreless inning to get the win. Matt Bush pitched the ninth to pick up his 10th save.  Just another piece of the legend of Adrian Beltre,  said Texas manager Jeff Banister.  Especially after the way we lost last night. But you've got to have a short memory and come back the next day ready to play.  Both starting pitchers were outstanding, and had nearly identical lines. Cleveland's Mike Clevinger pitched six innings, allowing one run on two hits with a career-high nine strikeouts and two walks.  He was very good,  said Mills.  The first couple innings he threw a lot of pitches, but then he started getting confident and was attacking the zone, and his pitch count leveled off. He did a really good job against a good hitting club.  Texas starter Ross pitched six innings and allowed one run on two hits, with five strikeouts and two walks.  After the third inning, I got into a rhythm and was able to hold them down,  Ross said.  I just tried to change speeds and stay out of the middle of the plate.  Ross held the Indians to one run on two hits through the first five innings. That run came in the second inning. Jose Ramirez led off by drawing a walk and stole second. Lonnie Chisenhall followed with a soft single to center that scored Ramirez with Cleveland's only run. In the top of the second, Clevinger gave up a single and walk to start the inning, but retired the next three batters in order, striking out two -- one of those being former Cleveland teammate Mike Napoli. Texas tied it in the fifth inning. Clevinger retired the first two batters of the inning, but when a 2-1 breaking ball tumbled into the fat part of the plate, Robinson Chirinos whacked it into the left-field bleachers for his 11th home run to tie it at 1-1.  Clevinger was keeping us off balance, but Chirinos was able to get the big hit,  Banister said. It was Texas' first win against Cleveland this year. The Indians had won the first four games between the two teams. NOTES: Indians manager Terry Francona, who became ill during Monday's game and spent the night at the Cleveland Clinic, was resting at home and missed Tuesday's game.

The Agricultural Development Bank of China (ADBC), one of China's major policy lenders, announced the plan to issue 16 billion yuan ($2.35 billion) worth of fixed-rate bonds in Beijing late Tuesday on the website of the state-owned clearing house. These bonds would mark the country's first round of policy bank bonds issued specifically for offshore investors, with the planned issuance coming against the backdrop of the imminent launch of the long-awaited Bond Connect scheme. While regulators have not said when the programme will begin, it is expected to be announced and launched to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule on July 1. In its statement, ADBC said that it would issue up to 5 billion yuan each of one-year, three-year and five-year notes in the first round of tender targeting both onshore and offshore investors, and up to an additional 500 million yuan each of one-year and three-year notes in a second round for offshore investors only.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Denver filed an emergency motion with the federal 10th Circuit Court of Appeals to halt the release of Jamshid Muhtorov.  The motion came four days after U.S. District Judge John Kane granted a motion by Muhtorov for his release pending his trial, which is set for early next year. Muhtorov argued he should be given bail after repeated delays in the case violated his right to a speedy trial. In their appeal, prosecutors said Muhtorov was  plainly a threat to the public and others,  and also posed a flight risk. Muhtorov, 40, is accused of trying to smuggle smart phones and other electronic equipment to the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU), a Pakistan-based extremist group that opposes secular rule in Uzbekistan and seeks to install a government based on Islamic law. He is not a U.S. citizen but has legal immigration status as a political refugee from Uzbekistan, prosecutors said. Muhtorov has lived in the Denver suburb of Aurora. He was arrested in January 2012 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as he was attempting to board an overseas flight, according to an FBI arrest warrant affidavit. The defendant had pledged allegiance to the IJU and promised to procure cash and satellite equipment for the group, prosecutors said.  Given Muhtorov's expressed desire to join the IJU and forward its mission of terrorism, he is also plainly a threat to the public and others under any form of release,  the government's appellate motion said. In agreeing to set bond conditions, Judge Kane said that, while Muhtorov's purported jihadist views are  abhorrent,  he will have already spent six years in prison by the time he goes on trial, about the same amount of time he would likely serve if convicted. He faces a maximum 15 years in prison if convicted. The judge cited Muhtorov's family ties in Colorado and evidence that suggests his  bark was more serious than his bite.   No one was killed or wounded in the plot, which was thwarted. A gag order imposed by Kane prohibits lawyers from either side from discussing the case outside a courtroom. Muhtorov's lawyers had not filed a reply to the government's motion by Tuesday evening, and it was unclear when the appellate court would rule.

On Tuesday night, Cincinnati gave up three homers, but the Reds hit four of their own to outslug the Milwaukee Brewers. Joey Votto and Adam Duvall hit two-run homers, and Billy Hamilton and Eugenio Suarez added solo shots to lift Cincinnati to an 8-6 victory over the first-place Brewers in the opener of a three-game series at Great American Ball Park. Travis Shaw hit a three-run homer and Orlando Arcia and Manny Pina added solo shots for Milwaukee, which spent its 38th day alone in first place in the National League Central. It was the 22nd time that seven home runs were hit in a game since Great American Ball Park opened in 2003.  We hit 15 or 16 balls right on the screws,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  It wasn't just the homers. There were a lot of quality at-bats. Billy set the tone with the leadoff homer.  Milwaukee's Ryan Braun went 1-for-5 with a double in his first game back after missing 31 games with a left calf strain. Junior Guerra (1-2) took the loss after allowing eight runs in four-plus innings. Guerra missed more than a month with a right calf strain. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at RedsCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatch The first couple of starts he pitched well,  said Brewers manager Craig Counsell.  Where he gets in trouble is when he struggles with his fastball control. He struggled with all of his pitches a little tonight. He paid for his mistakes.  Tim Adleman (5-4) got the win despite allowing five runs and three home runs in five innings. He yielded five hits and three walks while striking out seven.  Adleman didn't have his best game, but he battled,  Price said.  He would have gone back out there if we didn't get to that spot in the order (in the fifth). We wanted to add some more runs there.  The Reds (32-44) won for only the third time in 17 games and for the second time in eight meetings this season against Milwaukee (41-38). The Brewers had the bases loaded with two outs in the eighth, but Michael Lorenzen retired Stephen Vogt, who was making his Brewers debut as a pinch hitter, on a fly ball to right to end the inning. Raisel Iglesias retired the Brewers in order in the ninth for his 13th save. Reds right fielder Scott Schebler ran down Eric Thames' long drive up against the wall for the final out. Thames, who homered eight times in seven games this season against Cincinnati, went 0-for-4 with a walk and a strikeout on Tuesday.  That saved us from having to face Shaw with the tying run, and he's having a tremendous year,  Price said of Schebler's play. Hamilton's opposite-field home run in the first inning put Cincinnati ahead 1-0. It was only the second leadoff homer in Hamilton's career.  That don't happen too often for me,  Hamilton said.  I'm just trying to hit line drives.  With one out and a runner aboard, Duvall launched Guerra's 0-1 pitch into the second deck of the left field bleachers to make it 3-0. Devin Mesoraco added an RBI single to complete a four-run first in which Guerra also walked two and hit a batter. Milwaukee homered twice off Adleman in the second with Pina belting his fifth and Arcia his sixth to cut the Brewers' deficit to 4-2. Shaw's three-run homer in the third put the Brewers ahead 5-4. His 16th home run tied a single-season career high. Suarez tied the score 5-5 in the third with his 12th homer. Suarez went 1-for-2 with two walks while batting fifth.  It's great to see him drive the ball to right-center,  Price said.  The two walks also show his plate discipline. It's an important spot in the order. He's handled the ups and downs of the season very well.  Votto put the Reds ahead 7-5 with his 21st home run in the fifth. Guerra didn't make it out of the fifth after allowing the first four batters to reach. He allowed eight hits, half of which were homers.  I was getting behind in the count most of the game and missing spots,  said Guerra, through interpreter Carlos Brizuela.  All of the home runs were on fastballs with bad location. The velocity is still lower than last year, but at the same time, you've got to hit your location.

Greaterchina Professional Services Ltd was among the biggest losers, with its shares diving 30 percent after falling 93 percent on Tuesday. Greaterchina Professional Services was among scores of stocks named in a report by activist shareholder David Webb six weeks ago titled  The Enigma Network: 50 stocks not to own . The list included several stocks listed on Hong Kong's second board, or Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), which was down just over 1 percent on Wednesday, having slumped nearly 10 percent on Tuesday to close at a record low. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, Webb said it was unclear what had triggered the sell-off in the  Enigma Network  stocks.  I can only speculate, but it's possible margin calls have been triggering the sell-off – it's possible the brokers involved have been told to stop lending against those shares,  he said.  At the moment it's unclear what happened – maybe the people operating the network have decided to dump and run.  Hong Kong's second board has seen high levels of volatility due to very concentrated shareholdings and concerns have grown over the quality of companies listed on the board.

Just steps away in no-man's land stands the stump of the Hadba minaret, which towered above the city for 850 years until the militants rigged it with explosives and razed it to the ground last week. Getting this deep into Mosul's Old City means soldiers from the Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) must dismount from their armored Humvees and walk for 10 minutes down a maze of narrow alleyways which at some points are barely wider than a man. They climb through holes knocked into walls, entering abandoned homes and courtyards where detritus and concrete rubble is piled up at every turn. Construction is so dense here that vehicles cannot pass and air strikes would likely cause too much collateral damage. The battle to retake Islamic State's de facto capital in Iraq has come down to a band of soldiers with assault rifles maneuvering on foot through the dusty heart of the city. Heavy fighting in close quarters between the elite troops and Islamic State's most hardened fighters has left the Old City so damaged that it is often hard to tell the difference between what constitutes indoors and outdoors. Long Neglect Iraqi forces stormed the Old City, the ultimate target of an eight-month-old campaign to capture Mosul, nine days ago. On Monday they captured the neighborhood of al-Faruq, facing the Hadba minaret and the adjoining al-Nuri mosque, and on Tuesday they retook al-Mashahda neighborhood, the military said. Like the historic districts of great Arab capitals such as Cairo and Damascus, Mosul's Old City holds market stalls, a few mosques and churches, and small houses built and rebuilt on top of each other over the ages. A member of Iraqi forces walks as they advance their positions on the frontline at the Old City in West Mosul, Iraq June 27, 2017.Erik De CastroMost of its stone structures date from the medieval period, but some are older. Modernization initiatives and long neglect had caused significant damage before Islamic State took over, yet the 150-foot (45-metre) leaning Hadba minaret had survived as an icon of the city. Iraq's prime minister has said its destruction amounted to an acknowledgment of defeat by Islamic State. The group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made his only confirmed public appearance in the mosque three years ago to declare the establishment of a modern-day caliphate which is now crumbling. He has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is believed to be hiding in the Iraq-Syria border area, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources. Slideshow (7 Images)The Iraqi military estimates up to 350 militants are besieged in the remaining parts of the Old City, dug in among civilians in crumbling houses and making extensive use of booby traps, suicide bombers and sniper fire to slow the troops advancing from west, north and south. More than 50,000 civilians are trapped behind Islamic State lines with little food, water or medicine, according to those who have escaped. None were visible on Tuesday in government-controlled parts of the Old City. Only a handful of neighborhoods remain outside the control of Iraqi forces, and while authorities expect the offensive to end in the coming days, their advance remains arduous. In the courtyard of a dilapidated home, a soldier launches a white commercial drone. As it buzzes skyward, officers gather on a couch to inspect enemy defenses on the transmitted video feed. Soldiers, who dash through alleys blocked up precariously with stones and furniture, said snipers and suicide bombers remained the primary resistance from Islamic State. They chat with each other about how to adjust to fighting more from outside their Humvees.  The blocks in this area are uneven, so it's not a direct confrontation,  said one soldier.  Sometimes they jump out from around a corner.  Reporting By Stephen Kalin; Editing by Janet Lawrence","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-oldcity-idUSKBN19I27N"},

Iraqi forces, battling up to 350 militants dug in among civilians in the Old City, said federal police had dislodged IS insurgents from the Ziwani mosque and were only a few days away from ousting militants completely from the Old City.  The victory announcement will come in a very short time,  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on his website on Monday evening.  The operation is continuing to free the remaining parts of the Old City,  Lieutenant General Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi of the Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) told a Reuters correspondent near the frontline in the heart of the Old City. Iraqi forces had about 600 meters (2,000 ft) of ground left to cover before reaching Mosul's Corniche road along the western bank of the Tigris, federal police commander Lieutenant General Raed Shaker Jawdat told Iraqi State TV.  In a few days our forces will reach Corniche and bring the battle to its conclusion,  said Jawdat. The fall of the northern Iraqi city would mark the end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate  proclaimed by Islamic State, though the militant group remains in control of large areas of both Iraq and Syria. In Syria, the Islamic State-held capital of Raqqa, is virtually encircled by a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition.      Federal police and elite CTS units in Mosul were battling with IS fighters in the Old City's maze of narrow alleyways, along with the army and interior ministry units. Related CoverageIn Mosul's Old City, Iraqi soldiers on foot fight last pocket of Islamic StateIslamic State has lost about half the Old City since the battle for the historic district started ten days ago. About one  sq km (0.4 sq mile) remained under its control, according to Iraqi state TV.  The army's 16th infantry division seized on Tuesday the al-Mashahda quarter, in the northwestern corner of the Old City, and federal police took al-Bayd and Ras al-Jadda, in the southwestern quarter, military statements said.  Up to 350 militants are estimated by the Iraqi military to be dug in the Old City among civilians in wrecked houses and crumbling infrastructure. They are trying to slow the advance of Iraqi forces by laying booby traps and using suicide bombers and snipers. Those residents who have escaped say many of the civilians trapped behind Islamic State lines -- put at 50,000 by the Iraqi military - are in a desperate situation with little food, water or medicines.

Human Shields The Iraqi government once hoped to take Mosul by the end of 2016, but fighting has dragged on as militants have reinforced positions in civilian areas, effectively using residents as human shields.  Hundreds of civilians who managed to escape as the forces advanced into the Old City gathered on the side of the road at the edge of western Mosul on Tuesday.  But hundreds of civilians have been killed in the past month as they tried to flee the Old City. Slideshow (20 Images)The militants last week destroyed the historic Grand al-Nuri Mosque and its leaning minaret from which their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate spanning parts of Iraq and Syria three years ago. The mosque's grounds remain under the militants' control.   Iraqi troops on Monday captured the al-Faruq quarter, facing the mosque, the military said. Only a handful of districts remained to be cleared, al-Saadi said, standing atop a rooftop overlooking al-Faruq street which now marks the frontline, a few dozen meters (yards) from the old mosque. Sporadic sniper fire could be heard, and an incoming rocket, as the troops used a drone to survey the insurgents' defenses. The Iraqi forces started attacking the western side of Mosul in February, a month after taking the side located east of the Tigris.  About 850,000 people, more than a third of Mosul's pre-war population, have fled, seeking refuge with relatives or in camps, according to aid groups. Islamic State's Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is assumed to be hiding on the Iraqi-Syrian border. There has been no confirmation of Russian reports over the past days that he has been killed. The group has carried out sporadic suicide bombings in parts of Mosul using sleeper cells. It launched a wave of such attacks late on Sunday, trying to take control of a district west of the Old City, Hay al-Tanak, and the nearby Yarmuk quarter. Security forces blocked their attempted fight-back, al-Saadi said.

Ltd.'s proposed euro-denominated notes an expected rating of 'A-(EXP)'. The notes are to be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by China-based Bright Food (Group) Co., Ltd. (BFG, A-/Stable). The notes are rated at the same level as BFG's senior unsecured debt rating as they represent direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS Shareholding Reshuffle, Unchanged Linkage: The Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) decreased its direct stake in BFG to 8.77% in 2016, from 54.16% in 2015, after transferring most of its stake to Shanghai Municipal Investment (Group) Corporation (Shanghai Chengtou) and Shanghai Guosheng Group Co., Ltd (Shanghai Guosheng), both 100%-owned by Shanghai SASAC. Shanghai Guosheng currently holds 47.56% of BFG and Shanghai Chengtou holds 43.67%. Shanghai Guosheng serves as Shanghai SASAC's investment holding platform and Shanghai SASAC retains administrative power over BFG's management and strategy. Fitch believes the shareholding reshuffle does not change the linkage between BFG and Shanghai SASAC. Pivotal Policy Role: BFG supplies 44.7% of Shanghai's vegetable and edible agriculture products. The group also manages 85% of Shanghai's policy grain reserves and all edible oil reserves. Fitch considers BFG an indispensable safeguard for the city's food quality and believes that as more food-safety regulations are enacted, BFG will solidify its policy role in the industry. Public Listings Add Liquidity: BFG successfully listed its property assets through a backdoor listing of Bright Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. in November 2015. BFG also plans to list Manassen Foods in the near term and is considering listing more subsidiaries to increase return on equity. BFG's liquidity position will benefit from the listings. Leverage Under Control: BFG has acquired several overseas companies since 2010, most recently completing an acquisition of 50% of New Zealand-based meat producer Silver Fern Farms Limited in December 2016. Management has indicated that BFG is committed to integrating the companies it has acquired and at the same time lowering its leverage in the mid-term. In April 2017, BFG announced its deal to sell its 60% stake in Weetabix Food Company to US-based cereal maker Post Holding Inc for GBP1.4 billion based on its enterprise value. BFG's FFO-adjusted net leverage was 5.7x at end-2016 and we expect leverage to remain relatively stable over the medium term if management follows through on its commitments. DERIVATION SUMMARY Fitch assesses BFG's rating by notching down from its internal assessment of the creditworthiness of Shanghai SASAC, reflecting the close linkage between the two entities. BFG is Shanghai's largest vertically integrated trader and supplier of agricultural and food products and services, and is fully owned by Shanghai SASAC. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for BFG include: - Revenue to reach CNY166 billion by 2018 (2016: CNY154 billion) - Revenue growth of below 10% in 2017-2018 (2016: 5%) - EBITDA margin improving to around 8% in 2017-2018 (2016: 7.3%) RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - an upgrade of Fitch's internal assessment of the creditworthiness of the Shanghai Municipality. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - a lowering of Fitch's internal assessment of the creditworthiness of the Shanghai Municipality or evidence of a weakening of BFG's legal, operational and strategic linkages with the Shanghai Municipality. LIQUIDITY BFG had total cash and equivalents of CNY33 billion and unutilised bank facilities of CNY210 billion at end-2016, which are more than sufficient to repay and refinance its outstanding short-term debt of CNY44 billion.

Defense Minister Tomomi Inada, speaking on Tuesday at a rally for ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates in  Sunday's Tokyo Metropolitan assembly election, asked for voter support saying the request was from  the defense ministry, the Self-Defense Forces, the defense minister and the LDP .  By law, the SDF, as Japan's military is known, must be politically neutral. Inada withdrew the remark at an impromptu news conference, saying it could be  misunderstood . The July 2 vote for the Tokyo Metropolitan assembly is on the surface a referendum on Governor Yuriko Koike's first year in office, but it is also shaping up as a chance for voters in the capital to express their views on Abe's administration. Koike is aiming for her new  Tokyo Residents First  party and its allies to win a majority in the 127-seat assembly, while the LDP hopes to keep its status as the biggest party. Abe's support slumped in surveys released last week on voter concerns about suspicions that he helped a friend get permission to open a veterinary school in a special economic zone and criticism his ruling bloc rammed a contentious bill through parliament and ended the session to close off debate. Abe and his aides have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the approval process for the new school to be run by Kake Gakuen (Kake Educational Institution)  Inada's remarks prompted a call from the main opposition Democratic Party leader, Renho, for her resignation, but Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference that she had withdrawn her remark and should remain in her post. The flap follows a widely publicized incident in which a female LDP lawmaker was taped verbally and physically abusing her aide. The lawmaker has left the LDP. Finance Minister Taro Aso, known for making gaffes of his own, later appeared to blame the incident on the lawmaker's gender.  If you look at her academic background, it’s impeccable, but she is a woman,” Aso was quoted by media as telling LDP members on Saturday. Media reports said on Wednesday that the LDP, worried about the Tokyo race, was considering asking Shinjiro Koizumi, the popular 36-year-old lawmaker son of ex-premier Junichiro Koizumi, to campaign for its candidates.

Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which handles one out of seven containers shipped globally, said the Petya cyber attack had caused outages at its computer systems across the world on Tuesday. The attack came as computer servers across Europe and in India were hit by a major ransomware attack.  Global cyber-attack Petya is affecting multiple businesses,  Maersk said on Twitter. The breakdown affected all business units at Maersk, including container shipping, port and tug boat operations, oil and gas production, drilling services, and oil tankers, the company said. The IT breakdown could extend across the company's global operations, a spokeswoman said, but could not say how Maersk's operations were impacted. With a fleet of more than 600 container vessels, Maersk is the world's biggest shipping company with a market share of around 16 percent.

The Nikkei share average shed 0.2 percent to 20,181.62 in midmorning trade, while gains in banking stocks and insurers supported the broader Topix, which tacked on 0.1 percent. U.S. Benchmark 10-year notes dropped 18/32 in price to yield 2.20 percent overnight, up from 2.14 percent late on Monday after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that it is appropriate to gradually raise rates.  Yellen's comment is supporting Japanese financial stocks today, and for the long-term, Japanese stocks are on the rising trend supported by U.S.-led global economic recovery,  said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities. Banks and insurers, which invest in higher yielding products such as foreign bonds, surged 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group gained 2.1 percent, Mizuho Financial Group soared 2.6 percent and Dai-ichi Life Holdings advanced 2.2 percent. Traders said overall sentiment was subdued as investors remain cautious after a healthcare bill was delayed in the U.S. Senate, raising fresh questions about President Donald Trump's domestic agenda.

But as the hard-hitting Latvian limbers up for Wimbledon, her near contemporary from Russia, Daria Kasatkina, is staking her own claim to carry the standard for the sport's next generation. Both women had a brush with Simona Halep in Paris, Ostapenko beating the third-seeded Romanian in an unforgettable final while Kasatkina lost in a third-round match that, until nerves apparently intervened, she looked poised to take to a third set. Born within a month of each other in mid-1997, they also have decent track records at the All England Club. Kasatkina, whose game relies more on placement and changes of pace than raw power, reached the last 32 in 2016, where she was edged out in three tight sets by eventual semi-finalist Venus Williams. Ostapenko, who says Wimbledon is her favorite tournament, won the junior title in 2014. For American Tracy Austin, in the vanguard of the teenage revolution that helped popularize the women's game in the 1980s, the Latvian's emergence as a genuine star from among a host of young hopefuls will have come as no surprise. High Ceilings FILE PHOTO: Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France, June 10, 2017   Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko celebrates by kissing the trophy after winning the final against Romania's Simona Halep.Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo So many young kids are used to winning in the juniors and then they come in and they take the hits from the pros. How do they make that transition when they're losing a little bit more?  Austin told Reuters in the run-up to Roland Garros.   To me, Ostapenko and Kasatkina have very high ceilings and I think it's exciting for women’s tennis.  In retaining confidence in her clumping groundstrokes to overpower older and more experienced opponents, the Latvian has leapt across the gap separating the junior from the senior game. But Austin, who won the first of her two U.S. Opens as a 16-year-old in 1979, identified the same blend of talent and determination she views as a prerequisite for success in the Russian. Kasatkina won her maiden main tour singles title at the Charleston Open in April, and Austin - working as an analyst for U.S. network Tennis Channel - was there to see every shot.  Every match had some different element that (Kasatkina) had to deal with... Every match she had to problem-solve,  the American said.   Sometimes she was aggressive sometimes she realized it was more beneficial to go back to defense. Sometimes she hit hard, sometimes she chipped and drop-shotted or hit loppy balls.  That thoughtful approach was good enough to win the final 6-3 6-1. The Russian's opponent on that day was Ostapenko - though it seems fair to say the Latvian has come a long way since.

Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, first put forward the idea for the town hall talks in an interview with a Birmingham, Alabama, TV station last week, five days after Cosby's sex assault trial ended in a hung jury. The proposal drew immediate criticism from a lawyer representing some of the dozens of women who have leveled sex assault accusations at the 79-year-old entertainer, whose long career was built on a family-friendly style of comedy.  The current propaganda that I am going to conduct a sexual assault tour is false,  Cosby said in a statement released by Wyatt on Tuesday.  Any further information about public plans will be given at the appropriate time.  Wyatt said in the TV interview last week that Cosby, once known as  America's dad  for his starring role in the 1980s TV hit  The Cosby Show,  planned to give free public appearances to address the dangers that young men face. On Tuesday, Wyatt said his comments were taken out of context and that Cosby was still sifting through speaking invitations from civic organizations and church groups. After a Los Angeles court hearing related to a civil lawsuit by a woman who has accused the comedian of sexual assault, Cosby attorney Angela Agrusa told reporters there was a  lot of miscommunication  about planned public appearances. Cosby, she said, wants to perform again but is unlikely to do so until all criminal charges are resolved.  He doesn't take lightly the charges against him,  she added. Prosecutors in Pennsylvania plan to retry Cosby on charges that he sexually assaulted Andrea Constand at his Philadelphia-area home in 2004. Some 60 women have accused him of sex assault in a string of alleged incidents dating back to the 1960s. The Pennsylvania case is the only one to result in criminal prosecution. Ten women are pursuing either sexual abuse or defamation lawsuits against Cosby. Two cases are headed for back-to-back trials in California next summer. A Los Angeles judge on Tuesday set July 30, 2018, as the trial date for a lawsuit brought by Judy Huth, who says Cosby gave her alcohol and then sexually abused her at the Playboy mansion around 1974 when she was 15. Another lawsuit, filed by former model Chloe Goins, is scheduled for trial in June 2018.

The Outlook is Stable. A Support Rating (SR) of '1' has also been assigned. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS AND SR The ratings assigned reflect Fitch's view of the strong ability and propensity of its parent, UK-based Standard Chartered PLC (SC; A+/Stable/a) and its main operating subsidiary Standard Chartered Bank (SCB; A+/Stable/a), to extend timely and extraordinary support to its wholly owned subsidiary in China, if required. The IDR on SCB China aligns with the Viability Rating (VR) of SCB on the basis of shared businesses, strategic priorities, risk appetite, management and brand identity. The Long-Term IDRs and senior debt ratings of SC and SCB are one notch above their VRs because we believe the risk of default on senior obligations, as measured by the Long-Term IDRs, is lower than the risk of the entities failing, as measured by their VRs. This is because of the presence of a significant junior debt buffer. The uplift does not apply to SCB China as the bank does not benefit from similar buffers. Fitch expects SCB China to continue to play a key role in supporting SC's strategy due to its long-established history, relationships and branch network in mainland China. The bank, which has grown organically from a branch of the UK-based parent, works closely with its parent to attract inbound businesses from multinational corporates operating in China and to support Chinese corporates seeking to go global. SCB China's focus on growing Chinese sectors such as technology and biotech, small and medium-sized enterprises and affluent retail clients, and investing in digital capabilities are integral to SC's priorities in China. Fitch believes that a default by SC's China subsidiary would constitute a significant reputational risk to SC that could undermine its franchise in China and damage its global reputation as a network bank. We believe SC has a strong ability to support SCB China, considering the small size of the China subsidiary (4% of SC's assets at end-2016) and SC's strong capitalization and solid liquidity profile. SCB China accounted for 5% of SC's total revenue, 4% of gross customer loans and 5% of total customer deposits at end-2016. SCB China's integration with SC in terms of asset and liability management primarily stems from it placing excess liquidity with the parent bank and other SC entities (end-2016: net placement of CNY7.8 billion). The China subsidiary is mainly deposit-funded with loans only accounting for 34.5% of assets at end-2016. Fitch does not assign a VR to SCB China as its strategy and operations are closely aligned with those of its parent. In addition, SCB China's access to funding significantly benefits from its association with SC as the majority of its deposits stems from SC's network customers. The Stable Outlook of the bank mirrors that of its parent. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SR SCB China's IDR and SR are sensitive to Fitch's assumptions about the ability or propensity of SC to extend extraordinary support in a timely manner. A decline in SCB China's relevance for SC's strategy would be negative for the rating. Any change in SC's VR is likely to lead to similar rating action on SCB China, subject to China's Country Ceiling which is currently at 'A+'. The rating actions are as follows: Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'F1' Support Rating at '1' Contact: Primary Analyst Veronica Lau Director +852 2263 9924 Fitch (Hong Kong) Limited 19/F Man Yee Building 68 Des Voeux Road Central Hong Kong Secondary Analyst Sabine Bauer Senior Director +852 2263 9966 Committee Chairperson Tim Roche +61 2 8256 0310 Senior Director Date of Relevant Rating Committee: 23 June 2017 Media Relations: Wai-Lun Wan, Hong Kong, Tel: +852 2263 9935, Email: wailun.wan@fitchratings.com.

The euro was fetching $1.1338, after surging 1.4 percent on Tuesday and scaling a high of around $1.1349, its strongest level since late August 2016. That rally came after ECB President Mario Draghi said at a conference in Portugal on Tuesday that deflationary forces had been replaced by reflationary ones. But any change in the ECB's stance should be gradual as  considerable  monetary support is still needed and the rebound in inflation will also depend on favourable global financing conditions, he added. Traders said the euro could add to its gains in the near term.  With the hawkish tone of Draghi, we should see European rates moving higher, especially on the 10-year part of the curve, and the euro I think has more room to move higher,  said Tareck Horchani, head of sales trading Asia-Pacific for Saxo Bank Group in Singapore. The euro now faces resistance at $1.14, and could get a further boost if that level is breached, Horchani said. Against the yen, the euro rose to 127.47 yen on Tuesday, its strongest level since April 2016. It was last at 127.18 yen. The dollar nursed its losses, having come under pressure overnight after U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a vote on healthcare legislation, hoping to get more support from Republican senators. Market participants are concerned that the Trump administration will find it hard to follow through with tax cuts and fiscal stimulus steps, without first getting the healthcare bill passed. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 96.443 , after shedding about 1 percent on Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar eased 0.1 percent to 112.18 yen .

Jain is one of millions of small business owners who face wrenching change from India's biggest tax reform since independence that will unify the country's $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into a common market. But he is simply not ready for a regime that from July 1 will for the first time tax the bed linen his 10 workers make, and require him to file his taxes every month online. On the desk in his tiny office in Meerut, two hours drive northeast of New Delhi, lay two calculators. Turning to open a metal cabinet, he pulled out a hand-written ledger to show how he keeps his books.  We will have to hire an accountant - and get a computer,  the thickset 52-year-old told Reuters, as a dozen ancient power looms clattered away in the ramshackle workshop next door. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that by replacing several federal and state taxes, the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) will make life simpler for business. To drive home the point, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan has appeared in a promotional video in which he weaves a cat's cradle between the fingers of his hands - symbolising India's thicket of old taxes. With a flourish, the tangle is gone and Bachchan proclaims:  One nation, one tax, one market!  (bit.ly/2sch8ou) Not So Simple By tearing down barriers between India's 29 states, the GST should deliver efficiency gains to larger businesses. HSBC estimates the reform could add 0.4 percent to economic growth. Yet at the local chapter of the Indian Industries Association, which groups 6,500 smaller enterprises nationwide, the talk is about how to cope in the aftermath of the GST rollout.  In the initial months, there may be utter confusion,  said chairman Ashok Malhotra, who runs one firm that manufactures voltage stabilisers and a second that makes timing equipment for boxing contests. A big concern is the Indian GST's sheer complexity - with rates of 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent, and myriad exceptions, it contrasts with simpler, flatter and broader sales taxes in other countries. The official schedule of GST rates runs to 213 pages and has undergone repeated last-minute changes.  Rubber goods are taxed at 12 percent; sporting goods at 18 percent. I make rubber sporting goods – so what tax am I supposed to pay?  asks Anurag Agarwal, the local IIA secretary. Grace Period? The top government official responsible for coordinating the GST rollout rebuts complaints from bosses that the tax is too complex, adding that the IT back-end that will drive it - crunching up to 5 billion invoices a month - is robust.  It is a technological marvel, as well as a fiscal marvel,  Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia told Reuters in an interview. The government will, however, allow firms to file simplified returns for July and August. From September they must file a total of 37 online returns annually - three each month and one at the year's end - for each state they operate in. One particular concern is how a new feature of the GST, the input tax credit, will work. This allows a company to claim refunds on its inputs and means it should only pay tax on the value it adds. The structure will encourage companies to buy from suppliers that are GST-compliant, so that tax credits can flow down a supply chain. That spells bad news for small firms hesitating to shift into the formal economy. The government estimates smaller companies account for 45 percent of manufacturing and employ more than 117 million people. Adhia played down the risk of job losses, however, saying this would be offset by new service sector jobs. Demonetisation 2.0 The prospect of disruption is drawing comparisons with Modi's decision last November to scrap high-value bank notes that made up 86 percent of the cash in circulation, in a bid to purge illicit  black money  from the system. The note ban caused severe disruption to India's cash-driven economy and slammed the brakes on growth, which slowed to a two-year low in the quarter to March.  It could throw the business out of gear - it can affect your volumes by at least 30 percent,  said the head of one large cement company in the Delhi region. Back in Meerut, Pankaj Jain worries that hiring an accountant and charging 5 percent GST on his bedsheets could eat up to two-thirds of his annual profits of 400,000-500,000 rupees ($6,210-$7,760).  I know my costs will go up, but I don't know about my income,  he said.  I might even have to shut up shop completely and go into trading.

But one thing remains the same; winning the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year is still arguably the sport's biggest challenge. Since Rod Laver did it in 1969, only three men – Bjorn Borg, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer – and six women - Margaret Court, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf and Serena Williams – have managed the feat. The change in surface from clay to grass, and the fact that the two events are almost back to back in the calendar, have always made it a tough proposition.  It’s easily the toughest challenge in tennis,  said Mats Wilander, who won the French Open three times but never made it past the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.  I think more in men’s professional tennis than in women’s, because it’s harder to break serve. I think it’s by far the toughest challenge we have in men’s professional tennis.   When Wimbledon decided to move back a week in the calendar, in 2015, it was intended to extend the grasscourt season and give those who had been involved in the latter stages in Paris more time to adapt. Serena Williams certainly took advantage when she did the double in 2015, but on the men’s side no one has managed it since Nadal did it for a second time in 2010. Wilander, who will be working as a pundit for Eurosport during Wimbledon, said the extra week between the two grand slams helped, noting that the change in style of play was even tougher in his day as the grass at Wimbledon was much faster then.  The difference between clay-court tennis and grass-court tennis in those days, it’s not even comparable. I would serve and volley on both serves because otherwise you would be laughed at by all the Australians.    It was difficult to make the right choice at the right time. It didn’t come naturally when you have such little time to prepare for a new surface and it’s not your natural way of playing.   Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 11, 2017   Spain's Rafael Nadal in action during the final against Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka   Reuters / Christian HartmannWorld number one Andy Murray won his second Wimbledon title last summer, when he also reached the final at Roland Garros, and said the extra time was invaluable.  It makes a huge difference. Just a bit more time to adapt to the courts and let your body get used to playing on grass again,  he said last week.  (Before), literally, sometimes it was like one or two days. I mean, it was ridiculous, looking back at it, really.  Only the Greatest?  File photo: Britain Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club, Wimbledon, England - 1/7/16 General view during USA's Serena Williams match against USA's Christina McHaleStefan WermuthBetween 2008 and 2010 it seemed like the difficulty was overstated, as Nadal (twice) and Federer (in 2009) did the double. But all nine players to do it have won at least 10 grand slam titles, so perhaps it's more that only the greatest of all can achieve the feat. When Nadal won Wimbledon in 2010, he said winning either slam was not so difficult in itself, but that the effort spent in winning in Paris meant it was easy to run out of steam.  You are coming from American hard-court season,  he said at the time.  So one month in America, then two months in Europe, playing on clay. Then mentally if you are able to win Roland Garros, you already played a lot of time at your top, mentally and physically.  Nadal and Jelena Ostapenko, who unexpectedly won her first grand slam title this month at Roland Garros, will try to do it again at Wimbledon. The Latvian won the junior title at the All England Club in 2014 but Nadal has not been past the fourth round since he reached the final in 2011.  I played five finals in Wimbledon (but) since I have had problems with my knee, since 2012, playing on grass has been very complicated for me,  said Nadal, who pulled out of last week’s Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club soon after he won his 10th French Open title.  We'll see how my knee behaves. Playing on grass is very special. You need to play at a lower level. The body posture is down. You have less stability. On grass, anything can happen.   editing by John Stonestreet","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-double-idUSKBN19J03Y"},

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg disclosed the number to his followers in a Facebook post.  It's an honor to be on this journey with you,  he wrote. (bit.ly/2sefWFL) The user base is bigger than the population of any single country, and of six of the seven continents. It represents more than a quarter of the world's 7.5 billion people.  Facebook defines a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through its website or a mobile device, or used its Messenger app, in the past 30 days. It does not include people who use the Instagram or WhatsApp networks but not Facebook. The company said in May that duplicate accounts, according to an estimate from last year, may have represented some 6 percent of its worldwide user base. The social network's user population dwarfs that of similar companies. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) reported in April monthly active users of 328 million, while Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) Snapchat had 166 million daily users at the end of the first quarter.  The logo of the social network Facebook is seen on a beach during the Cannes Lions Festival in Cannes, France, June 21, 2017.Eric GaillardWeChat, a unit of Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) and a widely used service in China, said in May that it had 938 million monthly active users in the first quarter.  Facebook had 1.94 billion people using its service monthly as of March 31, an increase of 17 percent from a year earlier. It reached 1 billion in October 2012.  The company, which Zuckerberg started in 2004 in his college dorm room, uses its huge size advantage to lure advertisers, offering them highly targeted marketing capabilities based on its data about users.  The number of advertisers topped 5 million in April, the company said. Facebook's growth has increasingly come from outside the United States, Canada and Europe. Three years ago, those regions accounted for some 38 percent of users, compared with about 30 percent in the first quarter of this year.  To increase penetration rates in developing nations, Facebook has rolled out pared-down versions of its apps that use less data, and it has been developing solar-powered drones to extend internet connectivity around the planet.

Motor insurers are likely to drop their premium rates to the lowest permissible limits, leading to a deterioration in loss ratios. The claims frequency has declined since the implementation of the trial deregulation of commercial motor premium pricing in June 2015. The mechanism of non-claim discount has incentivised insurers from not reporting small claims, but this impact is only likely to be marginal in 2017. Furthermore, the ongoing escalation in policy-acquisition costs due to market competition will exacerbate the narrowing in underwriting profitability. Fitch expects catastrophe risks to remain a key threat to operating stability. It is inevitable for smaller insurers to increase their reliance on reinsurance to mitigate their claims from severe weather-related events such as flooding. We believe insurers' ability to support cash outflows associated with their 'short-tailed' claims liability may be affected if they were to further raise exposure to alternative investments such as infrastructure debt investment plans or trust products. Most insurers have increased investment allocation in less liquid alternative investments to boost investment yield.

The world's three leading offshore wind operators - DONG Energy, EnBW and Vattenfall - all told Reuters they were looking to these megaturbines to help adapt to the upcoming reality with dwindling government handouts.  According to interviews with turbine makers and engineers, at least one manufacturer - Siemens Gamesa - will have built a prototype megaturbine by next year and the first farms could be up and running in the first half of the next decade.  These massive machines will each stand 300 meters tall – almost as high as London's Shard, western Europe's tallest building - with 200-metre rotor spans that will stretch the length of two football fields.     The wind power sector is at a critical juncture as the subsidies that have cradled it since its inception in the early 1990s, and underpinned its business model, disappear as politicians enact a long-planned push to make the industry more commercially viable and able to compete with other energy sources.  The countries that form the hub of the European offshore wind industry - Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain - are looking to gradually phase out the handouts over the next decade. This will end a crucial source of revenue for operators; in tenders concluded as recently as 2014, subsidies still accounted for around half of European wind projects' income.  With the writing on the wall, DONG and EnBW submitted bids with no subsidies factored in at a tender in April for a German project planned for 2024. The auction represented an industry milestone, the first with zero-subsidy bids, but raised the burning question of how operators will be able to make money and survive while offering a commercially attractive alternative to coal and nuclear.  The answer, according to the companies, are the megaturbines, which would sweep a far bigger area and harness more wind, cutting costs per megawatt. They will each generate between 10 and 15 megawatts (MW) of power - a considerable leap from the largest turbines currently in operation, made by MHI Vestas, which are 195 meters tall and generate 8 MW.  The megaturbines are no sure bet for the companies' bottom lines, however.  There are challenges on the technical front to create monumentally tall towers and light, slender blades that can withstand the strain of gale-force winds.  Economically, there are also doubts among some industry experts about whether zero-subsidy wind projects can make money, even with the increased efficiency delivered by megaturbines.  They say deeper savings must be made by operators across their businesses and electricity prices must also rise significantly to bring profitability.  Michael Guldbrandtsen, offshore wind consultant at MAKE, said there were financial and technical risks associated with megaturbines, but that operators had little choice but to invest in a technology needed to make zero-subsidy projects viable.   Without a significant increase in the size of turbines it would not be possible to ensure a reasonable return,  he added.  Prototype Megaturbine  Operators are nonetheless banking on the new technology.  Michael Simmelsgaard, head of offshore business at Swedish utility Vattenfall, said the industry would cross the 10 MW turbine threshold  faster than many expect now , without being more specific. A 10 W turbine could power about 9,000 homes.   We will definitely see these big turbines,  he added.  FILE PHOTO: Wind turbines are seen in a wind park off the coast of Ijmuiden, the Netherlands, September 3, 2007.Michael Kooren/File PhotoDONG Energy's wind business, Samuel Leupold, laid out more ambitious plans:  We believe we can utilize (turbines) in the range of 13 to 15 megawatts,  he said on the sidelines of an offshore wind conference in London this month - the first time an industry executive has given such a high figure. Previously, companies have only spoken about turbines in the region of 10W.  EnBW also said it was turning to megaturbines.   Size is an important driver of efficiency,  said Dirk Guesewell, its head of generation portfolio development.  Bigger rotors mean fewer turbines and foundations are needed to achieve the same capacity.   German turbine maker Senvion said it was developing megaturbines of over 10 MW. While the machines are still in the design stage, it said it was already offering them for future use to wind farm operators.   We envisage that the installations of those wind farms will take place in the first half of the next decade,  head of Senvion's Global Offshore business, Cornelius Druecker, told Reuters without saying how close the firm was to a prototype.  An independent engineer working with Siemens Gamesa, who asked not to be named as they are authorized to speak publicly, said the German company will have built a prototype megaturbine by next year. Another engineer, who works with several big turbine makers, said designs had almost been completed across the sector and the process of producing prototypes was about to start.   Siemens Gamesa declined to comment.  Slideshow (3 Images)Technical Hurdles  The biggest technical hurdle involves increasing the length of the turbine blades without putting too much strain on the structure which is built on a platform fastened to the seabed.  With spans of around 200 meters, the blades will be about 50 meters longer than those of the most powerful turbines now in operation.  As they are constantly exposed to different levels of wind, their construction, which requires adhesives that join different layers of carbon or glass-fiber to dry at exactly the right temperatures, is extremely complex.  Denmark's state research institute DTU Wind Energy, which has propelled much of the innovation in wind power, is working on keeping down the weight of these super-long blades by bumping up the carbon fiber content. They have designed blade features similar to the flaps on aeroplane wings to control and reduce load variations so turbulence does not break the blades.   Most people understand it is complicated to make calculations on an airplane or a helicopter, but turbines are at least as complicated and it is the same methods we use,  said Flemming Rasmussen, the institute's head of aerodynamic design.  When mass production begins, new factories will be needed with enough space for the blades.  Do Numbers Add Up?  No operator is prepared to publicly disclose the calculations and projections that underpins its strategy, citing commercial sensitivity.  Even with megaturbines in place, the operators would also need other things to go their way to turn a profit without state subsidies - crucially, electricity prices must rise to a level where profitability outstrips investment costs.  Bernstein researchers calculated that, at their current power price forecast, operators would need to reduce their capital expenditure (capex) by around 60 percent for zero-subsidy projects to break even. Increasing turbine sizes from 7 MW to 14 MW would reduce capex by around 40 percent, they added.  The researchers expect a 5-6 euros a megawatt hour (MWh) rise from current power market prices of 30 euros/MWh by 2023.   Cost reductions and power prices will have to be consistently much higher than our predictions for the subsidy free projects to break even,  they said.

In a securities filing, Vale said shareholders approved all seven items on the corporate reorganization agenda, which is a first step toward giving the company dispersed share ownership - where no shareholder controls decision making at the firm.  The change represents a milestone in a country long hobbled by corporate governance abuses and reorganizations that hampered minority investors in most cases. Reuters reported the plan on Jan. 19, citing people familiar with it. The plan also puts a limit to the meddling of politicians in Vale - an aspect that weighed on the company's stock during former President Dilma Rousseff's five years in office. Still, the government will keep a golden share, allowing it to fend off hostile takeover attempts and shape strategic decisions. Investors expect Tuesday's vote to improve investors' perception of Vale, translating into a faster convergence of Vale's share prices to those of rivals, and a decline in the Brazilian miner's cost of capital. In the filing, Vale said the proposed conversion of preferred shares into a single, common stock was approved with the equivalent of 68 percent of preferred shares that participated in the ballot, well above the 54 percent threshold set when the plan was first announced in February. 'Encouraging'  Preferred shares gained 2.4 percent to 26.36 reais, while Vale's common shares added 2.5 percent to 28.15 reais in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday. Under terms of the conversion, holders of Vale's Class A preferred shares will receive 0.9342 of common stock. Investors have 45 days to convert their shares, needing the equivalent of at least 54.09 percent of preferred shares in circulation to go ahead, the filing said. In addition, minority holders voted to allow controlling shareholders grouped under holding company Valepar SA to keep control of Vale for another three and a half years. Vale will eventually absorb Valepar, facilitating the stock conversion. A simpler shareholder structure in which Vale's board, and not Valepar, will decide strategy, and higher liquidity stemming from the end of the Valepar lockup period could trigger a sharp rise in Vale's market capitalization, analysts said.  Results were encouraging with the proposal approved and while there are other important steps ahead ... we are encouraged to see progress on this front, and believe this will be well received by the market,  said Leonardo Correa, a senior analyst with Banco BTG Pactual in São Paulo. To ensure completion of the plan, Vale would pay owners of Valepar a 10 percent premium for their shares, implying a 3 percent dilution for all shareholders.

Sori, who was arrested in 2011 on charges of aiding Maoist rebels in the state, accused the police of torturing and sexually assaulting her while in prison. The crime?  Defending the right of indigenous people to live in an area rich in minerals in what is one of India's poorest states. Police officials, who have since been moved to other locations, deny any mistreatment. Stirred by Sori's call for justice, Gera and a couple of other lawyers left Delhi to set up office in the state's restive Bastar region in 2013. It wasn't long before they were targets. The lawyers said they were followed, had objects thrown into their home, and accused of helping Maoist rebels. They say they were harassed for defending villagers and indigenous people.  They were finally evicted by a fearful landlord last year, and relocated to Bilaspur about 400 km (250 miles) away, where they continued to pursue their cases. Mineral-Rich, Rights-Poor The lawyers have angered plenty of people in high places. A top police official recently said they should be crushed on the highway for going against the state to protect villagers.  Parts of Chhattisgarh are like a war zone,  said Sudha Bharadwaj, a lawyer in Bilaspur who backed Gera and set up a legal aid group, Janhit, for farmers and indigenous people.  There is violence against people who insist on their rights and we are perceived as anti-development for helping them,  said Bharadwaj, 55, who took up law aged 40 to help local people. One of India's least developed states, Chhattisgarh sits atop some of India's biggest reserves of coal, iron ore, bauxite, dolomite, limestone, tin and gold, and accounts for nearly a fifth of the total value of minerals produced in India. At least 25 conflicts are raging in the state - over coal and iron ore, power projects and steel plants - and they affect 70,000 people, according to research firm Land Conflict Watch. The race for resources to spur India's economic growth has pitted some of its most vulnerable people against the state, stalling industrial projects worth billions of dollars. [nL8N1DF11U] There are at least 332 land conflicts nationwide, affecting more than 3.5 million people, according to Land Conflict Watch. Nowhere are these conflicts more violent and bloody than in Chhattisgarh, part of the  Red Corridor  stretching across eastern and central India that has witnessed a Maoist rebellion for more than three decades. The rebels, who say they are fighting for the land rights and empowerment of indigenous people, accuse the government of plundering mineral resources while ignoring the villagers. Adivasis, or  original dwellers , and lower-caste Dalits make up more than 40 percent of the state's 28 million population and traditionally lived in its forests and hills. After the opening of the economy in the early 1990s, tracts of forest land were handed to companies including Adani Group, Jindal Power, Essar and Tata Steel for mines and power plants. Backed by the state, an anti-insurgency militia called Salwa Judum - meaning 'Peace March' or 'Purification March' - began cracking down on the Maoist rebels from 2005 to free up land. A pitched battle ensued, in which hundreds were killed and tens of thousands displaced amid accusations of mass rape, illegal detentions, torture and extra-judicial killings. Activists are caught  between two sets of guns  in the conflict between Maoist combatants and government security forces, Human Rights Watch said in a 2012 report.  The original inhabitants are seen as road blocks that they have to get out of the way to do more mining, build more plants, more industry,  said Bharadwaj. Murder, Treason The fight for land and the environment is  a new battleground for human rights , according to British-based watchdog Global Witness, with India chalking up at least six deaths in 2015 related to land conflicts. [nL8N1DU0LB] In Chhattisgarh, villagers spoke of giving up land at gunpoint while activists faced charges from murder to treason. Lingaram Kodopi, a tribal activist, fled to Delhi after being shot in the leg in 2011. Binayak Sen, a physician, was convicted of treason and sedition in 2010 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Ramesh Agrawal, who received the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize in 2014 for leading a protest that shut down a proposed coal mine, was wounded by masked gunmen in 2012. Sori was attacked again last year with chemicals. Delhi University professor Nandini Sundar was among those charged last year in the killing of an indigenous man in Bastar shortly after she published a book on the conflict.  People opposing the state are not treated as citizens. The state sees it fit to tackle them only through the military,  said Gera, a co-founder of Jagdalpur Legal Aid Group.  Would there be less violence if there were no resources? Perhaps.  'Iron Fist' Laws that protect the rights of farmers and indigenous people - including a 1996 law on tribal areas and the 2006 Forest Rights Act giving traditional forest dwellers access to forest resources - are poorly implemented, activists say. Meanwhile state officials say resource-based industries are needed to spur growth and generate jobs for the state.  We have settled forest rights where requested. If there is any complaint of rights violation, we look into it,  said Subodh Kumar Singh, a senior official in the mines department.  There may be a few displacements, but the people are resettled. The industries are bringing good development.  The Supreme Court in 2011 called Salwa Judum  illegal  and ordered its disbandment. The top court said it was dismayed the only option for the state was  to rule with an iron fist .  But a battle is still raging. Among the cases that Bharadwaj is handling is that of Janki Sidar, who is fighting the unauthorized takeover of her land. The case is 14 years old. Bharadwaj is her 10th lawyer.      It is necessary for us - doctors, lawyers, journalists - to be involved,  said Bharadwaj.  We have to help them confront the power of the state and industry. We have to become their amplifiers to carry their voices to the outside world.

Trump will deliver an address on his administration's new mantra of  energy dominance  at the Energy Department, officials told reporters. They declined to give details on how he would tweak existing regulations that have not stopped a surge in exports.  We’ve gone from the age of scarcity now to the age of abundance when it comes to American energy,  Mike Catanzaro, a White House energy policy aide, told reporters.  We want to use those abundant resources for good here at home and for good abroad as well,  Catanzaro said. Trump's speech comes a week before he meets in Warsaw with leaders of a dozen central and eastern European nations who are eager to see more U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) in their markets as an alternative to Russian gas. Trump is stopping at the summit on his way to the G20 in Hamburg, Germany, where he is expected to meet face-to-face for the first time in his presidency with Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry is introduced to speak by White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders during a briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 27, 2017.Kevin LamarqueShipments of LNG will play a big part in the  energy dominance  strategy, Energy Secretary Rick Perry told reporters, but so will exports of coal and U.S. technology that helps reduce emissions from coal-fired plants, he said. Perry said he discussed the potential for U.S. coal exports to Ukraine with President Petro Poroshenko during his visit to Washington last week. President Donald Trump gives a thumbs up as he walks up the West Wing colonnade to greet India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Modi arrives for a visit in Washington.Kevin LamarqueThe Trump administration believes in an  all-of-the-above  approach to energy, Perry said - borrowing the energy catch-phrase of the Obama administration. U.S. domestic energy prices have plunged in recent years because of the natural gas boom, crowding out competing sources of power, including coal and nuclear. Dozens of nuclear power reactors are in danger of shutting down over the next several years as a result. The Trump administration wants to make sure the United States remains  technologically and economically engaged  in the nuclear industry, Perry said.  If we do not, then China and Russia will fill that void,  he said. But he said the administration would not be  wildly supportive  of subsidizing any sectors of the energy industry. Perry said energy supports in the tax code would be examined as the administration and Congress look at tax reform later this year.  I think we’ll have a good healthy conversation about the energy sector and tax incentives, subsidies - all of that needs to be on the table and we need to have a conversation about it,  Perry said.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 38 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $43.86 per barrel. Oil had recovered some ground over the past week after falling nearly 20 percent since mid-May, but a report by the American Petroleum Institute showed that U.S. crude inventories rose by 851,000 barrels in the week to June 23 to 509.5 million, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.6 million barrels. Gasoline stocks rose by 1.4 million barrels, despite the ongoing peak demand U.S. summer driving season. The price falls come despite an ongoing effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January 2017 and March 2018. Ian Taylor, head of the world's largest independent oil trader Vitol, says Brent crude prices will stay in a range of $40-$55 a barrel for the next few quarters as higher U.S. production slows a rebalancing of the market.  Everybody was positioned for a market rebalancing and a stocks draw to happen in the second quarter. And if you look at the macro analysis, that should start happening,  Taylor said in an interview with Reuters.  But so far it hasn't happened and everyone has made the same mistake.

In November, U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson directed the State Department to reconsider its  binary-only gender passport policy,  in the case of Navy veteran Dan Zzyym, an “intersex” Colorado resident who sued the federal government for refusing to issue a passport because it requires an applicant to denote either male or female gender. After conducting its court-ordered review, the State Department last month again denied Zzyym’s application, according to a motion filed on the plaintiff's behalf by the Lambda Legal Defense Fund asking Jackson to reopen the case. In his original order to the State Department, Jackson declined to consider constitutional questions raised in Zzyym's lawsuit unless the issue could not be resolved administratively. Zzyym, born in 1958, sued in 2015 after being denied a passport to travel to Mexico for an international conference of intersex people - those born with anatomies that do not fit the typical definition of male or female. The lawsuit claims the State Department's policy violates due process and equal protections for Zzyym and other intersex people. Zzyym was raised as a boy and underwent several irreversible, painful and medically unnecessary surgeries before joining the U.S. Navy as a male, according to the lawsuit. It was only after returning to civilian life after six years in the military that Zzyym realized there were others who did not fit into traditional gender categories, the lawsuit says. The government did not oppose Tuesday's motion by Zzyym and on Tuesday Jackson agreed to revive the case. A spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. Zzyym, associate director for the Intersex Campaign for Equality, said in a statement that the government “is in effect forcing me to lie about who I am and I’m not going to do that.

Brooke Jackson directed the State Department to reconsider its  binary-only gender passport policy,  in the case of Navy veteran Dan Zzyym, an “intersex” Colorado resident who sued the federal government for refusing to issue a passport because it requires an applicant to denote either male or female gender. After conducting its court-ordered review, the State Department last month again denied Zzyym’s application, according to a motion filed on the plaintiff's behalf by the Lambda Legal Defense Fund asking Jackson to reopen the case. In his original order to the State Department, Jackson declined to consider constitutional questions raised in Zzyym's lawsuit unless the issue could not be resolved administratively. Zzyym, born in 1958, sued in 2015 after being denied a passport to travel to Mexico for an international conference of intersex people - those born with anatomies that do not fit the typical definition of male or female. The lawsuit claims the State Department's policy violates due process and equal protections for Zzyym and other intersex people. Zzyym was raised as a boy and underwent several irreversible, painful and medically unnecessary surgeries before joining the U.S. Navy as a male, according to the lawsuit. It was only after returning to civilian life after six years in the military that Zzyym realized there were others who did not fit into traditional gender categories, the lawsuit says. The government did not oppose Tuesday's motion by Zzyym and on Tuesday Jackson agreed to revive the case. A spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.

The report could further strain already frayed ties between Germany and Turkey, which are at loggerheads over a wide range of issues.  The Federal Criminal Police Office carried out so-called 'security discussions' with several members of parliament in recent weeks,  Die Welt reported.  The discussions reportedly centered on the possible surveillance of Turkish intelligence and security risks posed by Turkish nationalists.  The Federal Criminal Police Office was not immediately available to comment on the report. Germany's chief federal prosecutor in January launched an investigation into possible spying by clerics sent to Germany by the Turkish government, and in March opened a second, unrelated probe into suspected espionage. At the time, German media reports said the Turkish Intelligence Agency (MIT) was suspected of spying on supporters of U.S.-based cleric Fetullah Gulen, accused by Ankara of organizing a failed coup last July.  Ties between Germany and Turkey have been strained for more than a year over issues including the German parliament's approval of a resolution classifying the 1915 massacre of Armenians by Ottoman forces as a genocide; Berlin's criticism of a domestic security crackdown after the July coup; and Turkey's jailing of a German-Turkish journalist. Germany's parliament this month approved the planned withdrawal of troops from the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey after Ankara's refusal to allow German lawmakers access to German soldiers there. Turkey has also accused some German lawmakers of supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), a charge they reject.

Sori, who was arrested in 2011 on charges of aiding Maoist rebels in the state, accused the police of torturing and sexually assaulting her while in prison. The crime?  Defending the right of indigenous people to live in an area rich in minerals in what is one of India's poorest states. Police officials, who have since been moved to other locations, deny any mistreatment. Stirred by Sori's call for justice, Gera and a couple of other lawyers left Delhi to set up office in the state's restive Bastar region in 2013. It wasn't long before they were targets. The lawyers said they were followed, had objects thrown into their home, and accused of helping Maoist rebels. They say they were harassed for defending villagers and indigenous people.  They were finally evicted by a fearful landlord last year, and relocated to Bilaspur about 400 km (250 miles) away, where they continued to pursue their cases. Mineral-Rich, Rights-Poor The lawyers have angered plenty of people in high places. A top police official recently said they should be crushed on the highway for going against the state to protect villagers.  Parts of Chhattisgarh are like a war zone,  said Sudha Bharadwaj, a lawyer in Bilaspur who backed Gera and set up a legal aid group, Janhit, for farmers and indigenous people.  There is violence against people who insist on their rights and we are perceived as anti-development for helping them,  said Bharadwaj, 55, who took up law aged 40 to help local people. One of India's least developed states, Chhattisgarh sits atop some of India's biggest reserves of coal, iron ore, bauxite, dolomite, limestone, tin and gold, and accounts for nearly a fifth of the total value of minerals produced in India. At least 25 conflicts are raging in the state - over coal and iron ore, power projects and steel plants - and they affect 70,000 people, according to research firm Land Conflict Watch. The race for resources to spur India's economic growth has pitted some of its most vulnerable people against the state, stalling industrial projects worth billions of dollars. [nL8N1DF11U] There are at least 332 land conflicts nationwide, affecting more than 3.5 million people, according to Land Conflict Watch. Nowhere are these conflicts more violent and bloody than in Chhattisgarh, part of the  Red Corridor  stretching across eastern and central India that has witnessed a Maoist rebellion for more than three decades. The rebels, who say they are fighting for the land rights and empowerment of indigenous people, accuse the government of plundering mineral resources while ignoring the villagers. Adivasis, or  original dwellers , and lower-caste Dalits make up more than 40 percent of the state's 28 million population and traditionally lived in its forests and hills. After the opening of the economy in the early 1990s, tracts of forest land were handed to companies including Adani Group, Jindal Power, Essar and Tata Steel for mines and power plants. Backed by the state, an anti-insurgency militia called Salwa Judum - meaning 'Peace March' or 'Purification March' - began cracking down on the Maoist rebels from 2005 to free up land. A pitched battle ensued, in which hundreds were killed and tens of thousands displaced amid accusations of mass rape, illegal detentions, torture and extra-judicial killings. Activists are caught  between two sets of guns  in the conflict between Maoist combatants and government security forces, Human Rights Watch said in a 2012 report.  The original inhabitants are seen as road blocks that they have to get out of the way to do more mining, build more plants, more industry,  said Bharadwaj. Murder, Treason The fight for land and the environment is  a new battleground for human rights , according to British-based watchdog Global Witness, with India chalking up at least six deaths in 2015 related to land conflicts. [nL8N1DU0LB] In Chhattisgarh, villagers spoke of giving up land at gunpoint while activists faced charges from murder to treason. Lingaram Kodopi, a tribal activist, fled to Delhi after being shot in the leg in 2011. Binayak Sen, a physician, was convicted of treason and sedition in 2010 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Ramesh Agrawal, who received the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize in 2014 for leading a protest that shut down a proposed coal mine, was wounded by masked gunmen in 2012. Sori was attacked again last year with chemicals. Delhi University professor Nandini Sundar was among those charged last year in the killing of an indigenous man in Bastar shortly after she published a book on the conflict.  People opposing the state are not treated as citizens. The state sees it fit to tackle them only through the military,  said Gera, a co-founder of Jagdalpur Legal Aid Group.  Would there be less violence if there were no resources? Perhaps.  'Iron Fist' Laws that protect the rights of farmers and indigenous people - including a 1996 law on tribal areas and the 2006 Forest Rights Act giving traditional forest dwellers access to forest resources - are poorly implemented, activists say. Meanwhile state officials say resource-based industries are needed to spur growth and generate jobs for the state.  We have settled forest rights where requested. If there is any complaint of rights violation, we look into it,  said Subodh Kumar Singh, a senior official in the mines department.  There may be a few displacements, but the people are resettled. The industries are bringing good development.  The Supreme Court in 2011 called Salwa Judum  illegal  and ordered its disbandment. The top court said it was dismayed the only option for the state was  to rule with an iron fist .  But a battle is still raging. Among the cases that Bharadwaj is handling is that of Janki Sidar, who is fighting the unauthorized takeover of her land. The case is 14 years old. Bharadwaj is her 10th lawyer.      It is necessary for us - doctors, lawyers, journalists - to be involved,  said Bharadwaj.  We have to help them confront the power of the state and industry. We have to become their amplifiers to carry their voices to the outside world.

U.S. prosecutors have accused Shkreli, dubbed the  pharma bro,  of running a Ponzi-like scheme at his former hedge fund and a drug company he once ran. Shkreli has pleaded not guilty to charges of securities and wire fraud. The difficulty of finding a jury became apparent on Monday, with potential jurors variously describing Shkreli as  evil  and a  snake.  More jurors cited the length of the trial, expected to last up to six weeks, as a hardship. The ensuing headlines prompted Shkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, to ask U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn on Tuesday morning to declare a mistrial. She refused. The trouble continued Tuesday, as Matsumoto asked potential jurors left over from Monday whether they had been exposed to negative media reports about the previous day. Several who said they had were dismissed. Shkreli, 34, rose to fame in 2015 by raising the price of anti-parisitic drug Daraprim to $750 a pill, from $13.50, when he was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals. The move sparked outrage among patients and U.S. lawmakers. Shkreli's upcoming trial is not about Turing but about Shkreli's management at his previous drug company, Retrophin Inc, and the hedge fund MSMB Capital Management between 2009 and 2012. Prosecutors said Shkreli lied about MSMB's finances to lure investors and concealed devastating trading losses from them. They said he paid the investors back with money stolen from Retrophin, which he founded in 2011. Tuesday's jury questioning suggested Turing might come up anyway. One juror, a pharmacist, was dismissed after saying he was familiar with the company, and that he would compare any testimony about drug pricing to his own knowledge. Shkreli himself may have complicated the jury selection. While most criminal defendants lie low, he has sought public attention since his December 2015 arrest, lashing out at critics and boasting of his wealth on social media. He was banned from Twitter in January for harassing a journalist. One juror was dismissed on Tuesday after saying he was familiar with Shkreli's Twitter account.  Unfortunately, the Twitter history is just horrific,  Brafman said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-crime-shkreli-idUSL1N1JO26B"},

About $400 million of that total is destined for oil and gas exploration in the sprawling Vaca Muerta shale formation in Argentina's southern Patagonia region, the spokesman said in a telephone interview after government news site Telam reported the company's investment plan. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri has sought to attract investment to Vaca Muerta to help close Argentina's costly energy deficit since taking office in late 2015. Argentine Energy and Mining Minister Juan Jose Aranguren said in April that investment of between $6 billion and $8 billion had been confirmed in Vaca Muerta this year. Argentina's state-run oil company YPF SA said in February it would invest $2.3 billion in the shale field this year.

That is largely thanks to big investments in infrastructure from Beijing as the region - with its links to much of central Asia - is critical to Chinese  President Xi Jinping’s new Silk Road initiative. But traders, business owners and residents in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, are seeing little benefit from the central government's cash injection, according to about 20 interviews with people in the city. One major reason for that, they say, is due to tightened security as the Chinese government seeks to control one of its biggest domestic threats. Beijing accuses separatist extremists among the Muslim Uighur ethnic minority of plotting attacks on the ethnic Han majority in Xinjiang and other parts of China, following a series of violent events in recent years.  As a result, there are roadblocks and stringent security checks across the region, including at restaurants, hotels and shops, making it slow and frustrating to move around. The new Silk Road, officially known as the Belt and Road initiative, is Xi’s signature foreign and economic policy which aims to increase economic and political ties through roads, railways and other projects that link China to Central Asia and beyond. But the contrast between that ambition and the views at street level in Urumqi reflects the difficulty Beijing faces in trying to balance security against its other top priorities. This is particularly the case as China is determined to avoid any trouble ahead of a critical Communist Party congress in the autumn at which Xi is expected to consolidate his power, and as it faces the threat from some Uighurs who have become battle-hardened Islamic State fighters in the war in Syria and Iraq and may return home.        Deliveries Difficult The impact of the clampdown is clear at the Frontier International Trade Centre in Urumqi,  where padlocked stores outnumber traders.  Business became really bad last year. I've got nothing to do except a stock-take,  said Wei Chun, a shoe trader, surrounded by piles of high-heels. She blames poor sales partly on the impact of sluggish economies in neighbors Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, among the eight countries with which Xinjiang has borders.  But she also says the Chinese authorities’ obsession with keeping Xinjiang secure at all costs is making it tough to do business here.  It's very difficult to send and receive deliveries because of the security crackdown,” she said, complaining that authorities will often shut down the delivery system for “security reasons”. The Xinjiang government declined to make officials available for comment for this article. It also did not respond to a series of faxed questions. Xu Bin, the head of the Xinjiang government’s statistics bureau,  told reporters in February that its growth – which was 7.6 percent last year - is mostly fueled by fixed asset investment. But he then added: “Xinjiang faces slowing economic growth, falling industrial prices, companies are feeling the pain of falling profits and the growth rate of our tax revenue has dropped off.” Xinjiang's trade with other countries fell in the first quarter of this year, according to the customs bureau, and is still below the level it recorded in the first quarter of 2013, the year that Belt and Road launched.  Much of that drop was because a slump in the rouble in 2014-2015 hurt Xinjiang’s neighbors, and following the 2015 establishment of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). That aims to develop Central Asia and lessen its reliance on Chinese goods.

Group gatherings, whether for charity fun runs or trade expos, are often banned or canceled at the last minute, they say. Phone lines sometimes go dead, and there's no 4G internet because the authorities fear high-speed internet would help militants organize. While Belt and Road has created opportunities, small businesses complain these projects often reward large state-owned enterprises.  The Belt and Road Initiative doesn't help small businessmen like me,” said Zhou Bangquan who sells men's shoes in Urumqi. “It helps big state-owned enterprises that do energy or have big infrastructure projects.  Among the projects financed are a highway to Pakistan and a network of high-speed railroads connecting cities in Xinjiang and the rest of China, with 1.5 trillion yuan ($220 billion) in capital investment expected in the region this year alone. Slideshow (5 Images)But it is unclear how much of the money is used to buy materials from factories outside the region or ends up being sent to other provinces by workers brought in temporarily from elsewhere in China. It’s not just heightened security measures that concern businesses. People are required to attend flag ceremonies and other patriotic education, instead of working, say locals. Such events are meant to encourage Uighurs to become patriotic Chinese citizens but can also be used to monitor their behavior.      Patriotic Education  I'm losing my mind, I've already had six staff sent back to their hometowns this past month for study,  said a restaurant manager in Urumqi who, like many people Reuters spoke to in Xinjiang, declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. His Uighur staff were required to return home to southern Xinjiang for one month's study of Mandarin Chinese, another month learning about China's legal system and a month of vocational training, he said.  We all spend so much time doing things that aren't our actual jobs. I have to take my staff to watch a flag-raising forty weeks of the year. If I don't, I will be taken away for thirty days of study,  he said. As well as the time spent on such matters, Uighurs – who represent just over 45 percent of the population – are being increasingly marginalized by the Han Chinese, undermining the overall economy. Three Han Chinese entrepreneurs told Reuters local authorities had told them not to employ Uighurs. And a Han Chinese real estate agent in Urumqi said he had been told not to sell properties to Uighurs from southern Xinjiang. There has been a change in attitude towards balancing stability and economic growth in Xinjiang since Chen Quanguo became its new Communist Party boss last August in what analysts say was an implicit endorsement of his previous hard-line management of ethnic strife in Tibet.  Xinjiang used to have a policy of 'with one hand we maintain stability, with the other hand we grow the economy' but now it's just 'maintain stability with both hands, at all costs',  said a local businessman and former government official. Chen said in a speech last September that  all our work in Xinjiang revolves around maintaining a tight grip on stability.   Reporting by Sue-Lin Wong; Additional reporting by the Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Martin Howell","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-xinjiang-idUSKBN19I310"},

Three sources said it was a rift with family members over money and control of the Hong Kong company that played the decisive role in Okada's May 12 resignation as director of Okada Holdings Ltd. Okada Holdings owns 69 percent of Tokyo-listed Universal Entertainment Corp (6425.T), a maker of Japanese-style slot machines and operator of a $2.4 billion casino in the Philippines. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the rift has not been made public.   One of those people, who was briefed by senior executives on the matter, said Okada's son Tomohiro was upset with how his father was using Universal dividends allocated to Okada Holdings. That included, the son believed, purchasing pieces for Okada's art museum in Hakone, a resort town near Tokyo. Universal said it was not in a position to comment on the changes at its top shareholder.  Attempts to reach Okada at his address in Hong Kong were unsuccessful. David Krakoff, his lawyer in an unrelated U.S. lawsuit, did not respond to emails and calls seeking comment. The sources did not provide details of how Okada's family helped oust him as director of Okada Holdings. His resignation was confirmed in a corporate filing in Hong Kong. Okada's son Tomohiro holds 43.5 percent of Okada Holdings and his daughter Hiromi holds just under 10 percent - together enough to have the majority of shares needed to remove him under the terms of the company's founding documents.  Reuters was unable to determine if Okada's wife Takako, who owns a stake of less than 1 percent, played any role in the changes. Tomohiro, Hiromi and Takako did not respond to letters sent to addresses listed in public documents. Okada is set to lose his post as chairman of Universal after the company recently announced a slate of directors that omitted him - a move Universal said had the blessing of Okada Holdings. Shareholders will vote on that list of directors, which includes the reappointment of Takako, at Universal's annual meeting on Thursday. Okada was also recently dropped from the board of the company running Universal's casino on Manila Bay.  The boardroom shake-up was orchestrated in part by Universal President Jun Fujimoto, a company veteran whose relationship with Okada has grown increasingly strained over the years, according to people with knowledge of the recent changes and the relationship between the two men. Fujimoto, who is in charge of Universal's profitable business of developing pachinko and pachi-slot gambling machines for the Japanese market, has at times questioned the wisdom of Okada's costly push into the Philippine casino market, the people said.  Universal denied there was such tension between Fujimoto and Okada. In response to other questions it referred to a recently launched internal investigation into Okada's alleged misuse of company funds and noted that it had added an outside director in an effort to bolster oversight.  We are taking steps to further strengthen corporate governance,  Universal said in an emailed response.  Universal announced this month it was probing an alleged misappropriation of $20 million by Okada and another director. Okada has not commented on the allegations.     While out as director of Okada Holdings, Okada still owns a 46.4 percent stake in the company and retains a grip over other parts of his empire, including a 100 percent stake in Aruze Gaming America, which manufacturers slot machines and is licensed in several U.S. states. Separate from the recent allegations, Okada and his companies have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation over a $40 million payment to a Manila-based consultant in 2010. The FBI's probe is focused on whether the payment was aimed at helping Universal gain tax and ownership concessions for the casino from the Philippine government, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Universal and Okada have denied any wrongdoing and filed a defamation lawsuit against Reuters in 2012 for its reporting on the payments. The Tokyo District Court ruled in 2015 that Universal's case was without merit. Last year the Tokyo High Court upheld that ruling, dismissing Universal's appeal. Universal has appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan.

Chen said in a speech last September that  all our work in Xinjiang revolves around maintaining a tight grip on stability.   Reporting by Sue-Lin Wong; Additional reporting by the Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Martin Howell","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-xinjiang-idUSL3N1J41KQ"},

Committee members declined to comment on the discussion to reporters as they left the panel's secure hearing room. Podesta stopped and commented briefly.  They asked me to come forward to give to the best of my knowledge what I knew about that, and I was happy to cooperate with the committee in their investigation of Russian interference with the democratic process in the United States,  he said. Republican President Donald Trump, who defeated Clinton in the election, recently has accused former Democratic President Barack Obama of doing too little to address Russian cyber attacks while he was still in the White House. On Monday, Trump demanded on Twitter that investigators apologize for looking to Russian interference and possible collusion with his campaign. He accused Obama of having  colluded or obstructed,  without providing evidence. [nL1N1JN12O] Asked whether he thought Obama had done enough, Podesta said,  I think the president and the entire administration were dealing with an unprecedented incidence of the weaponization of the fruits of Russian cyber activity and making the best judgments they could on behalf of the American people.  During the 2016 campaign, hackers penetrated the Democratic National Committee's email server and separately stole emails from Podesta's personal account. The emails were then posted online and used to embarrass Clinton, including by Trump, who frequently used their content as political ammunition. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia was behind the hacking and that it was seeking to boost Trump's chances of winning the White House. Russia has denied trying to influence the election, and Trump has dismissed such allegations as sour grapes by Democrats and their supporters unable to come to terms with his surprise victory in November. The House intelligence panel is conducting one of several investigations into Russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with members of Trump's campaign, as is Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller.[nL1N1IC249] The House panel began bringing in witnesses for interviews this week, and a few more are expected before lawmakers leave Washington by Friday for their weeklong July 4 holiday recess.

An impasse between Governor Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has left Illinois without complete budgets for an unprecedented two-straight fiscal years. The nearly $36.5 billion general funds budget was the first spending blueprint offered by House Speaker Michael Madigan for the fiscal year that begins Saturday.  Illinois still has a trek to get to a full-year budget and avoid being the first U.S. state to have its credit rating downgraded to junk.  “I’m not saying this is perfect,  Madigan told reporters in the state capitol of the Democrats' proposal.  I’m not saying it completely meets every request of the governor. But I think it goes a long way to giving the state of Illinois a good solid spending plan that responds to the real needs of the state.” But House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, whose members' votes will be required to reach a three-fifths majority vote threshold, said his caucus could not judge that budget without seeing a companion revenue bill.   Based on Democrats' past action, I can't take their word this is a balanced budget,  he told reporters. State Representative Greg Harris, Madigan's point person on the budget, said House Democrats' goal was  to live within the confines  of a revenue bill the Senate passed last month. That measure, which passed with only Democratic votes, would boost revenue by $5.5 billion by permanently raising the flat personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent and the corporate tax to 7 percent from 5.25 percent, eliminating corporate tax loopholes, and expanding the state sales tax to certain services such as dry cleaning and storage facilities. Durkin said his members want to tie the longevity of any tax hike to the duration of a local property tax freeze. While House Democrats have offered a four-year freeze, it was unclear how long higher tax rates would stay in place. “They will not show their cards on that,  Durkin said. He also questioned Madigan's plan to hold votes Wednesday on Democrat-drafted legislation aimed at satisfying Rauner's demands for reforms, saying it was  not healthy  for the process. Senate Democrats last month passed their own budget, which mirrors Rauner's $37.3 billion spending target.

Loeb,Jean,Philippe Bertschy,John Martin Miller,Jon Cox,Mark Schneider,Michael Flaherty,Ulf M. Schneider,US,NESTLE,THIRDPOINT,United States","sector":"Business","content":"LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (NESN.S) plans to buy back as much as 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.8 billion) worth of shares over three years, it said on Tuesday, days after U.S. activist shareholder Third Point LLC began a campaign to boost performance at the company. The New York-based hedge fund, controlled by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in the company on Sunday when it started pushing for Nestle to more aggressively boost performance and buy back shares. Nestle, maker of Gerber baby food and Perrier water, said its announcement was the result of a review of its priorities that had begun in early 2017. It did not mention Third Point in its statement, and Third Point declined to comment on the announcement. However, Nestle's Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who took over at the start of the year, said at the company's first-quarter results presentation in April that he understood from meetings with shareholders they wanted to see  meaningful steps towards improved combinations of growth rates and margins . These comments and the fact that buyback plans take time to get regulatory approval before being announced mean that Nestle would have submitted the plan before Third Point made its position public late on Sunday.  Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said there was no big surprise in the company's statement, but it had initially planned to release this at its investor day in September. It was not clear, however, whether feedback that Loeb might have given in a meeting earlier this month was taken into consideration when Nestle crafted the final buyback plan, which will start on July 4.  Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy did not see the announcement as a direct result of Third Point.  We rather see today's announcement as a thorough strategic review triggered by CEO Mark Schneider, approved by the board,  he said, noting that this was Nestle's second-biggest buyback following 25 billion Swiss francs in 2007. The company has bought back 47 billion francs worth of shares since 2005.  In the context of low interest rates and strong cash flow generation, share buybacks offer a viable option to create shareholder value,  the company said. The volume of monthly share buybacks will depend on market conditions but will probably occur mostly in 2019 and 2020, so Nestle can consider acquisitions before then, it said.      The company now expects to increase its level of debt to about 1.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by 2020. That would be up from about 0.8 times last year.  Hopes of Change  Nestle shares had jumped 4 percent on Monday, adding some $10 billion in market value before falling 1.6 percent on Tuesday, on hopes the push by Third Point would speed up changes under Schneider, who joined the company last year and took over as CEO in January. On Tuesday, Nestle said it will focus any capital spending on high-growth food and beverage categories including coffee, petcare, infant nutrition and bottled water, as well as growth opportunities in consumer healthcare. FILE PHOTO: Daniel S. Loeb, founder of Third Point LLC, participates in a panel discussion during the Skybridge Alternatives (SALT) Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada May 9, 2012.Steve Marcus/File PhotoIt said this month's announcement that it may sell its U.S. confectionery business was consistent with that approach. It also recently formed a joint venture with R&R; Ice Cream to manage its ice cream business.    The company will continue to adjust its portfolio in line with its strategy and growth objectives,  Nestle said. There are other parts of Nestle's business that analysts have speculated could be sold, including its U.S. frozen food business. Billions of dollars worth of assets are up for grabs as the global packaged food industry adapts to change. For example, Unilever (ULVR.L) is selling its margarine and spreads business and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) is selling its mustard business. Kepler's Cox said the fact that the company said it was targeting spending in consumer healthcare meant  it could be seen on the prowl for assets like Johnson and Johnson's consumer health as well as Bayer's consumer health business . Too Big to Shake?   The pressure placed on the world's largest food group, Europe's most valuable company, shatters perceptions that the Swiss giant with over 2,000 brands is too big to shake up. CEO Schneider, who had met Loeb this month, seemed to hint at that last week when he told a conference in Berlin:  Size alone does not protect you from the winds of change.  Coupled with a shock $143 billion takeover bid from Kraft Heinz for Unilever in February, it shows the impatience of some investors about how multinationals are adapting to change. Loeb, who has taken on giants such as Yahoo and Sony (6758.T), has argued that even though Nestle has exposure to promising categories such as coffee and pet food, its shares have underperformed rivals in recent years as it has  remained stuck in its old ways .  It is rare to find a business of Nestle's quality with so many avenues for improvement,  Loeb said in the letter to the fund's investors.  Nestle should set a target for margin growth to improve productivity, double its leverage to fund share buybacks, shed non-core assets and sell the 23 percent stake it owns in French cosmetics group L'Oreal (OREP.PA), he said. Whereas Unilever and Danone have recently set margin targets for 2020, Nestle has not. It has announced a productivity program to save 1.8 billion Swiss francs by 2020, but has not yet said how much of that would fall to the bottom line. Analysts have said that Schneider, who will lay out his strategy at an investor event in September, had already seemed more open to listening to the concerns of longtime shareholders, many of which were echoed by Third Point.   Daniel Hauselmann, head of Swiss equities at GAM Investment Management, said much of what Third Point suggested was already being done.   Nestle is no sleeping giant that does not look after its shareholders,  he told Reuters.  I think Nestle should stick to its strategy.

Still, the timing of the announcement suggests that pressure brought to bear by the activist investor, who has taken on giants including Yahoo and Sony Corp, may have played a role.  The timing of Nestle's announcement gives the impression that management has been cowed or bullied by an activist investor owning 1.3 percent of the company,  said Bernstein analysts, in a reference to Loeb.

The ailing Japanese conglomerate is rushing to sell the prized unit to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit. It had promised to sign a definitive agreement with a preferred bidder by Wednesday's meeting. But the preferred bidder, a group led by Japanese government investors and including U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, has not agreed on conditions of the deal, two sources familiar with the talks said. They requested anonymity as the negotiations were confidential. Some Toshiba board members are also concerned about technology leaks to South Korean chip rival SK Hynix Inc , which plans to join the Bain group by providing financing, two sources said this week. An ongoing legal dispute with Toshiba's chip partner Western Digital Corp could also derail the $18 billion sale as the U.S. company has sought a court injunction to block any deal that does not have its consent. Toshiba's top executives are expected to apologise to shareholders for failing to present audited annual results after a prolonged accounting investigation at Westinghouse. Last week, it flagged a net loss of around $9 billion for the year ended in March with negative shareholders' equity of around $5.2 billion, both worse than expected. Toshiba shares are set to be demoted to the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange from Aug. 1, the latest in a series of humiliating developments for a company in business for more than 140 years.

Any fiscal slippage would mean Japan keeping its money printing presses running longer, and would break a commitment to G20 countries.  That could risk provoking fresh accusations of currency manipulation from the United States and other G20 countries if they saw Japan's move as a further attempt to keep the yen weak. Abe also has to be careful of the potential market reaction. Any reduction in the commitment to whittling down a public debt,  that at twice the size of the economy is the worst among major economies, could risk damaging investor confidence in Japan. While Abe is unlikely to have decided yet on whether to proceed with a scheduled sales tax hike in 2019, there are plenty of reasons to postpone it, the government sources say. Abe's aides say the premier, who twice delayed a hike to 10 percent after an increase to 8 percent in 2014 pushed Japan to the verge of recession, won't risk cooling the economy again.  I think the prime minister understands that putting off the sales tax hike is in the best interest of fiscal consolidation,  said Satoshi Fujii, a special adviser to Abe. Imf Blessing  Having seen his support slump from a series of scandals, Abe must decide whether to move ahead with the tax hike by mid-next year - around the time he could call a general election that must be held by late 2018. But, even the International Monetary Fund said last week that sustaining economic growth should take priority over consolidating the budget for now.  What's most important is to maintain growing momentum in the economy so that growth becomes sustained,  IMF Deputy Managing Director David Lipton told Reuters on Monday.  It's a good time to make sure that there's not a premature consolidation that halts the economy,  he said after annual Article 4 consultations with Japan. Having notched five straight quarters of growth, Japan's economy is on its best run in a decade, but it is hardly impressive. Growth in the first quarter of this year was an annualized 1.0 percent, and the economy face numerous structural challenges, notably over-reliance on exports, slow wage growth handicapping domestic demand, and an aging population. Abe came to power in 2012 promising to wrench Japan's economy out of nearly two decades of deflation, but the jury is still out on whether he is succeeding. With that in mind, Abe has repeatedly said Japan should fix its finances by boosting growth and tax revenues, rather than resorting to fiscal austerity steps, and has set a target to raise Japan's nominal gross domestic product (GDP) to 600 trillion yen. Shifting Goalposts Rather than risk a market backlash, the government kept a reference to the budget-balance target in its annual fiscal guidelines for this year, even though sources say there is a near-consensus in the administration that it won't be met.  But in the clearest sign yet that Abe was back-tracking on the budget goal, the guidelines - announced on June 9 - also included a pledge to simultaneously lower the debt-to-GDP ratio, which could help save face over any slippage on fiscal reform. The debt-to-GDP ratio is easier to meet as it improves as long as nominal GDP grows more than borrowing costs, and those can be contained by the Bank of Japan's ultra-easy policy, the government sources said.  Even if the budget-balance cannot be achieved, the government can argue it passed the grade if the debt-to-GDP ratio improves temporarily,  said one of the sources. This year's guidelines also made no mention of the need to raise the sales tax, contrary to past years when the government referred to it as key to restoring fiscal health.  There wasn't even discussion on the tax hike in government panels,  one source said. Another source said the reference may have been removed to give Abe room to delay the tax hike. Abe's aide Fujii said such changes to the guidelines meant the government is no longer committed to the budget-balance target and will instead focus on lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio.  You could say the government is obligated to increase spending by 3 to 4 percent this year and next year, because it is targeting a 600-trillion-yen economy,  said Fujii, a professor at Kyoto University. Watering down the fiscal target is not without risks. The Bank of Japan could be forced to delay its exit from a massive stimulus, the sources say. That, in turn, could provoke fresh allegations of currency manipulation from U.S. President Donald Trump, and leaders of other G20 countries.  There would be criticism from the G20, because the economic impact would be the same as bankrolling government spending and influencing the currency,  Akihiko Noda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, said.  Japan shouldn't take the G20 lightly.

At a closely watched first meeting between the two, Trump and Modi appeared to get along well. Modi pulled in Trump for a bear hug on the stage as the cameras rolled in the Rose Garden. “I deeply appreciate your strong commitment to the enhancement of our bilateral relations,  Modi told him.  I am sure that under your leadership a mutually beneficial strategic partnership will gain new strength, new positivity, and will reach new heights.” Trump was also warm but made clear he sees a need for more balance in the U.S.-India trade relationship in keeping with his campaign promise to expand American exports and create more jobs at home. Last year the U.S. trade deficit with India neared $31 billion. Trump said he would like a trading relationship that is  fair and reciprocal.    It is important that barriers be removed to the export of U.S. goods into your markets and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country,  he said. Trump said he was pleased about an Indian airline’s recent order of 100 new American planes and that the United States looked forward to exporting more energy, including major long-term contracts to purchase American natural gas. These energy contracts  are being negotiated and we will sign – trying to get the price up a little bit,  Trump said. Modi came to Washington looking to revitalize a relationship that thrived under former President Barack Obama but has appeared to flag as Trump courted India's rival China in an effort to persuade Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea. Modi effusively praised Trump, hailing his “vast and successful experience in the business world” and “great leadership” for U.S.-India ties, which he said should “lend an aggressive and forward looking agenda to our relations.” Related CoverageTrump, Modi call North Korea's 'grave threat' to peace: White HouseTrump, India's Modi call on Pakistan to stem terrorist attacksTrump accepted Modi's invitation to visit India, the White House said in a statement, but no time frame was given for the trip. Modi harked back to Trump's  Make America Great Again  campaign slogan to stress that his agenda for his country was little different than Trump's.  I am sure that the convergence of my vision for  New India  and President Trump’s vision for making America great again will add new dimensions to our cooperation,  he said. Trump did not mention U.S. differences with India on immigration and the Paris climate accord.  The future of our partnership has never looked brighter,  Trump said as both leaders underscored the importance of the defense and security relationship. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugs U.S. President Donald Trump as he departures the White House after a visit, in Washington, U.S., June 26, 2017.Carlos BarriaAviation Deals As they met, a Pentagon agency said the U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to India of a Boeing C-17 transport aircraft with an estimated cost of $366 million. The United States also has offered to sell a naval variant of the Predator drone made by U.S. defense contractor General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, the White House said in a statement, a deal that would be worth more than $2 billion. The United States has become the leading supplier of defense equipment to India, signing contracts worth more than $15 billion since 2008. On Monday evening, Trump and Modi had a working dinner, the first time Trump has played host to a foreign dignitary at a White House dinner. Slideshow (15 Images)Trump administration officials have pointed to both leaders' impact on social media - each has more than 30 million Twitter followers - as proof they are cut from the same cloth.  If the chemistry is good, everything else gets sorted,  said an Indian official.  The only way is up. How much up we go depends on the leaders. If they click, we go up higher.  Trade, however, remains an irritant, and on Saturday, leading U.S. congressmen complained in a letter to Trump that high-level engagement had failed to eliminate major barriers to U.S. imports and investment and had not deterred India from imposing new ones. Indian officials reject suggestions that Modi's  Make in India  platform is protectionist and complain about the U.S. regulatory process for generic pharmaceuticals and rules on fruit imports. They stress the future importance of the huge Indian market to U.S. firms and major growth in areas such as aviation which will offer significant opportunities for U.S. manufacturers. Among the Indian business executives in Washington for Modi's visit was Ajay Singh, chairman of Indian budget airline SpiceJet, which in January announced a deal to buy up to 205 aircraft from Boeing, worth up to $22 billion at list prices. Singh told Reuters that according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the deal would sustain up to 132,000 jobs.  The market is growing 20-25 percent a year. Even at today’s pace you need 100 more planes a year just to keep pace with the market and we are not getting anywhere close to that number.  “As our economy grows ... we can potentially create a lot of jobs for Americans in the United States,” he said. Boeing has estimated India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel.

Picard announced the settlements with British Virgin Islands-based Lagoon and Bermuda-based Thema one day after revealing more than $23 million of settlements with the estates of Madoff's late sons Andrew and Mark, and entities affiliated with the Madoff family. Lagoon and Thema were among many feeder funds that sent customers' money, often without their knowledge, to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.

Like many other former Madoff customers that settled with Picard, Lagoon and Thema will be entitled to share in distributions from the Madoff firm's liquidation. Picard had previously recovered more than $11.6 billion for Madoff customers who he estimates lost $17.5 billion.

Temer, who was charged Monday night with arranging to receive millions of dollars in bribes, said the move would hurt Brazil's economic recovery and possibly paralyze efforts at reform. The conservative leader said executives of the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS SA , who accused him in plea-bargain testimony of arranging to take 38 million reais ($11.47 million) in bribes in the coming months, did so only to escape jail for their own crimes.   I have been charged with taking bribes without ever having received a cent,  Temer said in a nationally televised speech.  I've never seen any of that money and I have never taken part in planning to commit any crimes.  He added:  I tell you, my friends, without any fear of error, that this charge is a fiction.  Under Brazilian law, now that Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot has charged Temer, it is up to the House of Deputies to vote on whether or not to allow the Supreme Court to try the leader, who replaced impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff last year. Two-thirds of the lower house must vote against Temer for his trial to occur. Temer's allies in the lower house say they have the votes needed to block the charge. But Janot is widely expected to level fresh charges of racketeering and obstruction of justice against Temer in the coming weeks, forcing lawmakers into multiple votes on a possible presidential trial.  Several top lawmakers allied with the ruling coalition have told Reuters they are concerned that multiple votes to protect a deeply unpopular leader could erode his support, eventually prying open the door to a trial. A full house vote on the first charge is expected to take place in about a month. Brazilian President Michel Temer speaks during a press statement at Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil June 27, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoKey to Temer's survival is whether the Social Democracy Party (PSDB), Brazil's third largest, will stick with his coalition or bolt. The party is deeply divided, with many members wanting to distance themselves from Temer to improve their re-election chances next year. PSDB deputy Caio Narcio said political stability and turning around the economy were more important than removing Temer, and that he could not turn his back on the country at this critical moment.  The suffering and the crisis are too acute for a party to focus on its projects only,  he said, emphasizing that lawmakers needed to unify to get Temer's economic reforms approved.   Slideshow (2 Images)But PSDB deputy Daniel Coelho said many of the PSDB's 54 deputies could vote against Temer.   I cannot see the argument against opening a trial, from a moral or ethical point of view,  he said. If a case against Temer were taken up by the Supreme Court,  the president would be removed from office for at least 180 days, leaving House speaker Rodrigo Maia to serve as the country's interim leader. Temer, whose government has an approval rating in the single digits, has already resisted repeated opposition calls to resign. But if he were found guilty, Congress would then choose someone to lead the nation through the remainder of his term, which ends on Jan. 1, 2019. The charge against Temer was widely expected and investors were calm on Tuesday. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index was down 0.8 percent and the local currency slipped 0.6 percent in late afternoon trading.  Investigators have uncovered corruption at all levels of Brazil's political class and business elites in recent years. Much of it centers on companies paying billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives at state-run enterprises in return for lucrative contracts.  Temer and one-third of his cabinet, as well as four former presidents and dozens of lawmakers are under investigation or already charged in the schemes. Over 90 people have been convicted.

As part of the Cook County Circuit Court lawsuit, the Illinois Retail Merchants Association is seeking an injunction preventing enforcement of the law and a declaration that it is invalid.  This ordinance is incomplete and it's a perfect example of the disaster that awaits when policies are hurried through without serious thought to how they might impact the businesses that have to try to comply with these policies,  the retailer association's president, Rob Karr, said in a statement. The Cook County Board of Commissioners passed the tax last November. It applies to all bottled sweetened beverages, including soda, sports drinks and energy drinks. Cook County, which includes Chicago and its surroundings, joined a growing number of localities that have adopted measures to cut consumption of sugary drinks for health reasons, including Seattle, Philadelphia and San Francisco. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle's spokesman, Frank Shuftan, said in an email that county officials are still reviewing the lawsuit and they intend to  aggressively defend  the ordinance in court. Preckwinkle previously lauded the tax as a benefit to public health and a necessary way to increase revenue. Officials with the Cook County Department of Revenue, which the association also named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment. The state retail organization, which represents more than 20,000 stores, asserted in the lawsuit that the county's penny-per-ounce beverage tax violates the state constitution by imposing different taxes on similar beverage products. For example, a packaged sweetened ice tea would be subject to the tax, while a similar drink served from behind the counter would not, the complaint said.

The study by a Mines and Energy Ministry research arm, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, recommended that Brazil's state-owned oil firm cap gas purchases from Bolivia's Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos SA at 16 million cubic meters a day of gas. Petrobras, which financed and built the pipeline on both sides of the border and is the exclusive Brazilian distributor of Bolivian gas, is allowed to buy up to 30.1 million cubic meters of gas per day under the terms of its current contract with YPFB. That contract expires in 2019. The study argues that the 14 million cubic meters a day in additional gas could be made available to other companies through an expansion of the market in states like São Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. The ministry did not have a comment on the study. Brazil and Bolivia have locked horns for about a decade over their gas dealings. Brazil has sought ways to cut its dependence on purchases of Bolivian gas since Bolivian President Evo Morales seized Petrobras' gas assets in May 2006. In February, Petrobras said it had cut gas imports from Bolivia to about 45 percent of the daily maximum volume established with YPFB, due to falling demand and rising domestic supply. That drove Bolivia to seek new Brazilian buyers. Bolivia began supplying natural gas to Brazil in 1999 through the Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline commonly known as Gasbol.

Three sources said it was a rift with family members over money and control of the Hong Kong company that played the decisive role in Okada's May 12 resignation as director of Okada Holdings Ltd. Okada Holdings owns 69 percent of Tokyo-listed Universal Entertainment Corp (6425.T), a maker of Japanese-style slot machines and operator of a $2.4 billion casino in the Philippines. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the rift has not been made public.   One of those people, who was briefed by senior executives on the matter, said Okada's son Tomohiro was upset with how his father was using Universal dividends allocated to Okada Holdings. That included, the son believed, purchasing pieces for Okada's art museum in Hakone, a resort town near Tokyo. Universal said it was not in a position to comment on the changes at its top shareholder.  Attempts to reach Okada at his address in Hong Kong were unsuccessful. David Krakoff, his lawyer in an unrelated U.S. lawsuit, did not respond to emails and calls seeking comment. The sources did not provide details of how Okada's family helped oust him as director of Okada Holdings. His resignation was confirmed in a corporate filing in Hong Kong. Okada's son Tomohiro holds 43.5 percent of Okada Holdings and his daughter Hiromi holds just under 10 percent - together enough to have the majority of shares needed to remove him under the terms of the company's founding documents.  Reuters was unable to determine if Okada's wife Takako, who owns a stake of less than 1 percent, played any role in the changes. Tomohiro, Hiromi and Takako did not respond to letters sent to addresses listed in public documents. Okada is set to lose his post as chairman of Universal after the company recently announced a slate of directors that omitted him - a move Universal said had the blessing of Okada Holdings. Shareholders will vote on that list of directors, which includes the reappointment of Takako, at Universal's annual meeting on Thursday. Okada was also recently dropped from the board of the company running Universal's casino on Manila Bay.  The boardroom shake-up was orchestrated in part by Universal President Jun Fujimoto, a company veteran whose relationship with Okada has grown increasingly strained over the years, according to people with knowledge of the recent changes and the relationship between the two men. Fujimoto, who is in charge of Universal's profitable business of developing pachinko and pachi-slot gambling machines for the Japanese market, has at times questioned the wisdom of Okada's costly push into the Philippine casino market, the people said.  Universal denied there was such tension between Fujimoto and Okada. In response to other questions it referred to a recently launched internal investigation into Okada's alleged misuse of company funds and noted that it had added an outside director in an effort to bolster oversight.  We are taking steps to further strengthen corporate governance,  Universal said in an emailed response.  Universal announced this month it was probing an alleged misappropriation of $20 million by Okada and another director. Okada has not commented on the allegations.     While out as director of Okada Holdings, Okada still owns a 46.4 percent stake in the company and retains a grip over other parts of his empire, including a 100 percent stake in Aruze Gaming America, which manufacturers slot machines and is licensed in several U.S. states. Separate from the recent allegations, Okada and his companies have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation over a $40 million payment to a Manila-based consultant in 2010. The FBI's probe is focused on whether the payment was aimed at helping Universal gain tax and ownership concessions for the casino from the Philippine government, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Universal and Okada have denied any wrongdoing and filed a defamation lawsuit against Reuters in 2012 for its reporting on the payments. The Tokyo District Court ruled in 2015 that Universal's case was without merit. Last year the Tokyo High Court upheld that ruling, dismissing Universal's appeal. Universal has appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan.

Temer, who was charged Monday night with arranging to receive millions of dollars in bribes, said the move would hurt Brazil's economic recovery and possibly paralyze efforts at reform. The conservative leader said executives of the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS SA , who accused him in plea-bargain testimony of arranging to take 38 million reais ($11.47 million) in bribes in the coming months, did so only to escape jail for their own crimes.   I have been charged with taking bribes without ever having received a cent,  Temer said in a nationally televised speech.  I've never seen any of that money and I have never taken part in planning to commit any crimes.  He added:  I tell you, my friends, without any fear of error, that this charge is a fiction.  Under Brazilian law, now that Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot has charged Temer, it is up to the House of Deputies to vote on whether or not to allow the Supreme Court to try the leader, who replaced impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff last year. Two-thirds of the lower house must vote against Temer for his trial to occur. Temer's allies in the lower house say they have the votes needed to block the charge. But Janot is widely expected to level fresh charges of racketeering and obstruction of justice against Temer in the coming weeks, forcing lawmakers into multiple votes on a possible presidential trial.  Several top lawmakers allied with the ruling coalition have told Reuters they are concerned that multiple votes to protect a deeply unpopular leader could erode his support, eventually prying open the door to a trial. A full house vote on the first charge is expected to take place in about a month. Brazilian President Michel Temer speaks during a press statement at Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil June 27, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoKey to Temer's survival is whether the Social Democracy Party (PSDB), Brazil's third largest, will stick with his coalition or bolt. The party is deeply divided, with many members wanting to distance themselves from Temer to improve their re-election chances next year. PSDB deputy Caio Narcio said political stability and turning around the economy were more important than removing Temer, and that he could not turn his back on the country at this critical moment.  The suffering and the crisis are too acute for a party to focus on its projects only,  he said, emphasizing that lawmakers needed to unify to get Temer's economic reforms approved.   Slideshow (2 Images)But PSDB deputy Daniel Coelho said many of the PSDB's 54 deputies could vote against Temer.   I cannot see the argument against opening a trial, from a moral or ethical point of view,  he said. If a case against Temer were taken up by the Supreme Court,  the president would be removed from office for at least 180 days, leaving House speaker Rodrigo Maia to serve as the country's interim leader. Temer, whose government has an approval rating in the single digits, has already resisted repeated opposition calls to resign. But if he were found guilty, Congress would then choose someone to lead the nation through the remainder of his term, which ends on Jan. 1, 2019. The charge against Temer was widely expected and investors were calm on Tuesday. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index was down 0.8 percent and the local currency slipped 0.6 percent in late afternoon trading.  Investigators have uncovered corruption at all levels of Brazil's political class and business elites in recent years. Much of it centers on companies paying billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives at state-run enterprises in return for lucrative contracts.  Temer and one-third of his cabinet, as well as four former presidents and dozens of lawmakers are under investigation or already charged in the schemes. Over 90 people have been convicted.

The 430-page report, released on Tuesday, had been under wraps since being completed by FIFA's then-ethics investigator Michael Garcia in November 2014. FIFA chose to publish after the document was leaked to the German newspaper Bild. Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup and Qatar the 2022 tournament in a single, secret vote in Zurich in December, 2010. After persistent allegations of illegitimate attempts to influence the 22 voting FIFA executive committee members, Garcia was asked to investigate. In November 2014, his completed report was handed to the FIFA ethics judge at the time, Hans-Joachim Eckert, whose 42-page summary that said there was not enough evidence to re-open the bidding process. Nevertheless, the lack of transparency surrounding the bidding for two major global sporting showpieces prompted closer investigation of FIFA affairs that led to the indictment of a host of senior officials and the eventual resignation and banning of FIFA president Sepp Blatter. On Russia, Garcia said that Vladimir Putin, then Russia's prime minister and now president, had actively supported his country's bid and had a significant presence, but that  there is no apparent violation of the FIFA rules of conduct in this regard .  There is no evidence in this record to suggest that the Russia bid committee attempted to exert undue influence on any FIFA executive committee members in order to secure their votes,  Garcia added. On Qatar, Garcia wrote:  To the extent this report identifies conduct by Qatar 2022 that may not have met the standards set out in the FIFA code of ethics or the bid rules, culpability is mitigated by the fact that these issues were uncovered largely as a result of its cooperation.  The report said Blatter, who has denied any wrongdoing, bore  some responsibility for a flawed process that engendered deep public scepticism , though it also praised him for implementing reforms including those that made the report itself possible. In the running alongside Russia to stage the 2018 World Cup were England and joint bids from Spain/Portugal and the Netherlands/Belgium. Qatar's rivals for the 2022 tournament were Australia, Japan, the United States and South Korea. The Swiss attorney general's office used Garcia's report as the basis for a criminal investigation into the award of the tournaments that is still continuing. Blatter stepped down in 2015 and was subsequently banned from soccer for six years following an internal ethics investigation.

As part of the Cook County Circuit Court lawsuit, the Illinois Retail Merchants Association is seeking an injunction preventing enforcement of the law and a declaration that it is invalid.   This ordinance is incomplete and it's a perfect example of the disaster that awaits when policies are hurried through without serious thought to how they might impact the businesses that have to try to comply with these policies,  the retailer association's president, Rob Karr, said in a statement.  The Cook County Board of Commissioners passed the tax last November. It applies to all bottled sweetened beverages, including soda, sports drinks and energy drinks. Cook County, which includes Chicago and its surroundings, joined a growing number of localities that have adopted measures to cut consumption of sugary drinks for health reasons, including Seattle, Philadelphia and San Francisco. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle's spokesman, Frank Shuftan, said in an email that county officials are still reviewing the lawsuit and they intend to  aggressively defend  the ordinance in court. Preckwinkle previously lauded the tax as a benefit to public health and a necessary way to increase revenue. Officials with the Cook County Department of Revenue, which the association also named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment.  The state retail organization, which represents more than 20,000 stores, asserted in the lawsuit that the county's penny-per-ounce beverage tax violates the state constitution by imposing different taxes on similar beverage products.  For example, a packaged sweetened ice tea would be subject to the tax, while a similar drink served from behind the counter would not, the complaint said.     The tax also makes retailers vulnerable to becoming ineligible for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, according to the complaint, because the program prohibits purchasing food that has a state or local sales tax. The program provides food benefits for millions of U.S. low-income individuals and families.

The indictments stem from a 2014 incident in which Laquan McDonald, 17, was shot to death. A video of the shooting, released in 2015, sparked days of protests and thrust Chicago into a national debate over the use of excessive force by police against minorities. Detective David March and officers Joseph Walsh and Thomas Gaffney were each charged with conspiracy, official misconduct and obstruction of justice, the special prosecutor, Patricia Brown Holmes, said.  The indictment makes clear that these defendants did more than merely obey an unofficial 'code of silence,' rather it alleges that they lied about what occurred to prevent independent criminal investigators from learning the truth,  Holmes said in a statement. A police union spokesman declined to comment. It was not immediately known if March, Walsh and Gaffney had hired attorneys. A lawyer for the McDonald family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  All three officers were on scene the night of the shooting, Holmes told reporters. Chicago police representatives said Walsh and March are no longer with the force and that Gaffney will be suspended without pay. The three officers conspired to conceal the true facts surrounding McDonald's killing in order to protect their fellow officer from criminal investigation and prosecution, the indictment said. They lied about what happened and mischaracterized the video recordings, which they knew would lead to a criminal investigation and likely criminal charges, it said. Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago police officer accused of murder in the McDonald shooting, was charged in March with 16 new counts of aggravated battery. Van Dyke pleaded not guilty to the 16 counts. He pleaded not guilty to murder in 2015 and is awaiting trial. When asked if others might face charges, Holmes said the matter is still being investigated. March, 58, and Walsh, 48, were police veterans of more than 30 years and about 20 years, respectively. Gaffney, 43, has about 20 years in the department. All are expected to be arraigned on July 10.

In an interview with Reuters in April, Trump called the  five-year-old KORUS trade pact  horrible  and  unacceptable  and said he would either renegotiate or terminate it. U.S. Chamber of Commerce executive vice president Myron Brilliant said U.S. exports to South Korea had not risen as much as expected and the U.S. trade deficit had grown, but these we not reasons to end the agreement.  Such a rash move would be a mistake,  Brilliant said in an op-ed article published on Tuesday, a day before Moon is due in Washington. Moon will speak at the chamber on Wednesday evening.

With more South Korean tariffs set for elimination over the next few years, U.S. exports would be even more competitive.  In addition, Brilliant wrote, KORUS put American exporters on a level playing field against competitors from Europe, China and Australia, which also have free trade agreements with Seoul.  Without KORUS, U.S. exports of agricultural and manufactured products, as well as services, would likely have fallen substantially over the past five years,  he said.

Reopening the agreement could lead to its unraveling, which would only benefit our trade competitors,  Brilliant said. Adding economic uncertainty to the relationship would also make security cooperation on the North Korean issue more complicated, he said. KORUS was initially negotiated by the President George W.

The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since KORUS took effect in 2012, from $13.2 billion in 2011 to $27.7 billion in 2016.

Residents in Tajoura district said the bodies had begun washing up at the end of last week. Several had been partially devoured by stray dogs, according to a local coast guard official. The toll was expected to increase as the flimsy boats used to carry migrants as far as international waters normally carry more than 100 people. Three migrants died in the Mediterranean on Monday night, a German aid group said, during Italian-led rescue operations in which thousands more were pulled to safety. About 5,000 migrants were picked up off the Libyan coast by emergency services, Italy's navy, aid groups and private boats on Monday, and rescues were continuing on Tuesday, according to an Italian coastguard spokesman.  Despite all efforts, three people died from a sinking rubber boat  and rescue boats in the area are struggling to cope, German humanitarian group Jugend Rettet said on Facebook. Jugend Rettet (Rescuing Youth) is one of about nine aid groups patrolling seas into which people traffickers have sent more than half a million refugees and migrants on highly dangerous voyages towards Europe over the past four years.  Rescuers carry a bag containing the dead body of a migrant at the coast of Tajoura, east of Tripoli, Libya, June 27, 2017.Ismail Zitouny We reached the capacity limit of our ship, while our crew is seeing more boats on the horizon. Currently, all vessels are overloaded,  Jugend Rettet added.  The total number of migrants reaching Europe by sea so far this year is less than half that counted in the same period of 2016, thanks to a deal between the EU and Turkey which blocked a once-busy route to Greece. But the number coming to Italy has risen.   Rescuers carry a bag containing the dead body of a migrant at the coast of Tajoura, east of Tripoli, Libya, June 27, 2017.Ismail ZitounyAbout 72,000 migrants arrived in Italy on the perilous route from Libya between Jan. 1 and June 21, roughly 20 percent more than in 2016, and more than 2,000 died on the way, according to the International Organization for Migration.  Criminal gangs have taken advantage of widespread lawlessness in Libya to establish profitable businesses, cramming mainly sub-Saharan African and Bangladeshi migrants into flimsy rubber boats. The Spanish naval ship Victoria, deployed in the European Union's Mediterranean mission, went to the aid of six boats and took on migrants from rescue vessels that were already full to capacity, Spain's defense ministry said. The Victoria then headed to the southern Italian island of Lampedusa with 907 migrants on board, one of whom was in critical condition, a ministry statement said.    Italy and the EU are trying to work with Libyan authorities to fight smugglers, but the same chaos which allowed the gangs to flourish is hampering official efforts.

Luis Rangel, Brazil's plant and animal health secretary, told Reuters in an interview that Brazilian beef suppliers were still working to adapt to stricter requirements of the U.S market. He said some problems raised by U.S. food safety authorities  would be tolerated in other markets  and that no system was infallible.  Last week, the U.S. government blocked imports of Brazilian fresh beef, less than a year after opening the market to the product. U.S. officials said inspections of arriving shipments uncovered defects such as abscesses, prohibited tissues and unidentified material in the meat. Last week, Brazilian officials said most problems with the meat stemmed from vaccinations and were being addressed. On Monday, a local union said the industry lacked enough inspectors to insure product safety, and blamed government budget cuts.  Rangel said there is a shortage of inspectors. He said the ministry was seeking funding to hire 1,600 new inspectors, an increase of more than 50 percent from the current number of 2,800.  The American market is the most demanding among the markets we serve, so the Brazilian companies will have to adapt, will have to follow the requirements very closely,  said Rangel.  We are already making some changes after the issues raised by the U.S. authorities. They will solve most problems and will open the way for a solution,  he added. The U.S. move against the world's largest beef exporter surprised Brazilian officials, who said they would work with U.S. authorities on a roadmap to allow for beef shipments to resume. Brazilian officials said abscesses found in the shipments could have been caused by vaccination against foot and mouth disease. Rangel said exporters do not always cut the front part of an animal into small enough pieces, making it harder to identify these problems in some shipments.  We already changed that for the whole chain. Every processor will have from now on to cut that front part in pieces, to better identify those problems,  he said. He maintained that U.S. officials did not give Brazil adequate time to adapt to the country's strict import requirements, saying the swift decision to ban the product was unusual considering international trade negotiations.  There was a mission from the USDA here less than a month ago. We thought the visits, the talks were good. The report from that is not even out yet and they decided to close the market,  said Rangel. The official said Brazil was working out with the United States the next steps to solve the issues, saying regaining access to the U.S. market was a priority.

No threat was found and an investigation is under way to determine who made the calls from within a building where the shooter was reported to have been, Colonel Thomas Holliday, commander of the Redstone Arsenal, said at a press conference.  We have no evidence of shots actually (being) fired,  Holliday said. One of the calls to 911 emergency dispatchers said gun shots had been heard, and another said a gun had been seen. Neither of those were credible, Holliday said. There were no casualties, and no one was arrested, Holliday said. There were no visitors on that part of the base on Tuesday, he added. The base is home to military units including the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command and elements of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Missile Defense Agency. It also hosts the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Marshall Space Flight Center, where rocket research and testing is conducted.  A total of about 43,000 military, NASA and civilian personnel work at Redstone Arsenal. Holliday said the response of base personnel was appropriate, given that every U.S. military base has to be on high alert for potential active shooters and other acts of violence. It took hours to ensure that everyone was safe in the 1.5-million-square-foot (457,200-square-meter) Sparkman Center complex where the shooter was reported. A full base lockdown lasted for about two-and-a-half hours, and some buildings were shut for four-and-a-half hours, Holliday said.  A drill to handle a situation similar to the one reported on Tuesday was to occur later this week, but was canceled after this incident, Holliday said.

As part of the Cook County Circuit Court lawsuit, the Illinois Retail Merchants Association is seeking an injunction preventing enforcement of the law and a declaration that it is invalid.   This ordinance is incomplete and it's a perfect example of the disaster that awaits when policies are hurried through without serious thought to how they might impact the businesses that have to try to comply with these policies,  the retailer association's president, Rob Karr, said in a statement.  The Cook County Board of Commissioners passed the tax last November. It applies to all bottled sweetened beverages, including soda, sports drinks and energy drinks. Cook County, which includes Chicago and its surroundings, joined a growing number of localities that have adopted measures to cut consumption of sugary drinks for health reasons, including Seattle, Philadelphia and San Francisco. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle's spokesman, Frank Shuftan, said in an email that county officials are still reviewing the lawsuit and they intend to  aggressively defend  the ordinance in court. Preckwinkle previously lauded the tax as a benefit to public health and a necessary way to increase revenue. Officials with the Cook County Department of Revenue, which the association also named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment.  The state retail organization, which represents more than 20,000 stores, asserted in the lawsuit that the county's penny-per-ounce beverage tax violates the state constitution by imposing different taxes on similar beverage products.  For example, a packaged sweetened ice tea would be subject to the tax, while a similar drink served from behind the counter would not, the complaint said.     The tax also makes retailers vulnerable to becoming ineligible for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, according to the complaint, because the program prohibits purchasing food that has a state or local sales tax. The program provides food benefits for millions of U.S. low-income individuals and families. Other parties suing the county include Berkot Super Foods, Fairplay Foods, Chiquita Food Market, Leamington Foods, Tony's Fresh Market, Valli Produce and Walt's Food Centers.

In a letter to the board, the San Francisco-based hedge fund said Deckers management has long ignored shareholders' suggestions to improve performance and is worried that Deckers' current review to sell itself may not result in the best deal for shareholders. Marcato owns nearly 6 percent of Deckers, the maker of UGG boots and apparel, and is its fifth largest investor.  We will be prepared to seek significant board change at the company’s next annual meeting by nominating a slate of director candidates to replace the entire board,  Marcato's portfolio manager, Mick McGuire, wrote. Deckers said in April that it was exploring a sale as part of a review of strategic options.. On Tuesday, the company said in a statement:  As always, our board of directors will continue to take actions that are in the best interests of the company and all stockholders.  McGuire, fresh from winning board seats and ousting the long-serving chief executive officer at Buffalo Wild Wings Inc (BWLD.O) this month, laid out management's missteps and underscored the unhappiness of other large investors. A least six shareholders have urged the company to sell itself but their suggestions have been  consistently ignored,  McGuire said, adding that there has been a  total collapse in shareholders’ confidence in the company’s board of directors and management team.   Although Deckers has engaged an investment bank to explore a sale, the process has been too secretive for Marcato. The fund manager also criticized the company's board, citing its lack of any big investors, lack of expertise in mergers and acquisitions and lack of  meaningful stockholder representation.  While the company has promised to cut $100 million in costs, McGuire said the savings should be at least twice that and said Marcato lacks confidence that current management and the board can get the job done. Investment management firm Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC in March pushed Deckers for a sale, saying its stock had underperformed due to management's  consistently poor capital allocation decisions.  Deckers' shares, which have climbed 22 percent this year,  closed up 1.17 percent at $67.72 on Tuesday. Marcato's main fund has returned 8 percent through the middle of June while its Encore International fund is up 18.3 percent.

Trump, however, has grown increasingly frustrated over China's inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues and is considering possible trade actions against Beijing, three senior administration officials told Reuters. Myanmar was upgraded to the Tier 2 Watch List of nations that deserve special scrutiny, from Tier 3, which includes those countries not complying with minimum U.S. standards and making no significant effort to do so. Afghanistan, Malaysia and Qatar moved up to Tier 2, a list of nations making significant efforts to comply, from the Tier 2 Watch List. Tier 1 designates nations that meet minimum U.S. standards. The report said China convicted fewer sex and labor traffickers in the 12 months ended on March 31 than in the previous year, forcibly repatriated North Koreans without screening them for indicators of trafficking and handled most forced labor cases as administrative issues rather than criminal prosecutions.  China was downgraded to Tier 3 status in this year's report in part because it has not taken serious steps to end its own complicity in trafficking, including forced laborers from North Korea that are located in China,  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said as he presented the report. For the previous three years, China was on the Tier 2 Watch List. It was last in Tier 3, the lowest ranking, in 2013. A Tier 3 rating can trigger sanctions limiting access to U.S. and international aid, but U.S. presidents frequently waive such action. Twenty-one countries were downgraded from their status on last year's report, and 27 countries were upgraded, said Susan Coppedge, the senior State Department official working on human trafficking issues, at a briefing with reporters on Tuesday. Tillerson presented the report in the State Department's Benjamin Franklin room alongside Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and adviser. A crowd of about 300 people, including Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Republican Representative Chris Smith, who authored the anti-trafficking law that mandated the State Department report, attended the ceremony. In a statement, Smith called for sanctions against China as punishment for its record on human trafficking. Ivanka Trump speaks at the 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP) Ceremony at the State Department in Washington, U.S., June 27, 2017.Yuri GripasIvanka Trump has tried to make the fight against human trafficking one of her signature issues. She was instrumental in arranging a White House meeting with anti-trafficking activists that Trump attended in the first few weeks of the administration.  During a visit to Rome last month, she met privately with a group of African women who had been trafficked into prostitution. Beijing confirmed this month that it had detained labor rights activists who scrutinized conditions at a Chinese company making shoes for Ivanka Trump's namesake apparel line. The State Department has urged China to release the activists immediately. Slideshow (5 Images)The State Department on Tuesday also removed Iraq and Myanmar from a list of countries that recruit and use child soldiers. The announcement confirmed a report by Reuters on Friday. U.S. officials told the news agency that Tillerson had disregarded recommendations of State Department experts, senior U.S. diplomats and the State Department's legal office to keep the countries on the list. The State Department declined to comment on how the decision was made, saying it  does not discuss details of internal deliberations.  Human rights advocates criticized the decision, saying international observers continue to document child recruitment by both countries' militaries. Under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008, the U.S. government must be satisfied that  no children are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers  for a country to be removed from the list and U.S. military assistance to resume.  Taking (Myanmar) and Iraq off the list when they continue to use child soldiers is both contrary to U.S. law and harms children still in the ranks,  Jo Becker, children's rights advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement on Monday.  Coppedge said she had raised U.S. concerns about Myanmar's response to the use of child soldiers directly with the Myanmar government in December, and acknowledged that in Iraq children are  highly vulnerable  to forcible recruitment by Iraqi forces in the fight against Islamic State, as well as by Islamic State. But she did not directly respond when asked why the two countries were removed from the list, except to say that Myanmar  has made significant strides in removing children from military service.

In a letter to the board, the San Francisco-based hedge fund said Deckers management has long ignored shareholders' suggestions to improve performance and is worried that Deckers' current review to sell itself may not result in the best deal for shareholders. Marcato owns nearly 6 percent of Deckers, the maker of UGG boots and apparel, and is its fifth largest investor.  We will be prepared to seek significant board change at the company’s next annual meeting by nominating a slate of director candidates to replace the entire board,  Marcato's portfolio manager, Mick McGuire, wrote. Deckers said in April that it was exploring a sale as part of a review of strategic options.. On Tuesday, the company said in a statement:  As always, our board of directors will continue to take actions that are in the best interests of the company and all stockholders.  McGuire, fresh from winning board seats and ousting the long-serving chief executive officer at Buffalo Wild Wings Inc (BWLD.O) this month, laid out management's missteps and underscored the unhappiness of other large investors. A least six shareholders have urged the company to sell itself but their suggestions have been  consistently ignored,  McGuire said, adding that there has been a  total collapse in shareholders’ confidence in the company’s board of directors and management team.   Although Deckers has engaged an investment bank to explore a sale, the process has been too secretive for Marcato. The fund manager also criticized the company's board, citing its lack of any big investors, lack of expertise in mergers and acquisitions and lack of  meaningful stockholder representation.  While the company has promised to cut $100 million in costs, McGuire said the savings should be at least twice that and said Marcato lacks confidence that current management and the board can get the job done. Investment management firm Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC in March pushed Deckers for a sale, saying its stock had underperformed due to management's  consistently poor capital allocation decisions.  Deckers' shares, which have climbed 22 percent this year,  closed up 1.17 percent at $67.72 on Tuesday. Marcato's main fund has returned 8 percent through the middle of June while its Encore International fund is up 18.3 percent.

The decrease among older people may be due to more of them getting the shingles vaccine, U.S. researchers suggest.  Anyone who has had chicken pox or the chicken pox vaccine can develop shingles, but the risk increases sharply after age 50 and vaccination against the shingles-causing virus is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention starting at age 60. Vaccination can cut shingles risk by more than half, and the severe pain, known as post-herpetic neuralgia, by two-thirds, senior study author Dr. Arash Mostaghimi of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston told Reuters Health. Mostaghimi and his colleagues analyzed trends in emergency room visits among various age groups between 2006, when the shingles vaccine first became available in the U.S., to 2013.    More than 1.3 million ER visits were for the shingles-causing virus, they reported in JAMA Dermatology.  Such visits increased by more than 8 percent among 20 to 59-year-olds, but decreased by close to 40 percent among those 60 and older. They also fell by 11 percent in 18 to 19-year-olds, for whom the vaccine against chickenpox - introduced in the U.S. in 1995 - had been recommended.  While the study doesn’t prove that vaccination cut emergency room visits for shingles, Mostaghimi said in an email, “in combination with several other studies, it suggests that, overall, the vaccine is effective in real-life . . . for reducing the likelihood of getting shingles and the severity of illness if it occurs.” Expect to pay about $250 on average for the vaccine in the U.S., Mostaghimi said. Medicare Part D covers at least part of the cost, but private health insurance often provides better coverage. Therefore, you may want to talk with your doctor about getting the vaccine before you switch to Medicare, he suggests.  Dr. David Barlas of the department of emergency medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York said that while most shingles cases can be treated by a primary care physician, people often come to the emergency room if they feel a “sudden, acute sharp pain in the part of the body where shingles is erupting.”  But that pain may precede the rash by as much as a few days, making a diagnosis “tricky,” he told Reuters Health by email. “You may think you have a severe stomach ache, chest pain or even a stroke. Often, the pain only responds to the strong pain medications available in the emergency room.”  If you’re 60 or older and haven’t gotten the vaccine, consider putting a calendar reminder on your smart phone to discuss it with your doctor, he suggests. The vaccine is only good for about five years, he adds, so it’s not recommended for younger people, because the effect would wear off when the risk is increasing. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers information about shingles and the vaccine on its website (here: bit.ly/2iux4yJ).

The bill has already passed the state Senate. The full Assembly, the legislature's lower chamber, is expected to approve it in a vote toward the end of August, after the summer recess. Under the bill, judges could override contract clauses that require customers to settle disputes through arbitration in cases where a bank commits fraud using customers' personal information. Arbitration clauses, which have become standard practice since a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision, make consumers agree not to sue in the future as a condition of purchasing products or services. Clauses inserted into Wells Fargo account-opening agreements have blocked customers from taking the third-largest U.S. bank to court over last year's revelations that it opened millions of accounts without customer knowledge. Regulators fined the bank $190 million for the alleged deceit, of which $5 million was to be paid to customers. The Consumer Attorneys of California backs the state's legislation, and said customers have been trying to sue over the issue since 2013, three years before regulators acted.  By forcing customers into secretive arbitration, Wells Fargo kept the scandal out of public view, allowing the fraud to mushroom while the bank evaded full accountability,  it said in a statement. Republicans and others say class actions, where people band together to share resources in a single lawsuit, only benefit lawyers who reap high fees and suck up time and money. Consumer-rights advocates portray arbitration as a fixed game where companies hire and pay arbitrators to ensure disputes are settled in their favor. Momentum to do away with the clauses led the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to propose a federal rule last year requiring companies to let customers join class actions. That proposal has stalled in the face of opposition from Republicans, who now control both Congress and the White House.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-california-arbitration-idUSL1N1JO207"},

The study can’t say why the more soldiers smoke, the greater the increase in their risk of “overuse musculoskeletal injuries,” but since smoking is a preventable risk factor, it’s another good reason to quit, they write in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. Smoking rates are higher, at about 35 percent, in the U.S. military than in the general U.S. population, where about 19 percent of civilians smoke, the authors write. Muscle and bone injuries are also very common for military members, said lead author Dr. Sheryl Bedno of the Womack Army Medical Center in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, adding that as many as one third of military men and two thirds of military women seek medical care for these types of injuries. “We suspected that smoking was associated with injury, but the findings from the research were not consistent,” Bedno told Reuters Health by email. She noted that smoking decreases bone density and slows down wound healing. To determine whether smoking is linked to injury among members of the military, the study team reviewed 18 studies on military training injuries, such as stress fractures, hip fractures, knee pain or lower extremity injures and tobacco use. Overall, they found that soldiers who smoked were 31 percent more likely to sustain injuries than non-smokers. For women, the extra injury risk tied to smoking was somewhat lower at 23 percent. The more one smoked, the greater the risk increase. Nine studies had data on the amount soldiers smoked, and they found that men who were light smokers had 26 percent higher injury risk compared to nonsmokers, and the heaviest smokers had an 84 percent risk increase.  Though smoking likely plays a large role in the increase in injury risk, there may be other characteristics of people who smoke that could have an effect on their risk, said Edgar Vieira, an injury researcher who was not involved in the study. “There are many other things that will have a stronger effect on injury prevention than smoking cessation, such as reducing overtraining, providing sufficient recovery time and stretching,” said Vieira, who directs the physical therapy doctorate program at Florida International University in Miami. Even quitting smoking during training times may not be enough to protect military members from injury, said Vieira, noting that the inflammation and decreased blood flow caused by smoking can have long-term effects. “The best protection is not to smoke. In addition to all well know health harms it causes, it may also increase your risk of injury,” Vieira said.  “Smoking increases the chances of getting an exercise-related injury about 30 percent, and the more you smoke, the higher the risk of injury,” Bedno said. “We encourage anyone who smokes to stop at the earliest time possible.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2rA30pC Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, online June 13, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-military-smoking-injuries-idUSKBN19I2WY"},

Trump,Douglas Chin,Elly,Heather Nauert,Leon Rodriguez,Shahrzad Rezvani,USA,COURT/IMMIGRATION,VISAS,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Without close family in the United States, Elly and her husband had few options for getting permission to immigrate to America from Iran. So when they won a U.S. government lottery last September for a so-called  diversity visa  allowing them to resettle in the United States, the couple was thrilled.  Since last year, we made all the important decisions in our lives because we hoped we would get a visa,  Elly said, declining to give her full name because her visa application is still in process. The couple decided to put off having children and purchasing a home until after their move to the United States. But the visa, which they still hope to get, is still being processed. Their attorney provided Reuters email documentation of their application to verify some of their account. Elly and her husband are two of the many people who fall into gray areas created by Monday's U.S. Supreme Court order allowing parts of Donald Trump's travel ban to take effect. While the court said it would exempt travelers from the ban who have  bona fide relationships  with Americans, the ruling did not specify exactly what that means, leaving would-be travelers from the six countries affected by the ban uncertain whether they will be allowed to enter the United States. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said Trump's blanket 90-day ban on travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen could proceed, but only for foreigners with no  bona fide relationship  with an American person or entity. The court gave examples of what might qualify some travelers for exemptions from the ban, including close family ties in the United States, admittance to a U.S. university, or offers of employment from an American company. Many advocates for immigrants say they are hopeful that the vast majority of people from the six targeted countries applying for U.S. visas will qualify for such exemptions. But the ruling leaves some things vague, and has led to confusion and anxiety for those like Elly and her husband, who had hoped to come to the United States but do not fall into one of the clear exemptions laid out in the ruling. Also in the gray area are such things as travel strictly for tourism or to attend conferences. Would-be travelers are also asking how close family members need to be, and whether traveling to see close friends in America might qualify. Diversity Visas at Risk Diversity visa applicants like Elly are among those in limbo. The program grants 50,000 visas per year to citizens of countries that normally do not send many immigrants to the United States. In 2015, 10,487 citizens of the six countries targeted by Trump's travel ban were selected for diversity visas, according to State Department figures. Nearly half that number, 4,992, went to Iranians alone.  Absolutely, diversity visas will be affected,  said Leon Rodriguez, a former director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security.  You generally don't even go into the diversity visa system unless you lack another pathway.  The State Department said on Tuesday that it was trying to develop a definition for what constitutes a bona fide relationship for travelers.  We have a couple days still to work this out and get more information,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Tuesday.  We will be looking to the Department of Justice to get more clarification on what a bona fide relationship would be.  Businesses Could Be Spared Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin, who led the legal fight against Trump's revised order, said the exemptions included in the Supreme Court's order will likely spare businesses the kind of disruption they would have faced without them. Chin said his office has reached out to the federal government to try to agree on an interpretation that could avoid additional litigation.  We are trying to look for ways to come up with a framework that everyone can live with going forward,  Chin said. If the U.S. government bars entry to an individual because they lack a  bona fide relationship  with someone in the country, one way to challenge the decision would be for the person to file a so-called contempt motion before the same federal judges in Hawaii or Maryland who blocked the travel ban in the first place, legal experts said. Instead of filing a brand-new lawsuit, the person could ask U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii to hold the Trump administration in contempt because it interpreted the Supreme Court opinion too broadly. Such a strategy could increase the chances of a favorable ruling for the person seeking to enter the United States, since Watson has already shown a dim view toward Trump's policy. Elly and her husband, who are in their late 20s and early 30s respectively and are both university-educated, remain hopeful they will be allowed to come. In May, they had their interviews with consular officials, usually among the final steps before a visa decision. The diversity visa is a pathway to permanent residence, commonly known as a green card.  One could argue that those winning the green card lottery have a bona fide relationship with the U.S. government that is formal, documented and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading the executive order,  said Shahrzad Rezvani, an immigration attorney based in Maryland.

Scaramucci, a Republican fundraiser, has been working at the Washington-based bank since the middle of June and remains the Trump administration's choice for ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a source familiar with the matter said. Scaramucci will focus on developing strategies to support U.S. jobs by financing exports, said Lawton King, a spokesman for the Export-Import Bank, which provides loans to foreign entities that enable them to purchase U.S.-made goods. The news of Scaramucci's appointment was first reported by Politico. Scaramucci agreed in January to sell his investment firm SkyBridge Capital LLC to HNA Capital (U.S.) Holding, along with RON Transatlantic EG, as he prepared to take a public liaison job with Trump. The deal is expected to close in July. While the initial job offer was rescinded, Scaramucci remains loyal to Trump. He told Reuters last month that he would know within a few weeks whether or not he would be working in the administration. By early June, the Trump administration had picked him to become OECD ambassador. The OECD is headquartered in Paris. Scaramucci, a native New Yorker, has not said publicly if he intends to move to France if confirmed by the Senate. Scaramucci was the subject of a CNN article published on Thursday that incorrectly reported he was being investigated by Congress over alleged ties to a Russian investment fund. CNN has since retracted the story and it said the journalists who worked on it have since resigned.

So when they won a U.S. government lottery last September for a so-called  diversity visa  allowing them to resettle in the United States, the couple was thrilled.  Since last year, we made all the important decisions in our lives because we hoped we would get a visa,  Elly said, declining to give her full name because her visa application is still in process. The couple decided to put off having children and purchasing a home until after their move to the United States. But the visa, which they still hope to get, is still being processed. Their attorney provided Reuters email documentation of their application to verify some of their account. Elly and her husband are two of the many people who fall into gray areas created by Monday's U.S. Supreme Court order allowing parts of Donald Trump's travel ban to take effect. While the court said it would exempt travelers from the ban who have  bona fide relationships  with Americans, the ruling did not specify exactly what that means, leaving would-be travelers from the six countries affected by the ban uncertain whether they will be allowed to enter the United States. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said Trump's blanket 90-day ban on travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen could proceed, but only for foreigners with no  bona fide relationship  with an American person or entity. The court gave examples of what might qualify some travelers for exemptions from the ban, including close family ties in the United States, admittance to a U.S. university, or offers of employment from an American company. Many advocates for immigrants say they are hopeful that the vast majority of people from the six targeted countries applying for U.S. visas will qualify for such exemptions. But the ruling leaves some things vague, and has led to confusion and anxiety for those like Elly and her husband, who had hoped to come to the United States but do not fall into one of the clear exemptions laid out in the ruling. Also in the gray area are such things as travel strictly for tourism or to attend conferences. Would-be travelers are also asking how close family members need to be, and whether traveling to see close friends in America might qualify.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for people injured by exploding Takata Corp air bags told a U.S. bankruptcy court judge on Tuesday that the company's restructuring plan is being skewed to benefit automakers over victims. TK Holdings Inc, the U.S. business of Takata, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday due to tens of billions of dollars of liabilities from recalls and lawsuits over its air bags, along with 11 Mexican and U.S. subsidiaries. Most of Takata's obligations are owed to automakers for recalling and replacing millions of its air bags, and the Japanese supplier's restructuring plan relies heavily on financial support from its customers. Several personal injury lawyers told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon that Takata had made too many concessions to automakers, without investigating the value of their claims. Lawyers for TK Holdings and General Motors Co argued the need for financing outweighed the need to investigate the protections granted to the automakers, which could be investigated later.  I will figure that out in due course, but I’m not doing that today,  Shannon said. Authorities have linked 16 deaths, mostly in the United States, and more than 180 injuries to explosions of Takata air bag inflators made with ammonium nitrate that became volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat. Around 100 personal injury and wrongful death cases have been filed in the United States and the company has set aside $125 million for individual claims related to its air bags. Kevin Dean of the Motley Rice law firm urged Shannon to ensure current and future personal injury plaintiffs get an official committee, which includes a budget for lawyers and advisers.  You’ll see 10 years from now these inflators involved in a volume of injuries over time,  said Dean.  We’re dealing with horribly injured plaintiffs.  Shannon acknowledged the role of the plaintiffs and said a committee could be appointed. The U.S. case, and parallel foreign proceedings, opens the door to the acquisition of Takata's viable operations by Key Safety Systems (KSS), a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp. Ningbo Joyson acquired KSS in 2016 in a $920 million deal. The remaining operations will be reorganized to churn out millions of replacement inflators for cars that are subject to recalls. Takata in February pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to a felony charge as part of a $1 billion settlement that included compensation funds for automakers and victims of its faulty inflators.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/takata-bankruptcy-usa-idUSL1N1JO1YC"},

I'm concerned that Russia may backfill North Korea,  Haley told U.S. lawmakers in Washington.  We don't have proof of that, but we are watching that carefully.  While Washington has urged countries to downgrade ties with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, a cross-border ferry service was launched in May between North Korea and neighboring Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the world should talk to, rather than threaten, North Korea.  We just need to keep the pressure on China, we need to keep our eyes on Russia, and we need to continue to let the North Korea regime know we are not looking for regime change ... we just want them to stop the nuclear activity,  Haley said. The U.N. Security Council first imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear tests and two long-range missile launches. The government in Pyongyang is threatening a sixth nuclear test. The Trump administration has been pressing China aggressively to rein in its reclusive neighbor, warning that all options are on the table if Pyongyang persists with its nuclear and missile development programs.  Beijing has repeatedly said its influence on North Korea is limited and that it is doing all it can, but U.S. President Donald Trump last week said China's efforts had failed. The United States has struggled to slow North Korea's programs, which have become a security priority given Pyongyang's vow to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.  The pressure on China can't stop,  Haley said.  We have to have China doing what they're supposed to. At the same time all other countries need to make sure they're enforcing the sanctions that the Security Council has already put in place.  Trump, increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues, is now considering possible trade actions against Beijing, senior administration officials told Reuters. The United States also plans to place China on its global list of worst offenders in human trafficking and forced labor, sources said, a step that could aggravate tensions with Beijing.

Since successfully landing its first Falcon rocket in December 2015, SpaceX has successfully returned boosters 12 more times on drone barges floating in the ocean or on a landing pad on the ground. Two of those boosters were refurbished and relaunched on second satellite-delivery missions.  SpaceX in March took over a spacecraft processing facility at Port Canaveral that once was used to prepare Spacehab science and equipment modules for flight aboard NASA's now-retired space shuttles. The new lease is for 2.2 acres of vacant land adjacent to the Spacehab building.  The hangar that SpaceX wants to build there will be used for rocket refurbishment and storage, company spokesman John Taylor said. The old Spacehab building will be used for offices, rocket storage and to house equipment currently positioned at the dock where SpaceX’s floating landing pad returns from sea, Taylor said.  Right now, we have that work dispersed at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. This will allow us to consolidate and work more efficiently,  Taylor said. SpaceX operates two launch sites in Florida, though one remains out of service following a September 2016 accident that destroyed a $62 million rocket, a $200 million communications satellite and heavily damaged the launch pad. Repairs are underway and SpaceX expects to resume flights from the pad, located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, later this year.  The California-based firm uses the space shuttle's old launch pads at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, just north of the Air Force base. It also has a launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and is building a launch site near Brownsville, Texas. The company is preparing for its 10th flight of the year, and third launch in nine days, on Sunday. SpaceX has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth more than $10 billion, spokesman Taylor said.

The San Francisco-based company, which offers an app that allows people to book journeys on their smartphones, lost a March court battle against Transport for London (TfL) -- one of a number of setbacks as authorities crack down on the business -- but was granted an appeal on Tuesday Uber has cited TfL data showing that the language criteria, which would involve written tests for many, could mean about 33,000 private-hire drivers out of a total of around 110,000 operating in London would be unable to renew their licences. Drivers applying for a new or renewed licence had until the end of September to prove they meet the more rigorous English language criteria, pushed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan partly in response to pressure from drivers of the city's traditional black cabs, who fear their business model is being undercut. But on Tuesday TfL said the plans would not come into place until April next year, after a Court of Appeal hearing due in February.  We maintain that all licensed drivers must be able to communicate in English at an appropriate level,  a TfL spokesman said.  We will continue to robustly defend this position at the appeal.  Uber welcomed the decision to allow its appeal, which comes after a series of setbacks in Britain and around the world.  We're pleased to have secured this appeal to defend tens of thousands of drivers who risk losing their livelihoods because they can't pass an essay writing test,  Uber's London General Manager Tom Elvidge said on Tuesday.

The rule limiting bonuses to 20 percent of fixed pay was instituted under the previous government in response to bailouts of several Dutch banks and insurers during the 2008 financial crisis. However, it has increasingly been cited as a deterrent for international banks that might consider moving personnel or key operations from London to the Netherlands once Britain leaves the European Union. The parliamentary vote - in which a motion to keep the cap in its current form was rejected by the four parties currently negotiating a new coalition - is not binding. But it suggests that an abolition or loosening of the cap will be on the agenda of the incoming government. The European Union as a whole limits financial industry bonuses to 100 percent of fixed pay. No major financial institution has yet said it will move its European headquarters to Amsterdam, although the city is frequently cited near the top of desirable locations due to tax advantages, its large English-speaking population and good infrastructure and social services. Outgoing prime minister Mark Rutte's conservative VVD party won a parliamentary election in March, but he is still trying to form a majority coalition. The motion to keep the existing bonus cap in place was put forward by Labour, the party of outgoing finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, which is not part of the prospective new coalition.

Following is a list of companies and organizations that have reported being hit by cyber attacks: Rosneft Russia's top oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.MM) said its servers had been hit been a large-scale cyber attack but its oil production was unaffected. A.p. Moller-Maersk Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, which handles one out of seven containers shipped globally, said a cyber attack had caused outages at its computer systems across the world.

Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, hit a one-week high on the back of a weaker greenback, short covering and expectations that crude inventories may decline.                  The U.S. dollar        hit 10-month lows against the euro, which firmed after the European Central Bank opened the door to tweaks that might begin to reduce the central bank's emergency stimulus to the economy shortly.                  The International Monetary Fund also cut its growth forecasts for the U.S. economy citing uncertainty over President Donald Trump's fiscal plan.                   A number of things are coming together here,  said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank, noting that the U.S. economic growth advantage has shrunk considerably in recent months as the global economy performed better.      That's particularly the case with Canada, where the Canadian economy seems to be on a bit of a roll at the moment.      At 4:00 p.m. ET (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3166 to the greenback, or 75.95 U.S. cents, up 0.6 percent.     The currency touched C$1.3148, its strongest level since Feb. 27. Its weakest level of the session was C$1.3260.      The 800lb gorilla in the room is the very large CAD short we still had on Friday,  Osborne added.  You've got to think some of the CAD strength is related to position adjustment as those shorts gets squeezed out.      Speculators cut bearish bets on the loonie for a fourth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday. Canadian dollar net short positions fell to 82,881 contracts as of June 20 from 88,595 a week earlier.     The currency's gains came ahead of remarks on Wednesday by Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, who will be participating in a panel discussion at the European Central Bank's Forum on Central Banking.     Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year            price down 13 Canadian cents to yield 0.975 percent and the 10-year             declining 95 Canadian cents to yield 1.570 percent.     The gap between Canada's two-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 4.3 basis points to a spread of -40.6 basis points as Canadian bonds underperformed.

Prosecutors said Vincent Asaro, 82, who was cleared in November 2015 of involvement in the famed 1978 Lufthansa airport heist that helped inspire the movie  Goodfellas,  became enraged when a motorist moved in front of his car at a traffic light. John J. Gotti, Matthew  Fat Matt  Rullan and Asaro, an alleged member of the Bonanno crime family, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn to charges related to the arson and robbery under an agreement with federal prosecutors, said John Marzulli, a spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Bridget Rohde. They are set to be sentenced on Oct. 24. After chasing the car, Asaro tracked down its owner's address and arranged for a fellow Bonanno crime family associate to set fire to the car, prosecutors had said. Gotti, 23, and Rullan, 26, were recruited and torched the car on April 4, 2012, they added. Asaro pleaded guilty to violating the federal Travel Act, and admitted to his involvement in the vendetta arson, the spokesman said. He faces to up 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine and has agreed to repay the car's owner. Gotti pleaded guilty to arson, prosecutors said. He also admitted to taking part in the robbery of $5,941 from the Maspeth Federal Savings and Loan Association in which prosecutors said he and Rullan manned the getaway care on April 28, 2012. Gotti faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He is already serving an eight-year state prison sentence after pleading guilty on March 2 to selling oxycodone, an opioid prescription pain drug. Gotti's infamous grandfather, dubbed the  Teflon Don  for long escaping conviction, eventually went to prison and died behind bars in 2002.  Rullan, who remains free on $1 million bail, admitted taking part in the arson and pleaded guilty to the bank robbery, for which he faces up to 20 years in prison. Gotti and Rullan also admitted to taking part in a bank heist in New York's Queens borough, they said. Another defendant in the Maspeth savings and loan robbery, Michael Guidici, 22, is scheduled to go to trial this fall. Prosecutors say he handed a teller a note saying  I HAVE A BOMB.

The bill has already passed the state Senate. The full Assembly, the legislature's lower chamber, is expected to approve it in a vote toward the end of August, after the summer recess.   Under the bill, judges could override contract clauses that require customers to settle disputes through arbitration in cases where a bank commits fraud using customers' personal information. Arbitration clauses, which have become standard practice since a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision, make consumers agree not to sue in the future as a condition of purchasing products or services. Clauses inserted into Wells Fargo account-opening agreements have blocked customers from taking the third-largest U.S. bank to court over last year's revelations that it opened millions of accounts without customer knowledge. Regulators fined the bank $190 million for the alleged deceit, of which $5 million was to be paid to customers. The Consumer Attorneys of California backs the state's legislation, and said customers have been trying to sue over the issue since 2013, three years before regulators acted.  By forcing customers into secretive arbitration, Wells Fargo kept the scandal out of public view, allowing the fraud to mushroom while the bank evaded full accountability,  it said in a statement.  Republicans and others say class actions, where people band together to share resources in a single lawsuit, only benefit lawyers who reap high fees and suck up time and money. Consumer-rights advocates portray arbitration as a fixed game where companies hire and pay arbitrators to ensure disputes are settled in their favor. Momentum to do away with the clauses led the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to propose a federal rule last year requiring companies to let customers join class actions. That proposal has stalled in the face of opposition from Republicans, who now control both Congress and the White House.

The recommendation from the National Consultative Committee on Ethics (CCNE) comes two months after President Emmanuel Macron promised to legislate on access to medically assisted procreation for lesbians if elected. The all-clear from CCNE, a panel which deliberates on sweeping societal changes made possible by the progress of science, brings France a step closer to the biggest gay rights reform since same-sex marriage was legalised in 2013. A group that spearheaded months of protests before the legalisation of gay marriage denounced the view of the ethics committee. It urged Macron in a statement not to launch what it said would be a  futile  debate on the issue. It cited a poll by Opinionay survey which found earlier this month that 77 percent of respondents answered  yes  when asked if they felt the state should guarantee the right of children born through medically assisted techniques to a mother and a father. Medically assisted procreation is widely available in places such as Britain, Belgium and Spain but it is reserved in France to heterosexual couples, with most or all of the bill paid for by public healthcare funds. France was the 14th country in the world to legalise gay marriage. The CCNE, which is made up of a rotating membership of 39 people representing the main religions as well as ethics experts and scientific researchers, was created by late President Francois Mitterrand in 1983. Gay rights group SOS Homophibie welcomed its recommendation and called on Macron to legislate rapidly. The CCNE said it opposed recourse to surrogate mothers, one of the only ways gay male couples could aspire to parenting, though they can adopt.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/france-politics-procreation-idUSL1N1JO1WO"},

(Reuters) - Lawyers for people injured by exploding Takata Corp (7312.T) air bags told a U.S. bankruptcy court judge on Tuesday that the company's restructuring plan is being skewed to benefit automakers over victims. TK Holdings Inc, the U.S. business of Takata, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday due to tens of billions of dollars of liabilities from recalls and lawsuits over its air bags, along with 11 Mexican and U.S. subsidiaries. Most of Takata's obligations are owed to automakers for recalling and replacing millions of its air bags, and the Japanese supplier's restructuring plan relies heavily on financial support from its customers. Several personal injury lawyers told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon that Takata had made too many concessions to automakers, without investigating the value of their claims. Lawyers for TK Holdings and General Motors Co (GM.N) argued the need for financing outweighed the need to investigate the protections granted to the automakers, which could be investigated later.  I will figure that out in due course, but I’m not doing that today,  Shannon said. Authorities have linked 16 deaths, mostly in the United States, and more than 180 injuries to explosions of Takata air bag inflators made with ammonium nitrate that became volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat. Around 100 personal injury and wrongful death cases have been filed in the United States and the company has set aside $125 million for individual claims related to its air bags. Kevin Dean of the Motley Rice law firm urged Shannon to ensure current and future personal injury plaintiffs get an official committee, which includes a budget for lawyers and advisers.  You’ll see 10 years from now these inflators involved in a volume of injuries over time,  said Dean.  We’re dealing with horribly injured plaintiffs.   Shannon acknowledged the role of the plaintiffs and said a committee could be appointed.   The U.S. case, and parallel foreign proceedings, opens the door to the acquisition of Takata's viable operations by Key Safety Systems (KSS), a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS). Ningbo Joyson acquired KSS in 2016 in a $920 million deal. The remaining operations will be reorganized to churn out millions of replacement inflators for cars that are subject to recalls. Takata in February pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to a felony charge as part of a $1 billion settlement that included compensation funds for automakers and victims of its faulty inflators.

The bill has already passed the state Senate. The full Assembly, the legislature's lower chamber, is expected to approve it in a vote toward the end of August, after the summer recess.   Under the bill, judges could override contract clauses that require customers to settle disputes through arbitration in cases where a bank commits fraud using customers' personal information. Arbitration clauses, which have become standard practice since a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision, make consumers agree not to sue in the future as a condition of purchasing products or services. Clauses inserted into Wells Fargo account-opening agreements have blocked customers from taking the third-largest U.S. bank to court over last year's revelations that it opened millions of accounts without customer knowledge. Regulators fined the bank $190 million for the alleged deceit, of which $5 million was to be paid to customers. The Consumer Attorneys of California backs the state's legislation, and said customers have been trying to sue over the issue since 2013, three years before regulators acted.  By forcing customers into secretive arbitration, Wells Fargo kept the scandal out of public view, allowing the fraud to mushroom while the bank evaded full accountability,  it said in a statement.  Republicans and others say class actions, where people band together to share resources in a single lawsuit, only benefit lawyers who reap high fees and suck up time and money. Consumer-rights advocates portray arbitration as a fixed game where companies hire and pay arbitrators to ensure disputes are settled in their favor. Momentum to do away with the clauses led the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to propose a federal rule last year requiring companies to let customers join class actions. That proposal has stalled in the face of opposition from Republicans, who now control both Congress and the White House.

The rule limiting bonuses to 20 percent of fixed pay was instituted under the previous government in response to bailouts of several Dutch banks and insurers during the 2008 financial crisis. However, it has increasingly been cited as a deterrent for international banks that might consider moving personnel or key operations from London to the Netherlands once Britain leaves the European Union. The parliamentary vote - in which a motion to keep the cap in its current form was rejected by the four parties currently negotiating a new coalition - is not binding. But it suggests that an abolition or loosening of the cap will be on the agenda of the incoming government. The European Union as a whole limits financial industry bonuses to 100 percent of fixed pay. No major financial institution has yet said it will move its European headquarters to Amsterdam, although the city is frequently cited near the top of desirable locations due to tax advantages, its large English-speaking population and good infrastructure and social services. Outgoing prime minister Mark Rutte's conservative VVD party won a parliamentary election in March, but he is still trying to form a majority coalition. The motion to keep the existing bonus cap in place was put forward by Labour, the party of outgoing finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, which is not part of the prospective new coalition.

The $175 million 2027 and $125 million 2047 notes were priced at 100.379% and 100.784% of the principal amounts to yields 3.552% and 4.352% or a 135 and 160 basis point spread over the benchmark rate, respectively. Regency Centers, L.P. is the operating partnership of Regency Centers Corp. (collectively, REG or the company). KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch views the recent merger transaction between REG and Equity One, Inc. (EQY) positively given the quality of EQY's portfolio, its geographic overlap with REG in higher barrier to entry markets and the potential for improved access to debt and equity capital as the largest shopping center REIT. These positive elements are unlikely to result in a materially stronger credit at the onset but could over time as leverage is largely consistent with Fitch's projections when it upgraded REG in August 2016. Further positive rating momentum is supported by REG's demonstration of sector-leading access to capital markets across the broader REIT universe. POSITIVE MOVEMENT IN CREDIT METRICS Fitch expects leverage will settle around 5.0x going forward, an improvement over previous periods. This improvement will be offset slightly given the company's anticipated use of bond offering proceeds to redeem its perpetual preferred shares. Fitch projects REG's pro rata fixed charge coverage will sustain in the low 3x range through 2018. STABLE FUNDAMENTALS Operating fundamentals for shopping centers remain favorable, driven in large part by limited new supply. Pro rata same-store property net operating income (NOI) has grown 3.7% during 1Q17, a slight deceleration from the approximately 4% average growth between 2012-2016. Rent growth has been strong for both new leases and renewals in recent years and is the primary factor driving NOI growth given relatively stable occupancies. Fitch expects that same-property NOI will continue to grow in the low single digits through 2018 with the company maintaining its current occupancy rate. STRONG UA / UD REG's unencumbered asset (UA) pool provides ample contingent liquidity to unsecured bondholders. Fitch expects REG's UA coverage of unsecured debt to sustain around 3.0x during the projection period. This ratio is good for the 'BBB+' rating category, and Fitch does not envision it deteriorating materially. MODERATE GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION REG's community and neighborhood shopping center portfolio has moderate geographic and anchor tenant concentrations. About 75% of REG's annualized base rent is derived from its top 25 markets with the highest concentration in California, although many of the assets REG acquired are of solid quality. REG's three largest tenants by annual base rent (ABR) represent 9.2% of 1Q'17 ABR down from 11.2% at 1Q'16. The company's three largest tenants are Publix Super Markets Inc. (3.2%), The Kroger Co. (3.1%, IDR 'BBB'), and Safeway (2.9%). PRO RATA RATIONALE Fitch looks at REG's property portfolio profile, credit statistics, debt maturities, and liquidity position based on combining its wholly-owned properties and its pro rata share of co-investment partnerships, to analyze the company as if each of the co-investment partnerships was dissolved via distribution in kind. Several of REG's co-investment partnerships provide for unilateral dissolution. Most of these co-investment partnerships provide for a distribution in kind in the event of a dissolution, whereby REG and its limited partner unwind the partnership by distributing the underlying properties (and related property-level debt, if any) to each partner based on each partner's respective ownership percentage in the partnership. Further, the company has supported its co-investment partnerships in the past by raising common equity to repay or refinance its share of secured debt, demonstrating its willingness to de-lever these partnerships. Fitch views REG's partnership platform positively as it provides REG with broader market insights and incremental fee and property income. Via follow-on common equity offerings, the company has also reduced leverage in its partnerships to levels consistent with leverage on the wholly-owned consolidated portfolio. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that REG's operating fundamentals will remain favorable over the next 12 to 24 months and that the issuer will maintain credit metrics consistent with the 'BBB+' rating. DERIVATION SUMMARY REG's rating reflects its superior position as the largest shopping center REIT in higher barrier to entry markets relative to peers. Fitch forecasts that leverage will sustain around 5x, which is good for the rating. The company's portfolio is focused on strong markets with good demographics. The company's access to capital is good, albeit not as strong as higher-rated issuers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for REG include: --Same-store revenue growth in the mid 2% range for 2017-2018; --Acquisitions of $100 million in both 2017 and 2018, all at a 4.5% yield; --Dispositions of $100 million in both 2017 and 2018, all at a 6.5% yield; --Additional (re)development spending of $175 in 2017 and $200 million in 2018; --All secured debt is refinanced dollar for dollar at fixed rates starting at 4.75% in 2017 and rising to 5% by 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on REG's ratings: --Demonstrated market-leading capital markets access across the broader REIT universe; --Fitch's expectation of pro rata leverage sustaining below 4.5x for several quarters; --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x for several quarters. The following factors may have a negative impact on REG's ratings and/or Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x for several quarters; --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 2.5x for several quarters. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates the company as follows: Regency Centers Corporation --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+'; --Preferred Stock 'BBB-'. Regency Centers, L.P. --IDR 'BBB+'; --Unsecured Revolving Facility 'BBB+'; --Senior Unsecured Term Loan 'BBB+'; --Senior Unsecured Notes 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The justices narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had completely blocked key parts of a March 6 executive order that Trump had said was needed to prevent terrorism attacks, allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the United States.  We always believed that the Muslim ban that President Trump imposed soon after assuming office had no basis in facts and would not help fight terrorism,  Iran's Mohammad Javad Zarif told a joint news conference in Berlin with his German counterpart. Zarif called the U.S. decision the  greatest gift  for militant groups seeking new recruits. Separately, Zarif tweeted:  A bigoted ban on Muslims will not keep US safer. Instead of policies empowering extremists, US should join the real fight against them.  Zarif said the travel ban punished people who had never been convicted of a terrorist act, while people from other countries involved in past attacks would not be affected.  For some terrorism and support for terrorism is measured by the amount of arms they buy from the U.S, and not by actually being involved in acts of terrorism,  he said, in an apparent reference to recent U.S. approval of $110 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

(Reuters) - The family of a black man killed last year by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city and police on Tuesday, alleging a history of excessive-force incidents and racism toward African-Americans. The death of Alton Sterling, 37, was among a series of racially charged police killings that inflamed a national debate over treatment of minorities by law enforcement. The lawsuit, filed in state court on behalf of Sterling's five children, seeks unspecified damages from the city, Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. and his department, and the two officers involved in the shooting, among others.  This is not about whether the officers should go to jail. It's about resolving this case for the children who no longer have a father because proper procedures weren't followed,  L. Chris Stewart, one of the children's lawyers, said at a news conference. Police spokesman Don Coppola and Janene Tate, a spokeswoman for Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome, declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Sterling was shot outside a convenience store on July 5, 2016, after a resident reported he had been threatened by a black man selling CDs. Police said Sterling was trying to pull a loaded gun out of his pocket when Officer Blane Salamoni opened fire. FILE PHOTO: A boy sits next to a makeshift memorial outside the Triple S Food Mart where Alton Sterling was fatally shot by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, U.S. July 7, 2016.Jonathan Bachman/File PhotoThe shooting prompted nationwide protests, including a demonstration two days later in Dallas at which five law enforcement officers were fatally shot by an African-American ex-serviceman. Federal prosecutors declined to charge Salamoni and his partner, Howie Lake, in May, saying they lacked evidence to accuse them of civil rights violations. A state investigation is ongoing. Slideshow (2 Images)The 26-page lawsuit alleges that Salamoni and Lake breached protocol, used excessive force and violated Sterling's constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures and of due process. At the time of the shooting, Baton Rouge police lacked written policies on the use of deadly force or on how to ease tense confrontations, the lawsuit said. Baton Rouge also has a  longstanding pervasive policy of tolerating racist behavior by some of its officers,  it said. Dabadie was aware of incidents that included racist-group texts in 2014 and 2017, the lawsuit added. The litigation comes a day after the family of Philando Castile, a black motorist shot to death during a traffic stop in Minnesota last year, reached a $3 million settlement with the city of St. Anthony.

Net proceeds from the offering will be used to repay existing debt, including debt under its 2013 and 2014 revolving credit facilities. Proceeds may also be used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2017, pro forma outstanding borrowings on AMT's RCFs totalled approximately $2.9 billion. The pro forma amount reflects the net repayment of approximately $95 million on is 2013 credit facility subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017. AMT currently has a Fitch Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong FCF and Margins: AMT's ratings are supported by the financial flexibility provided by its strong FCF and its high EBITDA margin, which has been consistently around 60% in recent years. The tower business model translates into strong, sustainable operating performance and FCF growth, aided by the company's significant scale and the favorable demand characteristics for wireless services (particularly data). Stable Growth Model: AMT is expected to continue to post strong FCF, generate mid- to high-single-digit organic growth and maintain relatively stable margins. Tower revenues are predictable, and growth is provided by contractual escalators embodied in long-term lease contracts and there are strong prospects for additional business. The tower industry is benefiting from wireless carriers continued investment in their fourth generation (4G) networks to meet rapidly growing demand for mobile broadband services. Stable Outlook: At March 31, 2017, net leverage was 5.0x, and Fitch expects AMT's net leverage to decline slightly to under 5.0x at the end of 2017. Leverage has gradually declined following AMT's acquisitions over the last couple of years, including the acquisition of the rights to towers and outright purchases of towers from Verizon Communications Inc. in 2015. Consolidation Risk Manageable: Fitch believes U.S. wireless consolidation, if it were to occur, would not have a material effect on AMT's operations. Revenue growth from continued lease activity and contractual escalators in the U.S market would more than offset the relatively modest losses occurring over time due to consolidation. International Exposure: Similar wireless service demand trends are occurring internationally, with wireless data services at an earlier stage of development than in the U.S. Excluding pass-through revenues, the company's international operations generated approximately 34% of total property revenues in the first quarter of 2017. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --In 2017, consolidated revenue grows to approximately $6.6 billion, based on expectations for property revenue to be near the mid-point of company guidance of $6.5 billion. In 2018 and thereafter, Fitch assumes revenue grows in the 4%-5% range due to contractual escalators and new-business growth. --EBITDA margins decline slightly in 2017 due to the lower margins associated with acquired properties but increase moderately thereafter as additional tenants are added to towers. --Capital spending of approximately $850 million in 2017. --Moderate stock repurchases as net leverage under 5x is reached, with further deleveraging arising from EBITDA growth (rather than debt repayment). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: At the current 'BBB' level, Fitch does not currently anticipate near-term developments that could lead to an upgrade of the rating. Negative: A negative rating action could occur if operating performance falls short of expectations of at least mid-single-digit organic growth combined with margin pressure, or if a significant transaction, or share repurchases, results in expectations for net leverage sustained above 5x for longer than an 18-24 month period. LIQUIDITY In Fitch's opinion, AMT has a strong liquidity position supported by its FCF, cash on hand and availability on its revolving credit facilities. Operationally, cash flow generation should remain strong. For 2016, FCF (cash provided by operating activities less capital spending and dividends) was approximately $1 billion. As of March 31, 2017, cash approximated $713 million and unused revolver capacity was approximately $1.77 billion. Of the cash balance, approximately $564 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. AMT has two revolving credit facilities: a $2 billion, multi-currency facility due in January 2022 (the 2014 RCF) and a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility due in June 2020 (the 2013 RCF). The principal financial covenants limited total debt/adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) to no more than 6.0x (up to 7.0x for specified time periods following a qualified acquisition). The covenants limit senior secured debt/adjusted EBITDA to 3.0x for the company and its subsidiaries. If debt ratings are below a specified level at the end of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense must be no less than 2.5x for as long as the ratings are below the specified level. There are no material maturities in 2017, and approximately $1.5 billion matures in 2018. Contact: Primary Analyst John C. Culver, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-3216 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for people injured by exploding Takata Corp (7312.T) air bags told a U.S. bankruptcy court judge on Tuesday that the company's restructuring plan is being skewed to benefit automakers over victims. TK Holdings Inc, the U.S. business of Takata, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday due to tens of billions of dollars of liabilities from recalls and lawsuits over its air bags, along with 11 Mexican and U.S. subsidiaries. Most of Takata's obligations are owed to automakers for recalling and replacing millions of its air bags, and the Japanese supplier's restructuring plan relies heavily on financial support from its customers. Several personal injury lawyers told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon that Takata had made too many concessions to automakers, without investigating the value of their claims. Lawyers for TK Holdings and General Motors Co (GM.N) argued the need for financing outweighed the need to investigate the protections granted to the automakers, which could be investigated later.  I will figure that out in due course, but I’m not doing that today,  Shannon said. Authorities have linked 16 deaths, mostly in the United States, and more than 180 injuries to explosions of Takata air bag inflators made with ammonium nitrate that became volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat. Around 100 personal injury and wrongful death cases have been filed in the United States and the company has set aside $125 million for individual claims related to its air bags. Kevin Dean of the Motley Rice law firm urged Shannon to ensure current and future personal injury plaintiffs get an official committee, which includes a budget for lawyers and advisers.  You’ll see 10 years from now these inflators involved in a volume of injuries over time,  said Dean.  We’re dealing with horribly injured plaintiffs.   Shannon acknowledged the role of the plaintiffs and said a committee could be appointed.   The U.S. case, and parallel foreign proceedings, opens the door to the acquisition of Takata's viable operations by Key Safety Systems (KSS), a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS). Ningbo Joyson acquired KSS in 2016 in a $920 million deal. The remaining operations will be reorganized to churn out millions of replacement inflators for cars that are subject to recalls. Takata in February pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to a felony charge as part of a $1 billion settlement that included compensation funds for automakers and victims of its faulty inflators.

May's increase in consumer prices brought 12-month inflation to 24 percent, well above the central bank's 17-percent target ceiling. But with inflation generally declining from the 40 percent seen in 2016, economists say a rate cut is more likely than an increase over the medium term.  Private and state estimates and indicators suggest that June's inflation rate will be similar to May's, although that would be higher than the monetary authority would hope to see for this time of year,  the bank said in the statement. June's rate will be announced early next month.  The central bank continues its clear anti-inflationary bias to ensure the disinflation process continues toward the goal of a 12 percent to 17 percent inflation rate for 2017,  it said. Private economists expect Argentine inflation to end this year at 21.6 percent, according to the median forecast given in the latest central bank poll.

Stocks on Wall Street finished at session lows after a planned U.S. Senate vote on a healthcare revamp bill was postponed. The delay in the healthcare vote brought back worries about the time table of President Donald Trump's business-friendly agenda. More time spent on healthcare pushes back the discussion on a tax reform eagerly eyed by investors and corporations. The euro posted its largest daily advance versus the dollar in over a year after Draghi, speaking to a conference in Portugal, said the ECB could adjust its policy tools as economic prospects improve in Europe. The euro peaked for the day at a 10-month high of $1.1349 after the delay in the U.S. Senate vote.   People are losing confidence in the ability of the (Trump)administration to get anything done,  said Jason Leinwand, founder and chief executive of FirstLine FX in Randolph, New Jersey.

But the Japanese yen weakened 0.44 percent versus the greenback at 112.36 per dollar. Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2819, up 0.78 percent on the day.

What is this (health bill) going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration? That uncertainty I think is just having people pause a little bit.

U.S. Treasury yields rose in sympathy with European government debt weakness after Draghi's comments. “He surprised the market with that upbeat stance,” said Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global in New York. “The European government bond market didn’t take it very well.” Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 20/32 in price to yield 2.2051 percent, from 2.137 percent late on Monday. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, with the spread between five-year notes and 30-year bonds US5US30=TWEB dropping to a low of 92.5 basis points, the flattest level since late 2007. The spread between 2- and 10-year notes US2US10=TWEB widened slightly to 83 basis points, after earlier touching 76.80 basis points, its lowest level since Sept. 2. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said it is appropriate to raise rates gradually and noted that the U.S. central bank is carefully watching inflation expectations.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index closed down 34.8 points, or 0.23 percent, at 15,281.22.  We are down a minor amount,  said Ian Nakamoto, equity specialist at MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier, a division of Raymond James.  Canada has lagged the U.S. by so much. There has to be a point in time ... where it is due for a catch-up.  The TSX is flat since the beginning of the year, while the S&P; 500 has gained more than 8 percent. But stocks on Wall Street fell broadly on Tuesday after a delay in a healthcare bill vote in the U.S. Senate raised fresh questions about the timeline of President Donald Trump's domestic agenda and as technology stocks lost ground under pressure from lofty valuations. The lightly weighted technology group on the TSX retreated 2.4 percent. Constellation Software Inc declined 2.4 percent to C$695.24 and Shopify Inc fell 6.4 percent to C$114.37. The materials group, including miners, lumber and fertilizer companies, lost 1.3 percent, with Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd sliding 3.1 percent to C$60.65 even as gold rose after hitting a six-week low in the previous session. Magna was also influential on the downside, falling 2.8 percent to C$58.87. The overall consumer discretionary group, which includes the auto parts supplier, lost 1.3 percent. Just three of the index's 10 main groups ended higher. Energy stocks led with a 0.7 percent rise as oil prices climbed. U.S. crude oil futures settled 86 cents higher at $44.24 a barrel. Cenovus Energy rose 4.4 percent to C$9.55.  There's got to be a bottom in terms of oil prices and oil equities. They've come down a lot,  Nakamoto said. The group has fallen nearly 22 percent this year. The heavily weighted financials group edged 0.1 percent higher, helped by modest advances for some of Canada's largest banks. Recent flattening in Canadian and U.S. yield curves had left investors worried that banks' net interest margins could be squeezed. But yield curves steepened on Tuesday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi fueled expectations that the ECB was closer to announcing a reduction of stimulus.

Luis Gustavo Moreno Rivera, the national director of anti-corruption in Colombia, and Leonardo Luis Pinilla Gomez, an attorney practicing in the South American country, were charged in a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Miami. Both men were arrested in Colombia, federal prosecutors said. Attorneys for Moreno, 35, and Pinilla, 31, could not be immediately identified. According to a criminal complaint, the case stemmed from a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration probe that involved a former governor for Colombia's Cordoba region who became a government informant. The complaint did not name him but said the Miami Herald on Monday had published an article about him. That matched the description of Alejandro Lyons Muskus, a former Colombian provincial governor, who faces corruption-related charges in Columbia. He could not be reached for comment. The complaint said the ex-governor is in plea talks with Colombia's attorney general in a corruption-related probe. In November, Pinilla approached the ex-governor with a message from Moreno indicating he was willing to try to obstruct the probe against him in exchange for a fee, the complaint said. In early 2017, Moreno in an effort to entice a bribe disclosed that three people were given immunity to testify against the ex-governor, the complaint said. Pinilla later contacted the ex-governor on Moreno's behalf and asked for 100 million Colombian pesos (about $34,500) in exchange for copies of sworn statements taken from cooperators who testified against him, prosecutors said. The ex-governor traveled to Miami in April, where he has remained. He then contacted the Colombian attorney general and the DEA about Moreno and Pinilla, authorities said. In June, the ex-governor met with both men in Miami and recorded conversations with them, during which they discussed how Moreno could inundate his prosecutors with work to impede their focus on the probe, the complaint said. At the DEA's direction, the ex-governor provided Moreno and Pinilla a $10,000 bribe deposit, the complaint said. Prosecutors said they also wanted 400 million in Colombian pesos with an additional $30,000 to be paid before Moreno left the United States. Prosecutors said several $100 bills from the $10,000 were found on Moreno and his family as they boarded a flight to Bogota.

Stocks on Wall Street finished at session lows after a planned U.S. Senate vote on a healthcare revamp bill was postponed. The delay in the healthcare vote brought back worries about the time table of President Donald Trump's business-friendly agenda. More time spent on healthcare pushes back the discussion on a tax reform eagerly eyed by investors and corporations. The euro posted its largest daily advance versus the dollar in over a year after Draghi, speaking to a conference in Portugal, said the ECB could adjust its policy tools as economic prospects improve in Europe. The euro peaked for the day at a 10-month high of $1.1349 after the delay in the U.S. Senate vote.   People are losing confidence in the ability of the (Trump)administration to get anything done,  said Jason Leinwand, founder and chief executive of FirstLine FX in Randolph, New Jersey.  It will slowly grind on the dollar.  The dollar index .DXY fell 0.99 percent, with the euro EUR= up 1.42 percent to $1.1338. But the Japanese yen weakened 0.44 percent versus the greenback at 112.36 per dollar. Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2819, up 0.78 percent on the day. On Wall Street the technology sector led stocks lower, with losses extending after the healthcare vote delay. “The market likes certainty and now there’s uncertainty,  said Peter Costa, president at trading firm Empire Executions Inc.  What is this (health bill) going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration? That uncertainty I think is just having people pause a little bit.  I also think that when the market gets to certain levels, any type of uncertainty, especially in anything that has to do with the (Trump) administration, will have an adverse effect.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 98.89 points, or 0.46 percent, to 21,310.66, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 19.69 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,419.38 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 100.53 points, or 1.61 percent, to 6,146.62.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.18 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.36 percent. U.S. Treasury yields rose in sympathy with European government debt weakness after Draghi's comments. “He surprised the market with that upbeat stance,” said Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global in New York. “The European government bond market didn’t take it very well.” Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 20/32 in price to yield 2.2051 percent, from 2.137 percent late on Monday. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, with the spread between five-year notes and 30-year bonds US5US30=TWEB dropping to a low of 92.5 basis points, the flattest level since late 2007. The spread between 2- and 10-year notes US2US10=TWEB widened slightly to 83 basis points, after earlier touching 76.80 basis points, its lowest level since Sept. 2. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said it is appropriate to raise rates gradually and noted that the U.S. central bank is carefully watching inflation expectations. The dollar weakness helped boost crude oil futures prices, though the backdrop of a long-standing supply glut kept gains in check. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.76 percent to $43.71 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $46.17, up 0.74 percent on the day.

Female participation on high-speed catamarans has been curtailed by their physical demands and weight limits, but a change in the youth event helped Vose win her place on the team.  I feel incredibly proud to have achieved this ... and hopefully will have shown all the teams that it's an advantage to have a girl on board. None of the other teams had girls and we did and we won,  Vose told Reuters after the event.  Vose, who is studying marine engineering at Southampton University, made her way through Land Rover BAR's selection process after winning four World Championships, one European and 10 national sailing titles. Although there are women in the support crews and shore teams in the main America's Cup which has just finished in Bermuda's Great Sound, sailing remains largely a male preserve.  This lack of women in the hunt for sailing's most prized trophy emphasizes the difficulty they face participating on the foiling catamarans, which are sailed with crews of six, and offer relatively few opportunities for sailors of either gender.    All credit to Annabel for getting on a boat and Land Rover BAR for supporting her through the process,  Saskia Clark, an Olympic gold and silver medalist in the 470 class and winner of the female World Sailor of the Year Award in 2016, said.

There are two spots open to women, helming and wing (sail) trimming,  Clark said. After Emirates Team New Zealand's triumph in the America's Cup on Monday, the format is set change again as the competition heads to Auckland, with an increased emphasis on more physically demanding sailing that could make it even harder for women to get on board.

Fonarow from David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles told Reuters Health. “However, the improvements were not equally distributed across race/ethnicities and genders, and additional efforts are needed.”  Fonarow’s team used information from a national registry of U.S. hospitalizations to investigate trends in heart failure hospital admissions in the decade between 2002 and 2013, when there were a total of more than 12 million hospitalizations for heart failure. When adjusted for age, heart failure hospitalization rates fell by 30.8 percent, an average of 3.3 percent per year, during this period. Overall, rates dropped faster for women, falling 36.0 percent, than for men, for whom they fell 25.8 percent.  Hospitalization rates decreased at about the same rate for whites (29.6 percent) and for blacks (29.4 percent), but throughout this time, rates were more than twice as high among black men and women, according to the report in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. Hispanics experienced a greater decrease in heart failure hospitalization rates, which dropped by 48.4 percent, narrowing their rates relative to whites to within a few percentage points.  Similarly, heart failure hospitalization rates dropped dramatically, by 47.5 percent, among Asians and Pacific Islanders. By 2013, they were 43 percent lower than those for whites.  “Heart failure is largely preventable, and the disparities identified can be reduced or eliminated,” Fonarow said. “The findings highlight the urgent need to address population-based health and prevention, with specific targeting of those most at risk. Equitable health is achievable but will take multidimensional national, community, and local efforts,” he told Reuters Health by email.  “In particular, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for developing heart failure, and achieving optimal blood pressure levels can reduce the risk by more than half. Better awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure, particularly for black men and women is critical,” Fonarow said.  “The time to intensify equitable efforts to prevent and optimize the treatment of heart failure is now,” he said.   That blacks have a 2.5x higher hospitalization rate for heart failure compared to whites is an important finding,” Dr. Parag Goyal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “As the authors point out, the degree of this disparity (specifically in heart failure) has largely been under-appreciated to date, as prior studies have failed to adjust for the younger age distribution of blacks compared to whites.”  Goyal said he hopes the study will stimulate further exploration of the reasons underlying these differences. “These race-related disparities likely go beyond a genetic or physiologic basis; consequently, there is a need to develop population-based interventions to reduce the significant burden of hospitalizations faced by blacks with heart failure,” Goyal said. “Future research should focus on examining the unique vulnerabilities of blacks with heart failure that may underlie this finding.”  Dr. Jia-Rong Wu from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Nursing has explored health disparities in patients with heart failure based on ethnicity and financial status and agrees that money and higher rates of other health conditions are important factors. “However,” she said by email, “in addition to socioeconomic and clinical factors, we found some behavioral factors were associated with cardiac/heart failure hospitalizations. Therefore, it is important to optimize heart failure management and control/manage risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia),” Wu said.  “It is equally important to develop interventions/strategies to help black patients with heart failure to improve self-care behaviors to eliminate the disparities.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/2tlAAUu Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, online June 27, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heartfailure-race-disparities-idUSKBN19I2TS"},

The rule updated the federal Clean Water Act to define what waterways - including streams, rivers and other bodies - can be regulated by the federal government, stirring anger by the agriculture and energy industries, which said it gave regulators too much authority.  We are taking significant action to return power to the states and provide regulatory certainty to our nation's farmers and businesses,  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said. The Clean Water Act, passed in 1972 and last amended in 1987, is intended to protect the nation's waters from pollution. In February, President Donald Trump said during the signing of an executive order calling for a review of the rule that the act should apply only to navigable waters that affect interstate commerce. Some lawmakers and officials from states with large rural areas praised the move. “Out-of-state D.C. bureaucrats shouldn’t impose regulations that hurt Montana farmers, ranchers and landowners,” said the state's Republican senator, Steve Daines. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture welcomed the change, saying the 2015 rule was flawed and  fraught  with procedural issues,  making it necessary to start over with a new rule that protects clean water and respects state regulatory authority.  Environmental groups criticized the move, saying it ignores public input and would put parts of the country like the Midwestern Great Lakes at risk.  This foolish rollback of clean water standards rejects years of work building stakeholder input and scientific data support, and it imperils the progress for safe clean drinking water in the Midwest,” said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center. Others said the rollback will lead to pollution in some of the country's most sensitive wetland areas.  Revoking the clean water rule will open the door to the pollution and bulldozing of some of America's most important wetlands,  said Kierán Suckling, executive director at the Center for Biological Diversity The rule had been placed on hold in 2015 by a federal court appeals court.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-regulation-idUSL1N1JO1IY"},

Ross, speaking via live stream to an economic event in Berlin attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel, said that even  countries that were not direct sources of dumping could face difficulties under these circumstances. He did not specify what kind of measures President Donald Trump would take to tackle overcapacity in the steel sector, a major issue for an administration that says it wants to make U.S. trade ties fairer.  If President Trump takes action on dumping it will be in the hope of provoking a collective solution by importing nations,  Ross told members of Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union.  Lacking strong action in conjunction with our partners we may have no alternative but to engage in self help,  he said.  If we do so it might have to be on a broad scale.  Ross has previously said he hoped to complete by the end of June a national security study of the U.S. steel industry that could result in broad new steel import restrictions. The commerce department is invoking a Cold War-era trade law that allows the president to limit imports of certain products and materials deemed critical for national defense. Timing of the review's results and any subsequent actions are uncertain. Trump administration officials told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that new steel tariffs were among trade options under consideration against China for Beijing's inaction on reining in North Korea and on international trade issues.      Chinese steel already is subject to dozens of U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties, sharply limiting China's direct share of the U.S. steel market. New restrictions under the defense review could have a larger impact on steel imported from U.S. allies such as Germany, Japan and South Korea.  In his remarks to the conference, Ross also mentioned  pharmaceuticals, chemicals and transportation as other sectors in which the United States ran a particularly large deficit with the European Union, but said the two blocs should work together to tackle dumping by third countries. Taking the floor after Ross had spoken, Merkel welcomed Ross's calls for resumed work on a U.S.-EU trade agreement but stressed that Germany's investments in the United States were major job creators for the country.

The benchmark S&P; 500 posted its biggest one-day drop in about six weeks and closed at its lowest point since May 31. Major indexes extended losses after U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell decided to put off a planned vote on a bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act until after the Senate's July 4 recess. The healthcare legislation, which has encountered resistance from several Republicans, is the first plank of Trump's domestic policy agenda, with investors eager for him to move onto his other plans including tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation.  Promises for such domestic polices helped fuel a 13.1-percent rise for the benchmark S&P; 500 since Trump's Nov. 8 election. “The market likes certainty, and now there’s uncertainty,  said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions in New York.  What is this going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration? That uncertainty I think is just having people pause a little bit.   Related CoverageLow volatility belies fragile U.S. stocks: reports I also think that when the market gets to certain levels, any type of uncertainty, especially in anything that has to do with the administration, will have an adverse effect,  Costa said.

Big tech names weighed most heavily on the S&P; 500. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) fell 2.5 percent after EU antitrust regulators hit the tech giant with a record $2.7-billion fine.

Data showed consumer confidence for June rose more than expected, which could bolster the Fed's case for another rate hike this year. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said the Fed rightly plans to raise rates once more this year, given recent inflation weakness is likely temporary. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she does not believe there will be another financial crisis for at least as long as she lives, thanks largely to reforms of the banking system since the 2007-09 crash.

Stocks remain near record highs and daily price fluctuations, by one measure, are close to being the most minimal in nearly half a century. However, calm markets and buoyant stocks may be hiding the fact that the next volatility shock could be just around the corner, according to some analysts.  Markets remain fragile,  BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research analysts led by Benjamin Bowler said in a note on Tuesday. The bank pins this on poor liquidity, low investor conviction and highly crowded positioning. The sudden and sharp stocks slump in mid May, amid increased concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to deliver on tax cuts and other pro-business policies, while fleeting, shows the extent to which markets are prone to  flash crashes,  the analysts said. A rise in BofA Merrill Lynch's  fragility indicator,  which measures the frequency and magnitude of abnormally large shocks for certain cross-asset volatilities and credit spreads, is also ringing alarm bells.  This indicator has been rising over the past six months even as cross-asset risk has fallen.  While our base case remains a summer range-trade for the S&P; 500 as policy and positioning 'collar' U.S. equities, identifying low-cost hedges for a 'fragility event' in U.S. equity volatility may be prudent,  the BofA said. JP Morgan analysts last week raised the possibility that stock trading could turn volatile, and fast. The bank's analysts reiterated a call for market volatility to lift from record lows in the  near future.  With U.S. rates rising and monetary accommodation from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan expected to recede, there is likelihood of market turmoil in the medium term, JP Morgan said. But just as these two banks are warning on volatility risks, investors have been pouring into exchange traded products (ETPs) linked to the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, particularly the inverse VIX ETPs which are used to bet on prolonged calm. Current positioning in these ETPs is near all-time extremes, according to BofA.  A sudden shock to U.S. equities could pressure those invested in such strategies to short cover, thus exacerbating the rise in volatility,  the bank says.

The procurement of the drones, favoured by the military because they are compatible with models they already own, has been a matter of contention between the parties in the ruling coalition government. Social Democrat parliamentary head Thomas Oppermann said his party supported the procurement of reconnaissance drones but had reservations about leasing the Heron TP drones from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) that can be armed and used to protect soldiers serving in Afghanistan and Mali. The SPD are the junior partner in conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's right-left coalition. General Karl Muellner, the top officer in Germany's air force, said the move was wrong-headed and would leave soldiers without the additional protection of quick and precise drones.  I respect political decisions, but I consider this wrong from an expert viewpoint,  Muellner said in a statement late on Tuesday. German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, a member of Merkel's conservatives, accused Oppermann of leaving German soldiers  in the lurch , and said the move was also hypocritical since the SPD had voted last year to back development of an armed European drone. The dispute comes three months before a national election, and reflects lingering scepticism in Germany about offensive military actions given Germany's militaristic past. The German military did participate in allied air strikes in the Kosovo war in 1999 and German troops have served in Afghanistan for well over a decade, but the issue remains divisive in the general population. Defence Ministry sources said the SPD had been closely involved in the preparation of the budget plans that map out what the government would be funding with the procurement of the drones. Security sources said the document in question called for moves to prepare the arming of the drones, and training for German soldiers that would have speeded up their operational use. Without those steps it would take one to two years to arm the drones, the sources said. SPD lawmakers said they had not expected accelerated moves to arm them.

The agencies are working to rescind the rule, known as the Waters of the United States rule, and reinstate the language of the rule before it was changed in 2015. The rule updated the federal Clean Water Act to define what waterways - including streams, rivers and other bodies - can be regulated by the federal government, stirring anger by the agriculture and energy industries, which said it gave regulators too much authority.  We are taking significant action to return power to the states and provide regulatory certainty to our nation's farmers and businesses,  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said. The Clean Water Act, passed in 1972 and last amended in 1987, is intended to protect the nation's waters from pollution. In February, President Donald Trump said during the signing of an executive order calling for a review of the rule that the act should apply only to navigable waters that affect interstate commerce. Some lawmakers and officials from states with large rural areas praised the move. “Out-of-state D.C. bureaucrats shouldn’t impose regulations that hurt Montana farmers, ranchers and landowners,” said the state's Republican senator, Steve Daines.

The Ivy League school said in the lawsuit it wants to designate all single-occupant restrooms at its law school as gender neutral, but the plan runs afoul of the state building code, which does not count gender-neutral bathrooms when it assesses whether a public building has enough toilets. A spokeswoman for Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, said on Tuesday his administration would seek to grant Yale's request, which was made in a lawsuit filed on Friday in Connecticut Superior Court in New Haven. Yale sued after receiving complaints from law school students, seeking a waiver from requirements that single-user restrooms have an assigned gender label to count toward state requirements. FILE PHOTO --  Students walk on the campus of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut November 12, 2015.Shannon /File Photo We stand firmly with Yale in their effort to create a more welcoming campus,  Malloy spokeswoman Meg Green said in an email.  This has been a priority for Governor Malloy's administration and, now that this issue has been brought to our attention, we are prepared to work with Yale toward a solution.   Restrooms have become a flashpoint in the fight over  transgender rights, after North Carolina passed a law last year requiring people to use public restrooms that corresponded with their birth gender. The measure was partially repealed in March after the state lost hundreds of millions of dollars from economic boycotts. FILE PHOTO --  Old Campus at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, November 28, 2012.Michelle McLoughlin/File PhotoTexas lawmakers are expected to consider a similar measure next month. Proponents of the bathroom bills say they aim to protect individual privacy. That is not a factor in the Yale case, which focuses on single-occupant restrooms.  The proposed shift in designation to gender neutral ... would facilitate quick access to a bathroom within the building for persons of all gender identities,  the 315-year-old university wrote in the lawsuit. The state code would require Yale to build more bathrooms to be in compliance with rules about the number of restrooms for men and women. The school said it would be impractical and unnecessary in its century-old law school building.

Anthony Murgio, 33, of Tampa, pleaded guilty on Jan. 9 to three conspiracy counts, including bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The sentence was roughly half as long as prosecutors had sought. Murgio and co-conspirators were accused of processing millions of dollars from 2013 to 2015 into the virtual currency bitcoin through the unlicensed exchange Coin.mx. Prosecutors said many transactions were conducted by victims of ransomware, a malicious software that locks up data unless people pay  ransom  to unlock it. Cyber criminals often demand ransom paid in bitcoin. The alleged schemes also involved the takeover of a since-liquidated New Jersey credit union to shield their activity.  Mr. Murgio led an effort based on ambition and greed,  and constructed on a  pyramid of lies,  U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said during the sentencing hearing. Murgio unsuccessfully fought back tears and lost his composure several times in expressing  enormous regret  for his crimes, which the judge credited as genuine.  I am wiser today than when the case began, and I am sorry for all the damage I caused to so many people,  Murgio said.  Believing what I was doing was OK did not make it OK.  Nathan cited Murgio's generosity to friends and support to his family in imposing a term below the 10 to 12-1/2 years recommended by prosecutors and federal guidelines. Murgio's lawyer Brian Klein said he was pleased with the reduction, after telling the judge that Murgio had taken responsibility for his  grievous decisionmaking.  In contrast, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eun Choi faulted Murgio's dealings with ransomware victims, saying:  He exploited their desperation to personally profit from them.  A hearing on restitution and forfeiture was set for Sept. 1. Murgio's father, Michael, pleaded guilty last October to an obstruction charge tied to the credit union. Nine people have been criminally charged following an investigation into the JPMorgan breach, which exposed more than 83 million accounts. Prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, who pleaded not guilty to U.S. charges after being extradited last June from Israel. In March, a jury in Manhattan convicted Florida software engineer Yuri Lebedev and New Jersey pastor Trevon Gross of scheming to conceal Coin.mx's activities from banks and regulators. They have yet to be sentenced. The case is U.S. v.

Bumble is all about making connection with people,  said Shaden Abboushi, director of marketing at Bumble. Abboushi said New York City was an obvious choice for the app's first physical location as many of its 14 million users live in one of the city's five boroughs but she added that the company plans to open other pop-up locations around the country.  While it's great to be on your phone, and make connections via the app, we want to create a space and an extension of that where people could come and meet in real life, in person.  For the month of June, those eager to experience the pop-up lounge dubbed  BumbleHiveNYC  were asked to show to the bouncer at the door proof of having installed the dating app on their phones. If they successfully identified themselves as users, they were invited into the modernly decorated, yellow and white space for free to mingle over complimentary drinks and snacks and dance to music provided by live DJs. Most visitors were in their 20s.  I think it's a great way for people to connect in New York City,  said Liz Marschall, a New York City resident who came to the Hive on a recent Sunday wearing a white tank-top, jean shorts and heels.   It can be really difficult, living here and meeting people, even at bars, because there are so many people... When you come here, everyone has a really similar interest in mind,  she added.

Temer, who was charged Monday night with arranging to receive millions of dollars in bribes, said the move would have a negative impact on Brazil's economic recovery, possibly paralyzing efforts at reform. The conservative leader said executives of the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS SA, who accused him in plea-bargain testimony of arranging to take 38 million reais ($11.4 million) in bribes in the coming months, did so only to escape jail for their own crimes.  I have been charged with taking bribes without ever having received a cent,  Temer said in a nationally televised speech.  I've never seen any of that money and I have never taken part in planning to commit any crimes.  Under Brazilian law, now that top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot has charged Temer, it is up to the House of Deputies to vote on whether or not to allow the Supreme Court to try the leader, who replaced impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff just over a year ago. Two-thirds of the lower house must vote against Temer for his trial to occur. Temer's allies in the lower house say they have the votes needed to block the charge. But Janot is widely expected to level fresh charges of racketeering and obstruction of justice against Temer in the coming weeks, forcing lawmakers into multiple votes on a possible presidential trial. Several top lawmakers allied with the ruling coalition have told Reuters they are concerned that multiple votes to protect a deeply unpopular leader could erode his support, eventually prying open the door to a trial. If a case against Temer were taken up by the Supreme Court, the president would be removed from office for at least 180 days, leaving House speaker Rodrigo Maia to serve as the country's interim leader. Temer, whose government has an approval rating in the single digits, has already resisted repeated opposition calls to resign. But if he were found guilty, Congress would then choose someone to lead the nation through the remainder of his term, which ends on Jan. 1, 2019. The charge against Temer was widely expected and investors were calm on Tuesday. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index was down 0.8 percent and the local currency slipped 0.6 percent in late afternoon trading. Investigators have uncovered corruption at all levels of Brazil's political class and business elites in recent years. Much of it centers on companies paying billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives at state-run enterprises in return for lucrative contracts. Temer and one-third of his cabinet, as well as four former presidents and dozens of lawmakers are under investigation or already charged in the schemes. Over 90 people have been convicted.

While BlackBerry's traditional customers were security executives in top global companies, its reboot from smartphone maker to seller of everything from automotive software to cyber security consulting and asset tracking for the trucking industry has seemingly moved faster than its sales force can keep up. BlackBerry's revenue started declining in 2013 after Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) wrested control of the smartphone market from the Canadian company. Chen took over as chief executive to fashion a turnaround and has been adding new software businesses to boost revenue, which remains a fraction of what it was in its heyday. Chen told analysts on Friday he planned to hire more salespeople for industrial software maker QNX, acquired in 2010, as well as for its Internet of Things business, which connects computing devices in everyday objects and includes the Radar asset tracking service for trucking. Our issue is get it out there and get the deal done,  he said.  And so we really need to ramp up our distribution channels.  A sales force boost will likely eat into profit, at least in the short-term, as the metrics of success BlackBerry wants to achieve typically depend on higher commissions to motivate sales staff.  Salespeople are coin-operated,  said Berkeley Warburton, managing director of advanced customer strategy at Accenture.  If you want the right behaviours out of them you have to incentivise them in the right way.  BlackBerry, which ended February with just over 4,000 employees compared with more than 4,500 a year earlier, declined to say how many of them were involved in sales. Five years ago the company had 16,500 employees, with 1,500 working in sales and marketing. BlackBerry on Friday disappointed investors with an unexpected software sales decline, pushing its shares down as much as 13 percent after a sharp rally in recent months. BlackBerry's quarterly revenue miss prompted caution about Chen's efforts to revive growth.  It's really different, in terms of who makes decisions about those things, it's no longer the IT (information technology) team. It's now the product design team,  said Eric Johnson, the dean of Vanderbilt University's Owen School of Management. Coupled with that, many of the products and services it is now pitching are much more complicated than selling smartphones.  The product doesn't sell itself in the way that they used to. They have more complex products,  so BlackBerry's salespeople need to shift focus and sell solutions instead, Accenture's Warburton said. For example, BlackBerry's QNX unit must integrate its automotive software with that of many other vendors as well as the carmaker on a production timeline of years rather than months.   It's a highly consultative sales process,  Vanderbilt's Johnson said.  They're going to have to make significant investments in their sales force to make it work.   BlackBerry reached a deal to work directly with Ford Motor Co (F.N) last year, but Chen told reporters in a briefing on Friday that talks with other automakers were taking a long time to bear fruit.   The reason is they are going to have to adopt most of our technology for it to make sense,  Chen said.  This is not a technology issue. ... The contractual terms and requirements are the long goal.

Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's main international backer, denounced the warning and dismissed White House assertions that a strike was being prepared as  unacceptable,  raising the tension between Washington and Moscow over the Syrian civil war. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the United States had recently seen activity at Shayrat airfield, the same base targeted by a U.S. cruise missile strike on April 6.  This involved specific aircraft in a specific hangar, both of which we know to be associated with chemical weapons use,  Davis said. Davis said the activity occurred during  the past day or two.  He did not say how the United States collected its intelligence. The White House said on Monday it appeared the Syrian government was preparing for another chemical weapons attack and warned Assad that he and his military would  pay a heavy price  if it went ahead. The U.S. strike on Shayrat followed the deaths of 87 people in what Washington said was a poison gas attack in rebel-held territory two days earlier. Syria denied it carried out the attack.         Russia challenged the U.S. intelligence about a possible attack.  I am not aware of any information about a threat that  chemical weapons can be used,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.  Related CoverageSyria's Assad visits Russian air baseHaley: U.S. saw preparations in Syria similar to April chemical attackMacron, Trump agree to work together if new Syria chemical attack: Elysee Certainly, we consider such threats to the legitimate leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic unacceptable.  Russian officials have privately described the war in Syria as the biggest source of tension between Moscow and Washington, and the April cruise missile strike ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump raised the risk of confrontation between them.     Assad visited a Russian air base at Hmeymim in western Syria on Tuesday, his first visit to the base from which Russian jets have supported his war effort. Photos circulated showed the Syrian leader in the cockpit of a Russian Sukhoi SU-35 warplane, and inspecting weapons, personnel and armored vehicles at the base near Latakia. u.s.

SANA/Handout via REUTERSThe Syrian military and Foreign Ministry did not comment on the White House warning, although a Syrian state-run television station, al-Ikhbariya, said the allegations were fabricated.     U.S. Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the concerns about preparations for a chemical weapons attack were authentic.  The claims that they made, from my perspective, are valid claims,  he said.  The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said the Trump administration intended its warning to be aimed not just at Syria's government but also at Russia and Iran, another supporter of Assad.  Slideshow (3 Images) I believe that the goal is, at this point, not just to send Assad a message but to send Russia and Iran a message that if this happens again we are putting you on notice,  Haley said in a hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives. She stressed the primary U.S. goal in Syria is to fight Islamic State, not to remove Assad.   I don't see a healthy Syria with Assad in place, but the U.S. priority has and continues to be to fight ISIS,  she said. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democratic member of the foreign affairs and armed services committees, who has been leading a bipartisan push for Congress to debate and vote on the use of military force in Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere, said there was no legal justification for extracting a “heavy price” from Syria. U.S. and allied intelligence officers had for some time identified several sites where they suspected Assad's government  may have been hiding newly made chemical weapons from inspectors, said a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. That assessment was based in part on the locations, security surrounding the suspect sites and other information that the official declined to describe. Although the intelligence was not considered conclusive, Washington decided to issue the public warning to the Syrian leadership to try to deter such a strike, said the official, who declined to discuss the issue further. The number of people killed in suspected chemical attacks is a small portion of the total dead in Syria's civil war - a figure the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, estimates is close to half a million. But television footage of victims of April's attack, including children, writhing in agony, caused revulsion across the world.  After the April attack, Trump accused Assad's government of going  beyond a red line  and approved what U.S. officials called a  one-off  strike to deter future chemical attacks.

While BlackBerry's traditional customers were security executives in top global companies, its reboot from smartphone maker to seller of everything from automotive software to cyber security consulting and asset tracking for the trucking industry has seemingly moved faster than its sales force can keep up. BlackBerry's revenue started declining in 2013 after Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) wrested control of the smartphone market from the Canadian company. Chen took over as chief executive to fashion a turnaround and has been adding new software businesses to boost revenue, which remains a fraction of what it was in its heyday. Chen told analysts on Friday he planned to hire more salespeople for industrial software maker QNX, acquired in 2010, as well as for its Internet of Things business, which connects computing devices in everyday objects and includes the Radar asset tracking service for trucking. Our issue is get it out there and get the deal done,  he said.  And so we really need to ramp up our distribution channels.  A sales force boost will likely eat into profit, at least in the short-term, as the metrics of success BlackBerry wants to achieve typically depend on higher commissions to motivate sales staff.  Salespeople are coin-operated,  said Berkeley Warburton, managing director of advanced customer strategy at Accenture.  If you want the right behaviours out of them you have to incentivise them in the right way.  BlackBerry, which ended February with just over 4,000 employees compared with more than 4,500 a year earlier, declined to say how many of them were involved in sales. Five years ago the company had 16,500 employees, with 1,500 working in sales and marketing. BlackBerry on Friday disappointed investors with an unexpected software sales decline, pushing its shares down as much as 13 percent after a sharp rally in recent months. BlackBerry's quarterly revenue miss prompted caution about Chen's efforts to revive growth.  It's really different, in terms of who makes decisions about those things, it's no longer the IT (information technology) team. It's now the product design team,  said Eric Johnson, the dean of Vanderbilt University's Owen School of Management. Coupled with that, many of the products and services it is now pitching are much more complicated than selling smartphones.  The product doesn't sell itself in the way that they used to. They have more complex products,  so BlackBerry's salespeople need to shift focus and sell solutions instead, Accenture's Warburton said. For example, BlackBerry's QNX unit must integrate its automotive software with that of many other vendors as well as the carmaker on a production timeline of years rather than months.   It's a highly consultative sales process,  Vanderbilt's Johnson said.  They're going to have to make significant investments in their sales force to make it work.   BlackBerry reached a deal to work directly with Ford Motor Co (F.N) last year, but Chen told reporters in a briefing on Friday that talks with other automakers were taking a long time to bear fruit.   The reason is they are going to have to adopt most of our technology for it to make sense,  Chen said.  This is not a technology issue. ... The contractual terms and requirements are the long goal.  Chen also said he might buy companies to boost sales, with a focus on growth areas including cyber security, machine learning and artificial intelligence, connected cars, and in asset tracking to compliment its Radar product.

Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, first put forward the idea for the town hall talks in an interview with a Birmingham, Alabama, TV station last week, five days after Cosby's sex assault trial ended in a hung jury. The proposal drew immediate criticism from a lawyer representing some of the dozens of women who have leveled sex assault accusations at the 79-year-old entertainer, whose long career was built on a family-friendly style of comedy.  The current propaganda that I am going to conduct a sexual assault tour is false,  Cosby said in a statement released by Wyatt on Tuesday.  Any further information about public plans will be given at the appropriate time.  Wyatt said in the TV interview last week that Cosby, once known as  America's dad  for his starring role in the 1980s TV hit  The Cosby Show,  planned to give free public appearances to address the dangers that young men face. On Tuesday, Wyatt said his comments were taken out of context and that Cosby was still sifting through speaking invitations from civic organizations and church groups. After a Los Angeles court hearing related to a civil lawsuit by a woman who has accused the comedian of sexual assault, Cosby attorney Angela Agrusa told reporters there was a  lot of miscommunication  about planned public appearances. Cosby, she said, wants to perform again but is unlikely to do so until all criminal charges are resolved.  He doesn't take lightly the charges against him,  she added. Prosecutors in Pennsylvania plan to retry Cosby on charges that he sexually assaulted Andrea Constand at his Philadelphia-area home in 2004. Some 60 women have accused him of sex assault in a string of alleged incidents dating back to the 1960s. The Pennsylvania case is the only one to result in criminal prosecution. Ten women are pursuing either sexual abuse or defamation lawsuits against Cosby. Two cases are headed for back-to-back trials in California next summer. A Los Angeles judge on Tuesday set July 30, 2018, as the trial date for a lawsuit brought by Judy Huth, who says Cosby gave her alcohol and then sexually abused her at the Playboy mansion around 1974 when she was 15. Another lawsuit, filed by former model Chloe Goins, is scheduled for trial in June 2018.

We will not drill into oblivion,  Tim Dove, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N), told investors on Tuesday at a J.P. Morgan energy conference in New York.  Pioneer, one of the biggest operators in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, is confident that OPEC leader Saudi Arabia will not let oil prices remain near current levels for too long, Dove said.  Newer operating efficiencies allow Pioneer to continue to drill more, he said. But if prices were to remain depressed for a longer term,  we can pare away and still be a growth company even in a $45 (per barrel) environment.   For shale producers that set their 2017 capital budgets when oil was selling at $50 or more a barrel, the recent drop has threatened ambitions to generate enough cash flow to justify the higher capital spending. Many are still not earning enough to cover their higher 2017 budgets and oil's latest decline is causing angst among some investors. U.S. oil prices closed Tuesday at $44.24 per barrel, up 2 percent but down from highs near $53 a barrel in April.  WPX Energy Inc (WPX.N), a growing Permian and Bakken shale producer, next year plans to add between one and three drilling rigs to its existing 10-rig plan for 2017. It could reduce that plan to between zero to three additional rigs if weak pricing holds, said Clay Gaspar, WPX's chief operating officer.  Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), the largest acreage holder in the Permian, has no intention of scaling back on capital spending plans, said CEO Vicki Hollub. The company hopes to be cash flow neutral, that is, cover its capital budget and shareholder dividends from cash flow, at $50 a barrel for the year.  But Oxy's price scenarios show it still could achieve that goal at $40 a barrel average price for the year by cutting $1 billion from its capital spending.   We do believe we need to be prepared for a $40 environment, but we recognize the fundamentals do not support that,  Hollub said.   Doug Lawler, CEO of Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N), said the gas and oil producer is  continuously reviewing its capital plan  as it strives to become cash flow neutral. The company expects to increase end-of-year oil production by 10 percent over the end of 2016, he said. However, it will not put recent financial strides at risk.  We're not going to grow production at all cost,  said Lawler.  The opportunity in 2018 to reduce our program, to reduce that spend, is something we're very focused on.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) CEO Al Walker told another investor conference earlier this month that the oil industry has shown it can adjust to sharp price changes and could do it again.   We can manage the $43  (per barrel price), Walker said.  We can take capital off the market, we can take production down, we can reduce our costs - because we did it the last time.

Stanislav Cherchesov's side slumped out of the World Cup warm-up event on Saturday with a 2-1 loss to Mexico that featured shaky goalkeeping and missed chances. With less than a year to the World Cup finals, Russia are left with few options to add depth to their squad and unlike other countries fighting for a spot in the tournament, they will not have the chance to gauge their strength in qualifying.  We won’t have new players tomorrow. This is our main team,  Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who also heads the Russian Football Union (RFU), said last week, R-Sport news agency reported.  Aliens aren’t going to fly in to play for Russia.  Russia’s Confederations Cup elimination adds to a long list of poor performances on the international stage, including early exits from last year’s European Championship and the 2014 World Cup finals, tournaments in which they failed to win a match.  President Vladimir Putin suggested this month that the presence of foreign players in the Russian Premier League could be thwarting the development of homegrown talent and conceded the country had not paid enough attention to youth development. Russia also has work to do to increase participation levels.  Some 2.7 million people -- approximately 1.8 percent of the population -- play soccer in Russia, the RFU said this year. In comparison, just over 11 million people in England, or about 20 percent of the population, say they play some form of soccer, according to a 2015 report by the English FA. For some Russian officials, only time can turn the tables for their national team, which slipped to a record low of 63rd in FIFA's world rankings this month. “Youth sport collapsed in the 1990s,” lawmaker Dmitry Svishchev, who serves on the Russian parliament’s sport and physical culture committee, told Reuters, referring to the decade of political and economic instability following the Soviet Union’s collapse. “This system started working again in the early 2000s, and I hope the results of this will show in the next five years.” All the players in Russia’s Confederations Cup squad play in the domestic league, a situation some pundits say has sheltered them from high-calibre competition and ultimately hindered their development. “Our domestic championship does not produce good enough players for us to even think we can contend for anything,” former Soviet national team player and commentator Yevgeny Lovchev told Reuters. “The league is weak. CSKA (Moscow), Spartak (Moscow) and Zenit (St Petersburg) only play among themselves and players have no opportunities to learn,  he added, referring to the clubs who dominated the Russian championship last season.  In European competition, only two Russian clubs have reached the Champions League quarter-finals, with CSKA Moscow exiting in the last eight in 2010, 14 years after Spartak Moscow reached the same stage. With the possible exception of 21-year-old CSKA Moscow midfielder Aleksandr Golovin, who has been linked by British media with a move to Arsenal, few Russian players look capable of playing at top European clubs.   “No one abroad wants our players,” Lovchev said.  After Russia’s Confederations Cup elimination, Cherchesov said his players had made a “qualitative leap” since last year’s dismal Euros and he hoped they could learn from the experience.  Not everyone was so upbeat, however. “We shouldn’t have expectations,” Lovchev said. “We should only expect that our guys step onto the pitch and fight for their country.” Reporting by Moscow Newsroom; Editing by Ken Ferris and Toby Davis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-confederations-russia-idUSKBN19I2RT"},

They attributed further selling on lower wholesale beef values that could weigh on this week's cash prices.                  June        , which will expire on Friday, closed 1.875 cents per pound lower at 119.600 cents. Most actively traded  August         finished 3.250 cents lower at 115.025 cents, and below its 10-day moving average of 116.375 cents.     CME live cattle on Wednesday will resume its normal 3.000-cent limit after failing to settle at the expanded 4.500-cent limit on Tuesday.     Last week, market-ready, or cash, cattle in the U.S. Plains moved at $118 to $123 per cwt.     Investors await Wednesday morning's Fed Cattle Exchange sale of 2,554 animals. A week ago there, a small number of cattle at the exchange brought $123 per cwt.     Bearish investors expect packers to pay less for market-ready, or cash, cattle than last week given seasonally sluggish wholesale beef demand.      Packers will also need fewer cattle as plants prepare to close during the U.S. Independence Day holiday.     Market bulls believe extremely profitable packer margins, and fewer cattle for sale than last week, might underpin some cash prices.

The benchmark S&P; 500 posted its biggest one-day drop in about six weeks and closed at its lowest point since May 31. Major indexes extended losses after U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell decided to put off a planned vote on a bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act until after the Senate's July 4 recess. The healthcare legislation, which has encountered resistance from several Republicans, is the first plank of Trump's domestic policy agenda, with investors eager for him to move onto his other plans including tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation.  Promises for such domestic polices helped fuel a 13.1-percent rise for the benchmark S&P; 500 since Trump's Nov. 8 election. “The market likes certainty, and now there’s uncertainty,  said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions in New York.

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, turned in the remaining 40 percent of their firearms in Mesetas, a mountainous area in southeastern Colombia. The roughly 7,000 former fighters have pledged to continue their struggle as a political movement. The 7,132 weapons will be stored in containers until they are molded into a monument for peace. Explosives and bigger weapons are being cleared from caches nationwide and a few guns will remain for security at 26 camps until they close on Aug. 1.   Today doesn't end the existence of the FARC, it ends our armed struggle,  said Rodrigo Londono, the FARC's top commander, who goes by his nom de guerre Timochenko.   Farewell to arms, farewell to war, welcome to peace.  Financed by drug trafficking, kidnapping for ransom and extortion, the FARC had about 17,000 combatants in the 1990s, capable of launching military attacks close to Bogota, the capital.

Our peace is real, and it's irreversible.   Although the government promises to provide protection, the FARC is concerned about security. Thousands of former guerrillas were assassinated by paramilitaries after joining a political party during a peace attempt in the 1980s. Santos, who took office in 2010, began secret talks with FARC commanders that led to negotiations in Cuba and a final peace accord late last year. He is trying for a similar accord with the National Liberation Army (ELN).  Peace with the FARC, however, is unlikely to end violence in Colombia as the lucrative cocaine business has given rise to criminal gangs and traffickers.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was putting on hold plans to introduce legislation that would have demanded a second referendum. Sturgeon, whose Scottish National Party wants to break Scotland's 300-year-old union with England, had been seeking a referendum in late 2018 or early 2019, ahead of Britain's EU exit which is due in March 2019.   We will not seek to introduce the legislation for an independence referendum immediately,  Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament.  The Scottish government will reset the plan I set out.  She later told the BBC she believed that meant another secession vote, if it took place, would most likely be before 2021 when the current Scottish legislative term ends.  I do think that we are talking potentially within this parliament, but I don't want to make that judgment now.  Sturgeon's party lost 21 of its 56 seats in the United Kingdom's parliament at Westminster in the June 8 election. In the days after the election she acknowledged that her insistence on a second independence referendum had lost the SNP votes.   None of the questions raised by Brexit are answered by ripping Scotland out of our own union of nations,  Ruth Davidson, Scottish Conservatives leader, told the Scottish parliament. In March, the Scottish parliament backed Sturgeon's demand to hold a new referendum, but British Prime Minister Theresa May had refused to enter into discussions on the proposal. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, addresses the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, Scotland June 27, 2017.Russell Cheyne What I think Nicola Sturgeon should be saying today is that she's going to completely take off the table the question of Indy Ref 2, a second independence referendum in Scotland,  May said.  Now is the time for the United Kingdom to be pulling together, not being driven apart.  Scottish Independence? However, Sturgeon said she intended to offer Scots a fresh choice on secession as soon as it was clear what Brexit meant. Slideshow (6 Images) We will - in good faith - redouble our efforts and put our shoulder to the wheel in seeking to influence the Brexit talks in a way that protects Scotland's interests,  Sturgeon said, adding she wanted Scotland to stay in the European single market. It is unclear, however, whether she will be able to reinvigorate the independence cause, given the divisive nature of referendums per se and the political chaos into which Britain has been thrown by Brexit.  The implications of Brexit are so potentially far reaching that, as they become clearer, I think people will increasingly demand that choice (on secession),  Sturgeon said.  We face a Brexit we did not vote for, and in a form more extreme than most would have imagined just one year ago.  Scots voted against independence by 55 to 45 percent in 2014 but the 2016 Brexit referendum called the future of the United Kingdom into question because England and Wales voted to leave while Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay. Sturgeon told the Scottish assembly she had listened carefully to those who were concerned about Brexit but had not wanted another independence vote immediately and were worried about a lack of political clarity. She said a choice needed to be offered, but the timing needed to be more cautious.  The Scottish government remains committed strongly to the principle of giving Scotland a choice at the end of this process but I want to reassure people that our proposal is not for a referendum now, or before there is sufficient clarity about the options,  Sturgeon said.

Citing accounts of seven residents of Marawi City who either escaped or were rescued, the military said some hostages were forced to convert to Islam, carry wounded fighters to mosques, and marry militants of the Maute group loyal to Islamic State.  This is what is happening inside, this is very evident,  military spokesman Jo-Ar Herrera told a news conference.   These are evil personalities.  Their accounts, which could not be immediately verified, are the latest harrowing accounts to come out of a conflict zone that the military has been unable to clear for five weeks, as well-armed and organized rebels fight off soldiers with sniper rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Some escapees say bodies of residents have been left in the streets, some for weeks, and civilians are distressed by government air strikes and artillery bombardments that have reduced parts of Marawi to rubble. The protracted seizure has worried the region about the extent the Islamic State's agenda may have gained traction in the southern Philippines, which is more used to banditry, piracy and separatism than radical Islam. The rebels' combat capability, access to heavy weapons and use of foreign fighters have raised fears in the mainly Catholic country that the Marawi battle could just be the start of a wider campaign, and it could be presented by Maute as a triumph to aid their recruitment. President Rodrigo Duterte, reappearing in public after a week-long absence, said he was deeply saddened by the crisis and promised Marawi would be rebuilt. He said he had cousins who were members of the Maute group, one of which had been killed, and his decision to declare martial law on Mindanao was justified, because he was aware of exactly what the extremists would do.  I know the deployment of snipers and where they hid their firearms. I already had the complete picture and I knew that would be a long fight,  he said in a speech. Duterte said he understood why Muslim separatists had fought the government, but could not comprehend Islamic State's radical doctrine.  What's painful for me, a fractured ideology entered. All that they want is to kill and destroy, how can we live with that?  he said. Heavy clashes broke out on Tuesday as the battle entered its sixth week, with intense bombings by planes on a shrinking rebel zone. A Philippines army aircraft releases a bomb during an airstrike as government troops continue their assault against insurgents from the Maute group in Marawi city June 27, 2017.Jorge SilvaNo Negotiations The government ruled out negotiations after reports that Abdullah Maute, one of two brothers who formed the militant group carrying their name, wanted to trade a Catholic priest hostage for his parents arrested this month. The military said on Saturday Abdullah Maute had fled. Taking advantage of a short truce to mark the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday, eight Muslim leaders met briefly on Sunday with Maute. The Philippine Daily Inquirer said he had asked for his father, Cayamora Maute, and influential businesswoman mother, Farhana Maute, to be freed, in a swap for Father Teresito  Chito  Soganub. Slideshow (7 Images)But presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said deals with militants were against government policy, and anyone trying to bargain had no authority to do so. The military's public relations machine has been insisting that the rebel leadership was crumbling, saying top commanders had escaped or were killed in action, and the group was fraught with infighting. Military officers, however, accept they lack solid proof. The army said there were reported sightings of the departure from the battle of Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State's anointed Southeast Asian  emir , which Abella said showed he was not committed to his cause.  It would be a clear sign of his cowardice,  he said.  It may only be a matter of time before they disintegrate.  Fighting has raged in the town since an operation to arrest Hapilon went wrong on May 23, leading to the government losing not just Hapilon, but control of Marawi. Official figures show 70 servicemen, 27 civilians and 290 militants have since been killed and 246,000 people displaced. Duterte said seeing Marawi bombed was too much to bear.  Do not think I am enjoying my life now,  he said.  I do not watch TV anymore, I turn it off or I transfer to cartoons.

The hearing gave top executives from stock exchanges, fund companies and brokerages a chance to detail their often competing issues to members of the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets. One recurring topic in the three-hour hearing was the rebates exchanges pay to brokers that send them resting orders for others to trade against.  In simple terms, this payment to brokers when not shared with the broker's client is equivalent to a kickback,  Brad Katsuyama, chief executive officer of exchange operator IEX Group, which does not pay rebates, said in prepared remarks.  Exchanges operated by Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O), the New York Stock Exchange and Bats pay around $2.5 billion a year in rebates, and the practice is increasingly affecting the decisions brokers and exchanges make, Katsuyama said.    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff have been drafting a proposal to test reducing the maximum amount exchanges can charge brokers to execute orders on their platforms. Lowering the fee cap would also reduce the amount of rebates that exchanges could pay to brokers.     Exchanges that pay the rebates say the practice promotes liquidity and compensates market makers for taking the risk of providing it. Critics argue the payments give incentives for brokers to send their customers' orders to exchanges with the biggest rebates rather than to exchanges that would get the best result for the end clients.    Executives from Bats, which is owned by CBOE Holdings (CBOE.O), and Nasdaq said rebates are an important means for attracting liquidity from market makers, but that a one-size-fits-all approach might not be the best way to go. They said there is ample liquidity in the stocks of large companies, and the rebates for those orders could be reduced without much effect. But the stocks of many small and mid-sized companies are much harder to trade, and reducing the payments for them would further hamper trading, they said.  Ari Rubenstein, head of high-frequency trading firm Global Trading Systems, which is one of the largest market makers on the New York Stock Exchange, agreed that if rebates were to go away, liquidity for small- and mid-cap stocks would decline.

Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) party won a large majority in parliamentary elections this month, consolidating his presidential win in May. Like Macron, most LREM lawmakers had never previously held elected office. About six years younger on average than the previous batch of MPs, the new lawmakers are also less male-dominated, with a record 223 women out of 577 deputies. Ethnic minorities were also better represented: 35 lawmakers compared with 10 in the previous legislature, according to France 24 TV. Lawmakers picked Francois de Rugy as speaker of the National Assembly, a role that influences parliament's agenda. In his opening speech to the assembly, De Rugy, a former Green politician who rallied behind Macron's presidential bid, alluded to the record low turnout of less than 50 percent seen in the parliamentary election.  For the first time in the Fifth Republic's history, we were elected by a minority of French people,  he said.  This gives us the responsibility to earn back the trust that decades of economic and social crises have eroded.

Ministers have made no secret that they do not expect good news and anticipate broad spending cuts, blaming the previous Socialist-led government for letting finances slip in its last months in office. France's other parties, including the Republicans and the former ruling Socialists, have been left deeply fragmented in the wake of Macron's successes, which have upset France's political landscape. Socialist Party head Jean-Christophe Cambadelis said on Twitter that fragmentation of the National Assembly into eight political groups was  a recipe for crisis .

The S&P; CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20metropolitan areas rose 5.7 percent in April on a year-over-year basis after a 5.9 percent gain in March, which  matched the fastest pace in nearly three years. April's result fell short of the 5.9 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Despite coming in below expectations, David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P; Dow Jones Indices, said the supply of homes has barely kept up with demand and inventory of new or existing homes for sale had diminished to a 4-month supply. That is likely to keep home prices on the rise.  We hear that developers are having trouble finding the lots they want and finding the labor they want. With those two constraints, inventory is going to stay tight for a while,  said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica.  The National Association of Realtors reported last week that the inventory of existing homes available for sale rose in May by 2.1 percent to 1.96 million from the previous month. Still, that was 8.4 percent below last year's level, and inventory has declined for consecutive 24 months on a year-over-year basis. Prices in the 20 cities covered by Case-Shiller rose 0.3 percent in April after seasonal adjustment, the survey showed, short of expectations for a 0.4 percent increase.

Chief election officer Klement Zguri said the final official preliminary tally from Sunday's vote showed the Socialists won 48 percent, or 74 seats in the 140-seat parliament, and the main opposition Democratic Party 29 percent, or 43 seats. The Democratic Party and a smaller third party, the Socialist Integration Movement (SIM), which won 14 percent, or 19 seats, both accused the Socialists of buying votes in an election marred by low turnout of 46.72 percent. The Socialists deny the accusation.  After our first term, much remains to be done, and we plan to get back to work immediately, to continue reforms, and to expand the economy and create jobs,  Prime Minister Edi Rama said in a statement. NATO member Albania's new government must implement sweeping judicial reforms to root out widespread graft in order to make progress in its bid to join the EU. Albania has also become the leading supplier of herbal cannabis smuggled into the EU, according to Europol, but tackling the trade is likely to prove challenging.

Basha sounded a less conciliatory note on Tuesday, telling a televised news conference:  Criminality and dirty money flowed freely, this election was bought on a massive scale.  Basha said he would run again for his party's leadership in July. EU leaders said the election was held in a  calm and orderly manner  but urged international observers to provide a fuller report on the allegations of vote-buying and pressure on voters. Brussels also reminded Tirana that  the continuation of justice reform and the fight against drug trafficking and cultivation will be of particular importance  in its pursuit of closer EU ties.

U.S. President Donald Trump never owned the project, but his company had signed a long-term branding and management deal with the building's developer, Talon International Development Inc, which defaulted on its construction loan last year. JCF Capital ULC earlier this year bought units in the 65-story Trump International Hotel & Tower that were not owned by individuals in a court-run sale. In a statement announcing the buyout on Tuesday, JCF Capital did not say whether it had reached a deal yet with another group to take over the management and branding of the building in Toronto's financial district. Sources told Reuters earlier in June that Marriott International Inc's (MAR.O) St. Regis brand was the lead bidder to take over the brand and management rights, with one saying that the Trump Organization had agreed to sever its connections.  The Trump International Hotel and Tower is seen in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada June 27, 2017.Chris Helgren We are pleased to have reached this agreement with JCF and have enjoyed our relationship with them as the new owners of this property,  Eric Danziger, chief executive of Trump Hotels, said in the JCF statement. JCF is a vehicle created by Juniper Capital Partners LLC and Cowie Capital Partners Inc to buy the tower.

The tower, which opened in 2012 after construction delays, has had a troubled history, including lawsuits from unhappy investors and has also been the scene of several protests against President Trump's policies and statements. His business connections around the world have sparked lawsuits and criticism about potential conflicts of interest since he took office in January.  Since its opening, Talon had sold less than half of the tower's residential condos, and the hotel's occupancy rates have been lower than some investors in the rooms had hoped. A court last year ordered the developer to pay damages to one investor for  negligent misrepresentation  and for another sale to be rescinded.

The S&P; CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20metropolitan areas rose 5.7 percent in April on a year-over-year basis after a 5.9 percent gain in March, which  matched the fastest pace in nearly three years. April's result fell short of the 5.9 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Despite coming in below expectations, David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P; Dow Jones Indices, said the supply of homes has barely kept up with demand and inventory of new or existing homes for sale had diminished to a 4-month supply. That is likely to keep home prices on the rise.  We hear that developers are having trouble finding the lots they want and finding the labor they want. With those two constraints, inventory is going to stay tight for a while,  said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica.  The National Association of Realtors reported last week that the inventory of existing homes available for sale rose in May by 2.1 percent to 1.96 million from the previous month. Still, that was 8.4 percent below last year's level, and inventory has declined for consecutive 24 months on a year-over-year basis. Prices in the 20 cities covered by Case-Shiller rose 0.3 percent in April after seasonal adjustment, the survey showed, short of expectations for a 0.4 percent increase. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, prices increased 0.9 percent from March.   Secondary tech hubs like Seattle, Portland and Dallas reported the highest annual gains among the 20 metropolitan areas measured by the index.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was putting on hold plans to introduce legislation that would have demanded a second referendum. Sturgeon, whose Scottish National Party wants to break Scotland's 300-year-old union with England, had been seeking a referendum in late 2018 or early 2019, ahead of Britain's EU exit which is due in March 2019.   We will not seek to introduce the legislation for an independence referendum immediately,  Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament.  The Scottish government will reset the plan I set out.  She later told the BBC she believed that meant another secession vote, if it took place, would most likely be before 2021 when the current Scottish legislative term ends.  I do think that we are talking potentially within this parliament, but I don't want to make that judgment now.  Sturgeon's party lost 21 of its 56 seats in the United Kingdom's parliament at Westminster in the June 8 election. In the days after the election she acknowledged that her insistence on a second independence referendum had lost the SNP votes.   None of the questions raised by Brexit are answered by ripping Scotland out of our own union of nations,  Ruth Davidson, Scottish Conservatives leader, told the Scottish parliament. In March, the Scottish parliament backed Sturgeon's demand to hold a new referendum, but British Prime Minister Theresa May had refused to enter into discussions on the proposal. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, addresses the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, Scotland June 27, 2017.Russell Cheyne What I think Nicola Sturgeon should be saying today is that she's going to completely take off the table the question of Indy Ref 2, a second independence referendum in Scotland,  May said.  Now is the time for the United Kingdom to be pulling together, not being driven apart.  Scottish Independence? However, Sturgeon said she intended to offer Scots a fresh choice on secession as soon as it was clear what Brexit meant. Slideshow (6 Images) We will - in good faith - redouble our efforts and put our shoulder to the wheel in seeking to influence the Brexit talks in a way that protects Scotland's interests,  Sturgeon said, adding she wanted Scotland to stay in the European single market. It is unclear, however, whether she will be able to reinvigorate the independence cause, given the divisive nature of referendums per se and the political chaos into which Britain has been thrown by Brexit.  The implications of Brexit are so potentially far reaching that, as they become clearer, I think people will increasingly demand that choice (on secession),  Sturgeon said.  We face a Brexit we did not vote for, and in a form more extreme than most would have imagined just one year ago.  Scots voted against independence by 55 to 45 percent in 2014 but the 2016 Brexit referendum called the future of the United Kingdom into question because England and Wales voted to leave while Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay. Sturgeon told the Scottish assembly she had listened carefully to those who were concerned about Brexit but had not wanted another independence vote immediately and were worried about a lack of political clarity. She said a choice needed to be offered, but the timing needed to be more cautious.  The Scottish government remains committed strongly to the principle of giving Scotland a choice at the end of this process but I want to reassure people that our proposal is not for a referendum now, or before there is sufficient clarity about the options,  Sturgeon said.

The hearing gave top executives from stock exchanges, fund companies and brokerages a chance to detail their often competing issues to members of the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets. One recurring topic in the three-hour hearing was the rebates exchanges pay to brokers that send them resting orders for others to trade against.  In simple terms, this payment to brokers when not shared with the broker's client is equivalent to a kickback,  Brad Katsuyama, chief executive officer of exchange operator IEX Group, which does not pay rebates, said in prepared remarks.  Exchanges operated by Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O), the New York Stock Exchange and Bats pay around $2.5 billion a year in rebates, and the practice is increasingly affecting the decisions brokers and exchanges make, Katsuyama said.    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff have been drafting a proposal to test reducing the maximum amount exchanges can charge brokers to execute orders on their platforms. Lowering the fee cap would also reduce the amount of rebates that exchanges could pay to brokers.     Exchanges that pay the rebates say the practice promotes liquidity and compensates market makers for taking the risk of providing it. Critics argue the payments give incentives for brokers to send their customers' orders to exchanges with the biggest rebates rather than to exchanges that would get the best result for the end clients.    Executives from Bats, which is owned by CBOE Holdings (CBOE.O), and Nasdaq said rebates are an important means for attracting liquidity from market makers, but that a one-size-fits-all approach might not be the best way to go. They said there is ample liquidity in the stocks of large companies, and the rebates for those orders could be reduced without much effect. But the stocks of many small and mid-sized companies are much harder to trade, and reducing the payments for them would further hamper trading, they said.  Ari Rubenstein, head of high-frequency trading firm Global Trading Systems, which is one of the largest market makers on the New York Stock Exchange, agreed that if rebates were to go away, liquidity for small- and mid-cap stocks would decline.

Justin Sullivan, 21, of Morganton, was sentenced in federal court in Asheville on one count of attempting to commit an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries, the Justice Department said in a statement. Sullivan had pleaded guilty in November 2016, and the agreement with prosecutors called for the life sentence. Prosecutors said Sullivan conspired with Junaid Hussain, a British hacker who was an online recruiter of people to carry out attacks on behalf of the militant group Islamic State. Hussain was killed by a U.S. air strike in Syria in 2015. Islamic State has carried out or inspired attacks in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Sullivan had discussed his plot online with an undercover federal agent, making plans to buy a semi-automatic rifle at a gun show and discussing potential targets. Sullivan said he would use the rifle at a concert, bar or club in an effort to kill as many as 1,000 people, the Justice Department statement said. At Sullivan's request, the undercover agent sent a homemade silencer to his home. Sullivan's mother opened the package. When his parents questioned him about the silencer, Sullivan offered to pay the agent to kill them so they would not interfere with his plans, the statement said. He was arrested in June 2015. At the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Martin Reidinger likened Sullivan's plan to the deadly nightclub attack in Orlando in 2016. But he said his plot to use a silencer to kill as many people as possible made it even more sinister, prosecutors said in their statement. Sullivan told the judge he was not “a cold-blooded killer,” the Charlotte Observer newspaper reported. Sullivan also faces a murder charge in state court in the 2014 death of his neighbor, John Bailey Clark. Prosecutors, who plan to seek the death penalty in that case, have said Sullivan told investigators he stole his father's rifle for use in that crime.

U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh of the Northern District of California in San Jose denied Qualcomm's motion to dismiss the FTC's lawsuit, saying the agency's allegations would amount to anticompetitive behavior on Qualcomm's part if proved true. In response, Qualcomm said the case is still in its early stages.  FTC will have the burden to prove its claims, which we continue to believe are without merit,  Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement on Tuesday.

Qualcomm asked Koh to throw out the case, arguing that even if all the FTC's allegations were true, they would not amount to wrongdoing.

At least 79 people died when a fire that started in a fridge freezer engulfed the 24-storey Grenfell Tower block on June 14, trapping many inside their apartments as they slept. Police on Tuesday named a five-year-old boy as the youngest of the dead so far formally identified.  The devastating inferno has raised concerns about the cladding used on the facades of buildings, mainly for insulation or to improve their appearance, prompting urgent safety tests to be carried out on similar tower blocks around the country.  Right now, we are at a position where 95 buildings in 32 local authority areas have now failed the tests and that remains a 100 percent failure rate,  May's spokesman told reporters.  The prime minister said there would need to be a major national investigation into what had gone wrong when cladding which is failing the tests had been fitted on buildings across the country over a number of decades.  The Grenfell disaster, and May's initially slow response to it, has stirred widespread anger and intensified criticism of her leadership after a botched snap election that cost her Conservative Party its parliamentary majority. Five-year-old Isaac Paulous, who died in the Grenfell Tower fire, is seen in this undated photograph received via the Metropolitan Police, in London, Britain June 27, 2017.  Metropolitan Police/Handout/Via REUTERSHer government has promised a public inquiry into what happened in addition to tests on some 600 buildings. The officer in charge of the police investigation has said exterior cladding at Grenfell Tower had failed all fire safety tests and that police say they would consider criminal charges, including manslaughter, over the fire.   U.S. firm Arconic Inc said it was stopping global sales of its Reynobond PE cladding, which was used in Grenfell Tower, for use in high-rise buildings after the fire.

In a securities filing, Vale said shareholders approved all seven items on the corporate reorganization agenda, which is a first step toward giving the company dispersed share ownership - where no shareholder controls decision making at the firm.  The change represents a milestone in a country long hobbled by corporate governance abuses and reorganizations that hampered minority investors in most cases. Reuters reported the plan on Jan. 19, citing people familiar with it. The plan also puts a limit to the meddling of politicians in Vale - an aspect that weighed on the company's stock during former President Dilma Rousseff's five years in office. Still, the government will keep a golden share, allowing it to fend off hostile takeover attempts and shape strategic decisions. Investors expect Tuesday's vote to improve investors' perception of Vale, translating into a faster convergence of Vale's share prices to those of rivals, and a decline in the Brazilian miner's cost of capital. In the filing, Vale said the proposed conversion of preferred shares into a single, common stock was approved with the equivalent of 68 percent of preferred shares that participated in the ballot, well above the 54 percent threshold set when the plan was first announced in February. 'Encouraging'  Preferred shares gained 2.4 percent to 26.36 reais, while Vale's common shares added 2.5 percent to 28.15 reais in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday. Under terms of the conversion, holders of Vale's Class A preferred shares will receive 0.9342 of common stock. Investors have 45 days to convert their shares, needing the equivalent of at least 54.09 percent of preferred shares in circulation to go ahead, the filing said. In addition, minority holders voted to allow controlling shareholders grouped under holding company Valepar SA to keep control of Vale for another three and a half years. Vale will eventually absorb Valepar, facilitating the stock conversion. A simpler shareholder structure in which Vale's board, and not Valepar, will decide strategy, and higher liquidity stemming from the end of the Valepar lockup period could trigger a sharp rise in Vale's market capitalization, analysts said.  Results were encouraging with the proposal approved and while there are other important steps ahead ... we are encouraged to see progress on this front, and believe this will be well received by the market,  said Leonardo Correa, a senior analyst with Banco BTG Pactual in São Paulo. To ensure completion of the plan, Vale would pay owners of Valepar a 10 percent premium for their shares, implying a 3 percent dilution for all shareholders.

U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh of the Northern District of California in San Jose denied Qualcomm's motion to dismiss the FTC's lawsuit, saying the agency's allegations would amount to anticompetitive behavior on Qualcomm's part if proved true. In response, Qualcomm said the case is still in its early stages.  FTC will have the burden to prove its claims, which we continue to believe are without merit,  Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement on Tuesday. The FTC sued Qualcomm in January, alleging the company  engaged in anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly on the chips that let cell phones connect to mobile data networks.] The FTC highlighted Qualcomm's  no license, no chips  policy under which the San Diego company refuses to sell chips unless customers also sign a patent license agreement and pay Qualcomm fees. Qualcomm refused to grant licenses to its rivals in order to keep a monopoly, the FTC alleged. Qualcomm asked Koh to throw out the case, arguing that even if all the FTC's allegations were true, they would not amount to wrongdoing.  Qualcomm, the largest independent maker of chips used in smartphones, is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), which are not parties to the case, filed briefs opposing Qualcomm's attempt to the have the case dismissed.  Koh rejected Qualcomm's arguments, ruling that the FTC had  adequately alleged  anticompetitive behavior.  We look forward to further proceedings in which we will be able to develop a more accurate factual record,  Qualcomm's Rosenberg said in the statement.  Separately, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion in January. Last week, Apple argued Qualcomm's chip licenses are invalid under a ruling last month from the U.S. Supreme Court. Apple's contract manufacturers such as Foxconn stopped paying Qualcomm as that case proceeds, which in turn prompted Qualcomm to sue the contract manufacturers. In addition to the complaint from the FTC, Qualcomm has faced a series of antitrust rulings and investigations from regulators across the globe, including China and South Korea. The FTC's case is No. 5:17-cv-00220 in the Northern District of California.

At least 79 people died when a fire that started in a fridge freezer engulfed the 24-storey Grenfell Tower block on June 14, trapping many inside their apartments as they slept. Police on Tuesday named a five-year-old boy as the youngest of the dead so far formally identified.  The devastating inferno has raised concerns about the cladding used on the facades of buildings, mainly for insulation or to improve their appearance, prompting urgent safety tests to be carried out on similar tower blocks around the country.  Right now, we are at a position where 95 buildings in 32 local authority areas have now failed the tests and that remains a 100 percent failure rate,  May's spokesman told reporters.  The prime minister said there would need to be a major national investigation into what had gone wrong when cladding which is failing the tests had been fitted on buildings across the country over a number of decades.  The Grenfell disaster, and May's initially slow response to it, has stirred widespread anger and intensified criticism of her leadership after a botched snap election that cost her Conservative Party its parliamentary majority.

The officer in charge of the police investigation has said exterior cladding at Grenfell Tower had failed all fire safety tests and that police say they would consider criminal charges, including manslaughter, over the fire.   U.S. firm Arconic Inc said it was stopping global sales of its Reynobond PE cladding, which was used in Grenfell Tower, for use in high-rise buildings after the fire.

On the deck of Thunder Horse, they work two-week shifts, drink seawater from a desalination plant, and eat ribs and chicken ferried in by boat. On the ocean floor, robots provide remote eyes and arms as drills extract up to 265,000 barrels per day.  There's a whole city below us,  said Jim Pearl, Marine Team Leader on the platform. This is just one of the four Gulf of Mexico platforms on which BP has staked its future in U.S. oil production. Seven years after its Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, BP is betting tens of billions of dollars on the prospect that it can slash the costs of offshore drilling by half or more - just as shale oil producers have done onshore. The firm says it can do that while it continues to pay an estimated $61 billion in total costs and damages from the worst spill in history - and without compromising safety. BP's Gulf platforms are key to a global strategy calling for up to $17 billion in annual investments through 2021 to increase production by about 5 percent each year, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley recently told investors.  Our strategy is to take this investment that we spent so much money building, and keep it full  to the platform's capacity, Richard Morrison, BP's regional president for the Gulf of Mexico, told Reuters during the first tour of a BP Gulf drilling platform since the disaster.  We're also exploring for larger pools of oil.  BP's deepwater double-down is all the more striking for the contrast to its chief competitors, who have cooled on offshore investments in light of the lower costs and quicker returns of onshore shale plays. While BP has some onshore U.S. developments, the firm is notably absent from the industry's rush into shale oil fields of the West Texas Permian Basin. Majors including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) have maintained Gulf operations but focused expansions on U.S. shale. Exxon Mobil doubled its acreage in the Permian in a deal earlier this year. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N) and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) have pulled out of Gulf drilling entirely in recent years. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) took a $435-million dollar write-down in May on its Shenandoah project in the Gulf, deciding it could not profit with oil prices hovering at about $50 a barrel.  In a $50 to $60 world, we always felt like greenfield development, in the Gulf in particular, was fairly challenged,  Anadarko CEO Al Walker told investors last month. Oil prices dropped steeply last week, settling in the low $40s per barrel. BP says its next Gulf development - the $9 billion Mad Dog phase two - would be profitable even at $40 a barrel. As recently as 2013, BP reported that it could not start new deepwater Gulf projects at prices lower than $100 a barrel. A Billion Barrels In time, BP's offshore expansion could produce a huge payoff. The firm announced last month that it had discovered an additional billion barrels of oil below its four audaciously named Gulf platforms - Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Na Kika and Mad Dog. The find - worth more than $40 billion at today's market prices - amounts to more than three times the proven reserves at the Na Kika field, or the equivalent of three new fields in the Gulf.  It seems like every ten years there's another breakthrough  that unlocks more Gulf oil, Morrison said on the deck of Thunder Horse. Over his shoulder, a drillship three miles away tapped a new well that will feed production into the massive platform. In the wake of the 2010 BP disaster, deepwater production was curtailed by a six-month U.S. government moratorium on drilling and a longer period of uncertainty about regulation. But output has rebounded to new record highs as projects sanctioned years ago start operations and existing hubs such as Thunder Horse expand. Representative Steve Scalise (R-LA) views BP's Thunder Horse Oil Platform in the Gulf of Mexico, from the air, 150 miles from the Louisiana coast in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters June 26, 2017.   Chris Bond/Handout via REUTERSBP's big new discovery is key to its slashing of estimated per-barrel costs, as are a host of drilling innovations and more favorable deals with service providers. For eight decades, geologists have used seismic imaging to estimate oil and gas reserves beneath the rocky undersea terrain. BP used its own new technology for the billion-barrel discovery. Called full waveform inversion, the technique uses massive amounts of data to create a high-resolution model of reserves that were previously hidden beneath salt deposits. The firm also aims to tap those reserves without building new multi-billion-dollar platforms. At Thunder Horse and other platforms, BP is installing wellheads on the seabed and connecting them to pipelines that rise up to existing platforms, like the legs of a spider. These  tiebacks  allow producers to feed oil from remote regions of fields that previously went untapped. Other design changes helped BP hold down the investment in Mad Dog's second phase from an initially estimated $20 billion to just $9 billion, the company said. Such savings are part of the equation BP uses to estimate the platform's profitability at oil prices of $40 a barrel.  Slideshow (5 Images)The struggles of deepwater oil service firms - who were forced to cut prices after per-barrel prices tanked in 2014 - are also keeping BP's expansion costs low.  If you're going to be building an offshore Gulf of Mexico platform, now is the time to be doing it,  said Norm MacDonald, portfolio manager for Invesco's energy fund, which has increased its stake in BP, its second-largest holding. Other funds remain leery of offshore investments because of the longer wait for a return in a volatile industry. Shale has a  liquidity premium  because producers can make smaller investments and recoup them sooner, within two or three years, said Michael Roomberg, a portfolio analyst at Miller-Howard Investments. Tie-backs and other advances, however, could accelerate deepwater returns and help narrow the liquidity gap with shale, MacDonald said.  Cost Cutting, Safety Concerns BP's growing deepwater investments irk some environmentalists, who say the company has fought paying what it owes to restore shorelines and communities damaged by its massive spill. They also see the threat of another disaster.  They never really fulfilled those promises, and people are very skeptical about them expanding drilling,  said Raleigh Hoke, campaign director at Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans. Richard Sears - who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling - said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices.  The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision-making and slipshod safety systems than cost-cutting, said Sears, who previously managed production projects at Shell. BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill, introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices, among other measures. The company says it cannot precisely estimate new spending on safety since the spill because its efforts are integrated into many parts of the company. In a glassed-in drilling shack on the Thunder Horse platform, operators stay connected to a new onshore command center in Houston that BP designed to monitor data from offshore wells. On the deck below sits a blowout preventer, a room-sized piece of equipment that would soon be fitted on the wellhead of a drilling site, two miles under water.  But first it would need a safety inspection - unlike the blowout preventer that infamously failed to contain the 2010 spill, which federal regulators have said had not been inspected in years.

It does not include people who use the Instagram or WhatsApp networks but not Facebook. The company said in May that duplicate accounts, according to an estimate from last year, may have represented some 6 percent of its worldwide user base. The social network's user population dwarfs that of similar companies. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) reported in April monthly active users of 328 million, while Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) Snapchat had 166 million daily users at the end of the first quarter.

The company, which Zuckerberg started in 2004 in his college dorm room, uses its huge size advantage to lure advertisers, offering them highly targeted marketing capabilities based on its data about users.  The number of advertisers topped 5 million in April, the company said. Facebook's growth has increasingly come from outside the United States, Canada and Europe. Three years ago, those regions accounted for some 38 percent of users, compared with about 30 percent in the first quarter of this year.  To increase penetration rates in developing nations, Facebook has rolled out pared-down versions of its apps that use less data, and it has been developing solar-powered drones to extend internet connectivity around the planet.

Addressing the U.S.-India Business Council a day after Trump's first meeting with Modi in Washington, Pence stressed that India must continue to enact economic reforms to ensure the bilateral trade relationship was reciprocal. Pence echoed Trump's remarks in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, when the president called on India to relax trade barriers while taking pains to stress the importance of a strong U.S.-India relationship. Pence praised Modi's move to simplify his country's goods and services tax, strengthen protection of intellectual property rights and break down barriers to investment and market access, but said India needed to do more to create the  fair and reciprocal  trade relationship Trump sought.  We truly believe, with great respect, that the time to act is now,  Pence added.  The vice president emphasized the growing security relationship with India, both in the fight against terrorism and to ensure unimpeded movement of commerce - an allusion to shared concerns about China's territorial claims in Asia.  President Trump recognizes that the United States’ relationship with India is one of the most important strategic relationships in the 21st century,  he said. Pence pointed to fast-expanding U.S. defense sales to India and added:  The United States will continue to enable the Indian armed forces to obtain the resources and technology it needs to protect the Indian people and support security in the region.  He said the United States would sell India Sea Guardian drones, Apache attack helicopters and C-17 transport aircraft and said that the process to approve the sales was  underway as we speak.  The White House said after Trump's meeting with Modi that it had offered India the naval variant of the Predator drone made by U.S. defense contractor General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, a deal that would be worth more than $2 billion.  Such a sale of sensitive hardware must be authorized by the State Department before being sent to Congress for review.  As Modi and Trump met on Monday, a Pentagon agency said the State Department had approved the possible sale of a Boeing C-17 transport aircraft with an estimated cost of $366 million. The Apache deal dates back to 2010 when Congress was notified of a $1.4 billion potential sale of 22 Apaches to the Indian Air Force. In 2015, Boeing Co announced the order had been finalized, but did not disclose a price. The first  deliveries are scheduled for 2019.    A source familiar with the deal said the Indian Air Force has some options for additional Apaches and the Indian Army has also expressed interest in the aircraft. The White House said that if completed, the new sales would  increase bilateral defense trade to nearly $19 billion.

The opinions expressed here are her own.) By Judy Lubin June 27 (Reuters) - Donald Trump asked Senate Republicans to introduce a healthcare bill with “more heart.” They didn’t. The senators’ draft legislation, introduced last Thursday, will strip tens of millions of low-income and middle-class Americans of their health insurance. Millions more will face higher costs for lower coverage. The Congressional Budget office estimates 22 million more people will be uninsured by 2026 than would be if the Affordable Care Act remained law. The Senate bill will cut the number of people eligible for subsidies that reduce monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs for insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act health exchanges. It will defund Planned Parenthood for one year, which is an important source of preventive and primary care services for millions of low-income women and women of color. It strikes at the heart of healthcare services for the poor by ending Medicaid expansion in 2021 and changing the way states receive federal funding - another measure that will cause cuts in the program. These cuts will be on top of the $600 billion that the president’s budget seeks to eliminate from the program over the next 10 years. During his election campaign, Trump’s outreach to black voters effectively comprised the question “What do you have to lose?” That answer has become clear. The president’s effort to repeal Obamacare, coupled with rollbacks in civil-rights enforcement and massive cuts to safety net programs, are moving the country backward. The Senate health bill is the latest in a string of efforts to dismantle programs and policies that benefit all Americans, and are especially critical in closing racial disparities in health, income, education, housing and policing. The administration’s effort to do away with the Affordable Care Act is at the top of the list of actions that will hit people of color hardest. Although every racial and ethnic group benefited from greater access to insurance, the reduction in the uninsured rate for African Americans, Native Americans and Latinos, was near double that experienced by whites in the first year the law took effect. Much of this improvement was because of Medicaid expansion under the Obama program. The attack on Medicaid is especially concerning given its role in providing rural and urban children and families with access to healthcare. Medicaid covers one in five Americans, including poor adults, seniors and people with disabilities. Half of all births nationwide are covered by the program. Beyond the assault on healthcare programs, the president’s budget will cut taxes for the wealthy and increase defense spending by $54 billion while slashing programs that provide help to low-income individuals, families and communities. It will cut billions of dollars from food and nutrition, housing, and community development programs that poor families and communities rely on to meet basic living needs. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food stamps to help working families meet their nutritional needs. Funding for the program will be reduced by more than 25 percent, or $193 billion, over 10 years. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides federal funding for state-based income support and work programs for poor families, would be cut by $22 billion during the same period. And the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s budget will be slashed by nearly 15 percent or $7.4 billion. At a time the nation faces an affordable housing crisis, funding for homeless programs, direct rental assistance and home-buying programs are being drastically reduced. If Trump has his way, other programs, such as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps pay for heat and electricity, and the Community Development Block Grant program that helps revitalize economically depressed neighborhoods will be eliminated. The environmental justice program within the Environmental Protection Agency is also slated to be shut down. Low-income communities are more likely to have poorer air and water quality and have historically been targeted for dumping of toxic pollutants. Environmental justice initiatives have been key in remedying this imbalance. The Flint water crisis was an unfortunate reminder that our communities remain vulnerable to high levels of lead and other environmental inequities that have lasting impact on health. The closing of the environmental justice office at EPA is part of the Trump administration’s broad strategy to reduce civil rights enforcement by federal agencies. The office of civil rights within the Education Department is also targeted for cuts and a similar office in the Labor Department will be eliminated. Then there are the efforts to roll back Obama-era criminal justice reforms. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called for harsher sentences for low-level drug offenders - again a measure that will disproportionately affect racial minorities. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be charged and to receive longer sentences than whites for similar crimes regardless of prior criminal history or severity of the crime. Despite similar rates of drug use, blacks are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated for drug use compared to whites. Sessions has also signaled that his Justice Department will not enforce consent decree agreements that have played a key role in holding police departments accountable for civil rights abuses – another area in which minority communities have been disproportionately singled out. These policies are chipping away at the nation’s health and sustainability. The U.S. will be a minority-majority nation in a few decades. It is not in our national interest to marginalize Americans of color. (Reporting by Judy Lubin)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/lubin-healthcare-idUSL1N1JO1LN"},

The as-yet unbuilt Circuit of Wales, in a deprived area near Ebbw Vale, had sought the government guarantee for a loan facility of 210 million pounds ($268.76 million) from Aviva Investors. The 433 million pound project has a deal to host the British MotoGP round until 2020, with the option of five more years,  but has had to turn to Silverstone to keep the race on the calendar.

Trump,John Roberts,Matthew Douglas,Michael Bindas,US,USA,COURT,RELIGION,United States","sector":"News - Politics","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out a lower court's ruling prohibiting the use of public funds to pay for children to attend private religious schools, a day after it issued a major ruling narrowing the separation of church and state. The justices ordered Colorado's top court to reconsider the legality of school  voucher  programs in light of Monday's ruling that churches and other religious entities cannot be categorically denied public money even in states whose constitutions explicitly ban such funding. In that ruling, which could bolster the case for vouchers and other subsidies to religious schools, the justices sided with a Missouri church that objected to being denied access to public grant money for a playground improvement project because the state's constitution bans public funding of religious entities. The justices on Tuesday also threw out a lower court ruling in a similar case in New Mexico over a state program that lends textbooks to schools, both public and private including religious ones, asking that court also to reconsider following Monday's church ruling. There is a fierce debate in the United States over school vouchers, which many religious conservatives advocate and people against government funding for religious purposes oppose. Republican President Donald Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is a prominent supporter of such  school choice  plans. The Colorado case arose after the Douglas County School District, outside Denver, enacted a voucher program in 2011 to help pay the tuition costs of attending certain private schools, most of which were religiously affiliated. The district argued that introducing competition into education would improve public schools.  Individual taxpayers and a group called Taxpayers For Public Education, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, challenged the voucher program, arguing it violated a provision of the state constitution dating to the 19th century barring public funding for religious entities. Colorado's Supreme Court in 2015 struck down the county's program on that basis.  Religious Bias Alleged The school district, as well as Colorado's state government and voucher supporters, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The district argued that the prohibition on funding for religious entities at the heart of the controversy is a so-called Blaine amendment, written into Colorado's state constitution in 1876 as a form of anti-Catholic bias,  at a time when public institutions readily embraced Protestantism.   Throwing out the state court's ruling sends a strong signal that the high court  will not tolerate the use of Blaine amendments to exclude religious options from school choice programs,  said attorney Michael Bindas of the Institute for Justice conservative advocacy group, representing three families with children who had received vouchers. The district said the state constitution's ban runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of free exercise of religion and equal protection under the law.  The time to end this discrimination is now,  it added. The voucher program's challengers dispute that the state constitutional language was a Blaine amendment. They told the justices the program was a ploy to provide public funds to religious schools  cloaked as a federal constitutional right.  An attorney for the challengers, Matthew Douglas, said Monday's church ruling does not address religious uses of government funding. Douglas predicted that the Colorado court will again maintain its restriction on the program. In the New Mexico case, parents of public school children  in 2012 challenged a textbook lending program, saying it violated the state constitution's bar on public funding of religious or private schools. They said the program forced them to support the  religious dictates of others with whom they disagree.   The state Supreme Court in 2015 sided with the parents, prompting an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-religion-idUSL1N1JO0LI"},

The military arrested the journalists in Myanmar's northeastern Shan state on Monday after they covered a drug-burning event organized by the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), an ethnic armed group designated as an  unlawful association  by the Yangon authorities. The reporters are from two media outlets publishing both in Burmese and English, the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) and the Irrawaddy. They were among the few media organizations providing the world independent coverage of Myanmar when it was under military rule before a democratic transition began in 2011. The arrests alarmed Myanmar's media community, fuelling fears that freedom of speech has become increasingly restricted since the government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi took power in April last year.  Everyone should be treated according to the law,  Suu Kyi's spokesman, Zaw Htay, told Reuters. He added that the military told him it planned to charge the reporters under the Unlawful Association Act. A military source confirmed this. Citing information from the army, Zaw Htay said the three reporters and four other men arrested with them were  being treated very well  at a military guesthouse and would be handed over to the police  tomorrow or the day after tomorrow . Despite pressure from human rights bodies and the West, Suu Kyi's government has retained loosely worded security laws dating to British colonial rule, which ended in 1948, and decried by monitors as violating free speech. Suu Kyi has not spoken out against increasingly frequent arrests of reporters and activists. The Unlawful Association Act has long been used by the authorities to arbitrarily arrest and detain people in Myanmar, in particular people in ethnic and religious minority areas, according to human rights watchdog Amnesty International, which has called on the government to release the journalists. Western governments have also expressed their concern over the incident. The U.S. State Department said it was  deeply concerned  about arrests of Thein Zaw from The Irrawaddy, and Aye Nai and  Pyae Phone Naing from DVB, particularly in light of other recent arrests of journalists.  We urge immediate action on this matter consistent with international standards of human rights and freedom of the press,  a spokeswoman, Katina Adams, said.  A free press is vital to the success of peace and national reconciliation process,  she said. The editors from the publications where the reporters work told Reuters they had tried obtaining explanations from the military and the government, but to no avail.  We are all concerned about the situation, because we have lost connection with the detainees,  Than Win Htut, a DVB editor, told Reuters.  Their families have the right to know what happened to them.

(Reuters) - Arkansas installed a Ten Commandments monument on the state's Capitol grounds on Tuesday, and a civil liberties group pledged a court challenge, saying it showed an unconstitutional government preference for a certain religion. Legislators approved the act for the monument in 2015, and whether it was appropriate for the public grounds has been debated since. Similar monuments erected in Oklahoma and Alabama were ordered removed by courts. At the installation ceremony for the some 3,000-pound (1,360 kg) granite slab in Little Rock, state Senator Jason Rapert noted that the Ten Commandments were chiseled into the portals of the U.S. Supreme Court.  If it’s good enough for the U.S. Capitol, it’s good enough for the state of Arkansas,” said Rapert, an evangelist who sponsored the legislation permitting the new monument. But Rita Sklar, executive director of the Arkansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the group is preparing to file a lawsuit over the  monument's placement.  It’s a visible symbol of government endorsement of one particular religious belief over others, or over no belief,” Sklar said. Since Arkansas' Ten Commandments monument act was proposed about two years ago, Satanists and other groups have also sought state permission to place monuments on capitol grounds but were rejected. Rapert and other supporters of the monument noted that the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 had ruled in favor of a similar memorial on the Texas state capitol grounds. They said they were confident the Arkansas version would withstand a legal challenge. But Sklar said the Supreme Court had noted the Texas monument had been in place for decades, giving it historical value. In 2015, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ordered a Ten Commandments monument to be removed from capitol grounds there because the state's constitution bans the use of state property for the benefit of a religion.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she was sticking to the plan to raise interest rates gradually and that inflation has continued to run below the Fed's objectives.                  The U.S. dollar index        fell 1 percent and Wall Street dropped further, after a vote on healthcare legislation was delayed in the U.S. Senate, according to a Senate aide.                       Spot gold        rose 0.5 percent to $1,249.51 per ounce by 3:28 p.m. EDT (1928 GMT). It slumped to a six-week low of $1,236.46 on Monday.         U.S. gold futures         for August settled up 0.04 percent at $1,246.90.      Maybe gold was anticipating a much harder stance from Yellen and that's why we're rallying slightly rather than continuing the sell off,  said Phillip Streible, senior commodities broker for RJO Futures in Chicago.      The dollar's so weak, that also is lending some support on the gold market. Gold still likes that level of $1,250. That's the pivot point right there.      A huge sell order totaling 1.85 million ounces pushed gold to a six-week low on Monday, although the precious metal ultimately failed to break below the 200-day moving average.      If yesterday gold wasn't able to push below the 200-day moving average that's a positive sign,  said ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele.      The market is skeptical about Fed rate rises this year and next. Overall we're optimistic about the outlook for gold, we (see) a weaker dollar later in the year,  she added.       The dollar was already weak against the euro        after the European Central Bank president said he might begin to reduce the Bank's emergency economic stimulus.                  A weak dollar makes dollar-priced gold cheaper for non-U.S. investors.            Gold prices have gained every month this year save June, due partly to geopolitical tensions which most recently included Syrian hostilities, a bailout of Italian banks, the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump and Britain's negotiations to quit the European Union.      The gold market is seeing a bit of a bid right now. Growing tensions in the Middle East may be playing a part,  said INTL FCStone's Ed Meir in a note.      Among other precious metals, silver        rose 0.8 percent to $16.69 an ounce, while palladium        fell 0.6 percent to  $860 per ounce.

Murray, who is one of the most successful America's Cup veterans, has previously worked on winning campaigns with Team New Zealand, Switzerland's Alinghi and Oracle Team USA. But it was with his native New Zealand that he first won international sport's oldest trophy in 1995 on  Black Magic .  I don't really intend doing another one, but we'll see if I get bored and want to go again ... I'm sort of thinking this is my last,  Jones told Reuters on Tuesday at the New Zealand base in Bermuda, with the glittering silver trophy behind him. Jones, who competed in four Olympics for New Zealand, said an America's Cup campaign was  a massive time commitment  and he would have to decide if he was ready to make that. The 59-year-old, who was inducted into the  America's Cup Hall of Fame  in 2010, was  talked into  joining New Zealand's Bermuda campaign by skipper and sailing director Glenn Ashby only six or seven months before the cup started. This was a typically bold move by Ashby as Jones was part of the Oracle Team USA team which inflicted one of the most painful sporting defeats on New Zealand, overturning an 8-1 Kiwi lead and going on to win 9-8 in San Francisco in 2013. Reflecting on what had changed in the years since he first lifted the most coveted prize in sailing, Jones said the biggest transformation was in the type of boats and the  really  complex systems now involved in their electronics and hydraulics.  These type of boats really lend themselves for younger sailors who are really quick thinking ... which I think is a good thing for the cup,  he said of the 50-foot (15 metre) foiling catamaran in which Peter Burling on Monday became the youngest-ever America's Cup-winning helmsman at the age of just 26. And despite some of the acrimony which has surrounded previous America's Cup teams, with legal battles between their billionaire backers, Jones said the spirit is still of friendly competition between the sailors themselves.  One side wins and one side loses, but you are still going to have a drink together at the end,  Jones said, adding that the whole Oracle Team USA team had joined the Kiwis at their base after their final race on Monday. Jones put the victory down to a  very open minded  design and sailing team who were not afraid to  be bold  and stick to their own program rather than being distracted by others.  In the end we weren't that much faster than Oracle, but we had developed other systems on our boat that made it easier to race or do maneuvers that they couldn't and that was significant in the end,  Jones added.

(Reuters) - Arkansas installed a Ten Commandments monument on the state's Capitol grounds on Tuesday, and a civil liberties group pledged a court challenge, saying it showed an unconstitutional government preference for a certain religion. Legislators approved the act for the monument in 2015, and whether it was appropriate for the public grounds has been debated since. Similar monuments erected in Oklahoma and Alabama were ordered removed by courts. At the installation ceremony for the some 3,000-pound (1,360 kg) granite slab in Little Rock, state Senator Jason Rapert noted that the Ten Commandments were chiseled into the portals of the U.S. Supreme Court.  If it’s good enough for the U.S. Capitol, it’s good enough for the state of Arkansas,” said Rapert, an evangelist who sponsored the legislation permitting the new monument. But Rita Sklar, executive director of the Arkansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the group is preparing to file a lawsuit over the  monument's placement.  It’s a visible symbol of government endorsement of one particular religious belief over others, or over no belief,” Sklar said. Since Arkansas' Ten Commandments monument act was proposed about two years ago, Satanists and other groups have also sought state permission to place monuments on capitol grounds but were rejected.  Rapert and other supporters of the monument noted that the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 had ruled in favor of a similar memorial on the Texas state capitol grounds. They said they were confident the Arkansas version would withstand a legal challenge.   But Sklar said the Supreme Court had noted the Texas monument had been in place for decades, giving it historical value.   In 2015, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ordered a Ten Commandments monument to be removed from capitol grounds there because the state's constitution bans the use of state property for the benefit of a religion.      Reporting by Steve Barnes; Additional reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Leslie Adler","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-arkansas-commandments-idUSKBN19I2OO"},

Ramsey County District Court Chief Judge John Guthmann also ordered the state Senate to make rent and debt service payments for an office building and parking garage. Democratic Governor Mark Dayton touched off the legal battle with his line-item veto of funding for the Republican-controlled state legislature in the fiscal 2018-2019 biennial budget. Lawmakers sued Dayton earlier this month, claiming his May 30 veto of nearly $130 million for salaries, benefits and operating expenses was unconstitutional. The veto left $80.1 million of certificates of participation issued in 2014 for the office facility without an appropriation for rental and debt payments next due in November and December. It also led to a warning of a possible downgrade of Minnesota's AA-plus general obligation rating by S&P; Global Ratings if debt payments are not made. Fitch Ratings said Minnesota's AAA rating was not in jeopardy. Republican Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said he hoped the lawsuit will be fast-tracked to the state supreme court to receive a final ruling by Oct. 1. “This court order will temporarily prevent further damage to the state’s credit rating and allow the legislature to function temporarily while the courts determine the unconstitutionality of Governor Dayton’s actions,  he said in a statement Dayton and legislative leaders on Friday told the court they agreed to temporarily fund the legislature.

Trump,John Roberts,Matthew Douglas,Michael Bindas,US,USA,COURT,RELIGION,United States","sector":"News - Politics","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out a lower court's ruling prohibiting the use of public funds to pay for children to attend private religious schools, a day after it issued a major ruling narrowing the separation of church and state. The justices ordered Colorado's top court to reconsider the legality of school  voucher  programs in light of Monday's ruling that churches and other religious entities cannot be categorically denied public money even in states whose constitutions explicitly ban such funding. In that ruling, which could bolster the case for vouchers and other subsidies to religious schools, the justices sided with a Missouri church that objected to being denied access to public grant money for a playground improvement project because the state's constitution bans public funding of religious entities. The justices on Tuesday also threw out a lower court ruling in a similar case in New Mexico over a state program that lends textbooks to schools, both public and private including religious ones, asking that court also to reconsider following Monday's church ruling. There is a fierce debate in the United States over school vouchers, which many religious conservatives advocate and people against government funding for religious purposes oppose. Republican President Donald Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is a prominent supporter of such  school choice  plans. The Colorado case arose after the Douglas County School District, outside Denver, enacted a voucher program in 2011 to help pay the tuition costs of attending certain private schools, most of which were religiously affiliated. The district argued that introducing competition into education would improve public schools.  Individual taxpayers and a group called Taxpayers For Public Education, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, challenged the voucher program, arguing it violated a provision of the state constitution dating to the 19th century barring public funding for religious entities. Colorado's Supreme Court in 2015 struck down the county's program on that basis.  Religious Bias Alleged The school district, as well as Colorado's state government and voucher supporters, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The district argued that the prohibition on funding for religious entities at the heart of the controversy is a so-called Blaine amendment, written into Colorado's state constitution in 1876 as a form of anti-Catholic bias,  at a time when public institutions readily embraced Protestantism.   Throwing out the state court's ruling sends a strong signal that the high court  will not tolerate the use of Blaine amendments to exclude religious options from school choice programs,  said attorney Michael Bindas of the Institute for Justice conservative advocacy group, representing three families with children who had received vouchers. The district said the state constitution's ban runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of free exercise of religion and equal protection under the law.  The time to end this discrimination is now,  it added. The voucher program's challengers dispute that the state constitutional language was a Blaine amendment. They told the justices the program was a ploy to provide public funds to religious schools  cloaked as a federal constitutional right.  An attorney for the challengers, Matthew Douglas, said Monday's church ruling does not address religious uses of government funding. Douglas predicted that the Colorado court will again maintain its restriction on the program. In the New Mexico case, parents of public school children  in 2012 challenged a textbook lending program, saying it violated the state constitution's bar on public funding of religious or private schools. They said the program forced them to support the  religious dictates of others with whom they disagree.   The state Supreme Court in 2015 sided with the parents, prompting an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-religion-idUSKBN19I1RT"},

(Reuters) - The Delaware Supreme Court ruled in favor of Chicago Bridge & Iron Co on Tuesday in a $2 billion dispute with Westinghouse Electric Co that stems from cost overruns at a pair of unfinished U.S. nuclear power plants. Chicago Bridge shares soared after the court ended the battle over a 2015 deal in which Westinghouse, a unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp, bought the Shaw nuclear construction business of Chicago Bridge. Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse later sought an adjustment to the closing deal price by questioning Chicago Bridge's historical accounting, which Chicago Bridge said amounted to an attempt to recut the deal. Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge agreed that an independent auditor would review post-closing adjustments to the deal price, a process that is underway. Tuesday's ruling will prevent Westinghouse from bringing to the auditor issues tied to historical accounting, which made up the bulk of Westinghouse's claim for $2 billion as a post-closing adjustment.  CB&I; looks forward to quickly resolving any remaining disputes between the parties, which we believe should be immaterial in light of the court’s ruling,” said a statement from Chicago Bridge's Chief Executive Officer Philip Asherman. Westinghouse spokeswoman Sarah Cassella said the company was reviewing the ruling. Chicago Bridge shares rose as much as 38 percent after the news and were last up 36.2 percent at $19.61 - on track for their biggest one-day percentage gain ever. Trading volume also broke a record for the company and volume already exceeded six times its 10-day moving average about an hour before the markets close. The stock had tumbled 50.5 percent since May 8 as investors were anxious about the case as well as weak earnings. The news effectively took a $2 billion overhang off the company, which reported revenue of $2.4 billion for the first quarter of 2017.  The dispute is now only over an amount less than $70 million, and most importantly, is not able to be appealed,  said Daniel Scott of MKM Partners who estimated the amount from numbers filed by Westinghouse. Westinghouse bought Shaw for nothing up front, but agreed to accept liabilities related to nuclear plant projects that Shaw was building in partnership with Westinghouse in Georgia and South Carolina. Billions of dollars of cost overruns at those projects forced Westinghouse into bankruptcy in March, and have threatened Toshiba with financial ruin. Toshiba's U.S. shares fell 1.56 percent to $15.66 after the news. Westinghouse sought $2 billion from Chicago Bridge as a post-closing adjustment, contending that the infrastructure firm's historical accounting was not compliant with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Chicago Bridge had sought $428 million from Westinghouse as a post-closing adjustment. Chicago Bridge sued last year in Delaware's Court of Chancery seeking a declaration that GAAP compliance was not an issue for the independent auditor. The Court of Chancery ruled for Westinghouse, a decision the Supreme Court said on Tuesday opened the way for Westinghouse to make  a wide-ranging  challenge Chicago Bridge's accounting.  We conclude that the Court of Chancery erred in interpreting the purchase agreement this way,  the Supreme Court wrote.

The military arrested the journalists in Myanmar's northeastern Shan state on Monday after they covered a drug-burning event organized by the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), an ethnic armed group designated as an  unlawful association  by the Yangon authorities. The reporters are from two media outlets publishing both in Burmese and English, the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) and the Irrawaddy. They were among the few media organizations providing the world independent coverage of Myanmar when it was under military rule before a democratic transition began in 2011. The arrests alarmed Myanmar's media community, fuelling fears that freedom of speech has become increasingly restricted since the government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi took power in April last year.  Everyone should be treated according to the law,  Suu Kyi's spokesman, Zaw Htay, told Reuters. He added that the military told him it planned to charge the reporters under the Unlawful Association Act. A military source confirmed this. Citing information from the army, Zaw Htay said the three reporters and four other men arrested with them were  being treated very well  at a military guesthouse and would be handed over to the police  tomorrow or the day after tomorrow . Despite pressure from human rights bodies and the West, Suu Kyi's government has retained loosely worded security laws dating to British colonial rule, which ended in 1948, and decried by monitors as violating free speech. Suu Kyi has not spoken out against increasingly frequent arrests of reporters and activists. The Unlawful Association Act has long been used by the authorities to arbitrarily arrest and detain people in Myanmar, in particular people in ethnic and religious minority areas, according to human rights watchdog Amnesty International, which has called on the government to release the journalists. Western governments have also expressed their concern over the incident. The U.S. State Department said it was  deeply concerned  about arrests of Thein Zaw from The Irrawaddy, and Aye Nai and  Pyae Phone Naing from DVB, particularly in light of other recent arrests of journalists.  We urge immediate action on this matter consistent with international standards of human rights and freedom of the press,  a spokeswoman, Katina Adams, said.  A free press is vital to the success of peace and national reconciliation process,  she said. The editors from the publications where the reporters work told Reuters they had tried obtaining explanations from the military and the government, but to no avail.  We are all concerned about the situation, because we have lost connection with the detainees,  Than Win Htut, a DVB editor, told Reuters.  Their families have the right to know what happened to them.

The dollar weakened further and stocks fell after a planned U.S. Senate vote on a healthcare revamp bill was postponed, while Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said asset valuations are somewhat rich. The delay in the healthcare vote sent U.S. stocks to session lows as it brought back worries about the time table of President Donald Trump's business-friendly agenda. More time spent on healthcare pushes back the discussion on a tax reform eagerly eyed by investors. The euro hit a 10-month high versus the greenback at $1.1349 in afternoon trading in New York, but most of the move came earlier after Draghi, speaking to a conference in Portugal, said the ECB could adjust its policy tools as economic prospects improve in Europe.  Just the fact that the ECB is considering their options right now is considered to be a hawkish signal,  said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York. The dollar index fell 1.09 percent, with the euro up 1.5 percent to $1.1347. But the Japanese yen weakened 0.26 percent versus the greenback at 112.14 per dollar. Sterling was last trading at $1.2824, up 0.82 percent on the day. The dollar weakness helped boost crude futures prices, though the backdrop of a long-standing supply glut kept gains in check. U.S. crude rose 2.07 percent to $44.28 per barrel and Brent was last at $46.73, up 1.96 percent on the day. Tim Evans, Citi Futures' energy futures specialist, said in a note that oil's move was  a technical correction after the declines of the past five weeks  helped along by boosts from a weaker dollar and forecasts for a weekly draw in U.S. crude inventories. On Wall Street, bank stocks helped limit losses in technology shares, which extended after the healthcare vote delay. “The market likes certainty and now there’s uncertainty,  said Peter Costa, president at trading firm Empire Executions Inc.  What is this (health bill) going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration? That uncertainty I think is just having people pause a little bit.”  I also think that when the market gets to certain levels, any type of uncertainty, especially in anything that has to do with the (Trump) administration, will have an adverse effect.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40.35 points, or 0.19 percent, to 21,369.2, the S&P; 500 lost 12.1 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,426.97 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 78.15 points, or 1.25 percent, to 6,169.00. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.69 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.22 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.38 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.21 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.36 percent. U.S. Treasury yields rose in sympathy with European government debt weakness, after Draghi's comments. “He surprised the market with that upbeat stance,” said Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global in New York. “The European government bond market didn’t take it very well.” Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 18/32 in price to yield 2.1998 percent, from 2.137 percent late on Monday. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, with the spread between five-year notes and 30-year bonds dropping to a low of 92.5 basis points, the flattest level since late 2007. The spread between 2- and 10-year notes widened slightly to 82.5 basis points. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said it is appropriate to gradually raise rates and noted that the U.S. central bank is carefully watching inflation expectations. In corporate news, the EU slapped a record 2.42 billion euro fine on Alphabet's Google saying it had abused its dominant market position. Google said it was considering an appeal. Alphabet shares fell 2.4 percent. Gold prices, which tumbled to their lowest level in nearly six weeks on Monday, were supported by the softer dollar. Spot gold added 0.5 percent to $1,250.04 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.32 percent to $1,250.40 an ounce. Copper rose 0.90 percent to $5,846.50 a tonne.

Trump,Mitch McConnell,Peter Costa,Susan Collins,Dow 30,USA,HEALTHCARE/ (UPDATE 4,PIX,TV),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facing a potentially disastrous defeat by members of his own party, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decided on Tuesday to delay a vote on healthcare legislation in order to get more support from Republican senators. President Donald Trump summoned all 52 Republican senators to the White House on Tuesday afternoon to discuss how to proceed. McConnell had been pushing for a vote ahead of the July 4 recess that starts at the end of the week. The legislation would advance a repeal of major elements of Obamacare and replace it with a new federal healthcare program. The delay showed McConnell and Trump have failed so far to attract enough votes amid a solid block of Democratic opposition and attacks from both moderate and conservative Republican senators. McConnell, who has a razor-thin majority in the Senate, told reporters that Republican leaders were still working to get the 50 votes to pass the bill, adding that the White House was anxious to help write legislation that could pass the Senate. While the House of Representatives narrowly passed a measure last month to replace Obamacare, the Senate version stalled on Tuesday as a small but potentially crippling group of senators held out. Moderate senators worried that millions of people would lose their insurance. Conservatives said the bill does not do enough to erase Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic legislation. U.S. stock prices fell on Tuesday after the decision to postpone the vote. U.S. stocks have rallied this year on hopes for tax reform, deregulation and changes to the health sector. Markets are beginning to doubt whether the Trump administration can fulfill its promises. By early afternoon the benchmark S&P; 500 index was down 0.5 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average was off 0.2 percent. “The market likes certainty and now there’s uncertainty. What is this going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration?,  said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions Inc. The bill's prospects were not helped by an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Monday saying the measure would cause 22 million Americans to lose medical insurance over the next decade even as it reduced the federal deficit by $321 billion over the next decade. The report prompted Senator Susan Collins, a key moderate vote, to say she could not support moving forward on the bill as it stands. At least four conservative Republican senators said they were still opposed after the CBO analysis. Passing the measure would hand Trump a legislative win as he seeks to shift attention after weeks of questions over Russia's role in last year's U.S. presidential election. 'Root and Branch' McConnell has promised since 2010 that Republicans, who view Obamacare as a costly government intrusion, would destroy the law  root and branch  if they controlled Congress and the White House. Their electoral victories in 2014 and 2016 were directly tied to that promise, they say. Republicans worry that failure to deliver will tell voters that they are unable to govern effectively in the run-up to next year's congressional elections. If the Senate passes a bill, it will either have to be approved by the House, which passed its own version last month, or the two chambers would reconcile their differences in a conference committee. Otherwise, the House could pass a new version and bounce it back to the Senate. Democrats remained united in opposition, blasting the Senate bill as a tax break for the wealthy.

At a public hearing in Washington tied to the imminent trade talks, U.S. representatives Sander Levin and Bill Pascrell, both members of the House Ways and Means Committee, said improved labor rights in Mexico was their top NAFTA priority.       U.S. wages are being driven down by the depressed wages in Mexico,  Levin said in testimony.  Why? Because the entire Mexican labor system is designed to prevent workers from obtaining their rights and bargaining for better wages and working conditions.  Levin, citing a wage figure of about $2 an hour for Mexican auto plant workers versus about $28 for the United States, said that NAFTA must be modernized to ensure that Mexican workers have a true right to collective bargaining, replacing the current Mexican system of labor conciliation and arbitration boards. Negotiated in the early 1990s by the United States, Canada and Mexico, NAFTA lacks enforceable labor provisions. Levin and Pascrell said that new labor standards must have an enforcement mechanism that ensures full implementation of provisions before a new trade deal goes into effect. FILE PHOTO - U.S. Representative Sander Levin (D-MI) speaks the media after attending a closed meeting for members of Congress on the situation in Syria at the U.S. Capitol in Washington September 1, 2013.Joshua RobertsPascrell also sharply criticized the Trump administration for failing to spell out clear and specific objectives for the NAFTA renegotiations, which are due to start on Aug. 16.  We in Congress – and the American public and the companies and stakeholders that make up the American economy – are completely in the dark when it comes to what the administration intends to do, why, and for whose benefit.  Pascrell also called for  major reforms  to NAFTA's dispute resolution mechanism. Trump administration officials also have criticized the system, which it says is biased against U.S. interests.    The hearings, which also will include testimony from dozens of industry groups and companies on their hopes for the talks, will take place through Wednesday at the International Trade Commission in Washington. The U.S. Trade Representative's office, which will take the lead role in the negotiations, is expected to publish more detailed NAFTA negotiating objectives around mid-July.

Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday. A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other's consent. Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011. Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the negotiations, also said that Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. Such a deal would allow Sprint to invest more in its network, the newspaper added.

Anthony Murgio, 33, of Tampa, pleaded guilty on Jan. 9 to three conspiracy counts, including bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The sentence was roughly half as long as prosecutors had sought. Murgio and co-conspirators were accused of processing millions of dollars from 2013 to 2015 into the virtual currency bitcoin through the unlicensed exchange Coin.mx. Prosecutors said many transactions were conducted by victims of ransomware, a malicious software that locks up data unless people pay  ransom  to unlock it. Cyber criminals often demand ransom paid in bitcoin. The alleged schemes also involved the takeover of a since-liquidated New Jersey credit union to shield their activity.  Mr. Murgio led an effort based on ambition and greed,  and constructed on a  pyramid of lies,  U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said during the sentencing hearing. Murgio unsuccessfully fought back tears and lost his composure several times in expressing  enormous regret  for his crimes, which the judge credited as genuine.  I am wiser today than when the case began, and I am sorry for all the damage I caused to so many people,  Murgio said.  Believing what I was doing was OK did not make it OK.  Nathan cited Murgio's generosity to friends and support to his family in imposing a term below the 10 to 12-1/2 years recommended by prosecutors and federal guidelines. Murgio's lawyer Brian Klein said he was pleased with the reduction, after telling the judge that Murgio had taken responsibility for his  grievous decisionmaking.  In contrast, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eun Choi faulted Murgio's dealings with ransomware victims, saying:  He exploited their desperation to personally profit from them.  A hearing on restitution and forfeiture was set for Sept. 1. Murgio's father, Michael, pleaded guilty last October to an obstruction charge tied to the credit union. Nine people have been criminally charged following an investigation into the JPMorgan breach, which exposed more than 83 million accounts. Prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, who pleaded not guilty to U.S. charges after being extradited last June from Israel. In March, a jury in Manhattan convicted Florida software engineer Yuri Lebedev and New Jersey pastor Trevon Gross of scheming to conceal Coin.mx's activities from banks and regulators. They have yet to be sentenced. The case is U.S. v.

Ramsey County District Court Chief Judge John Guthmann also ordered the state Senate to make rent and debt service payments for an office building and parking garage. Democratic Governor Mark Dayton touched off the legal battle with his line-item veto of funding for the Republican-controlled state legislature in the fiscal 2018-2019 biennial budget. Lawmakers sued Dayton earlier this month, claiming his May 30 veto of nearly $130 million for salaries, benefits and operating expenses was unconstitutional. The veto left $80.1 million of certificates of participation issued in 2014 for the office facility without an appropriation for rental and debt payments next due in November and December. It also led to a warning of a possible downgrade of Minnesota's AA-plus general obligation rating by S&P; Global Ratings if debt payments are not made. Fitch Ratings said Minnesota's AAA rating was not in jeopardy. Republican Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said he hoped the lawsuit will be fast-tracked to the state supreme court to receive a final ruling by Oct. 1. “This court order will temporarily prevent further damage to the state’s credit rating and allow the legislature to function temporarily while the courts determine the unconstitutionality of Governor Dayton’s actions,  he said in a statement Dayton and legislative leaders on Friday told the court they agreed to temporarily fund the legislature.

Major indexes fell to session lows after U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell decided to put off a planned vote on a bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act until after the Senate's July 4 recess. The healthcare legislation, which has encountered resistance from several Republicans, is the first plank of Trump's domestic policy agenda, with investors eager for him to move onto his other plans including tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. Promises for such domestic polices helped fuel a 13.5 percent rise for the benchmark S&P; 500 since Trump's Nov 8 election. “The market likes certainty, and now there’s uncertainty,  said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions in New York.  What is this going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration? That uncertainty I think is just having people pause a little bit.   I also think that when the market gets to certain levels, any type of uncertainty, especially in anything that has to do with the administration, will have an adverse effect,  Costa said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33.16 points, or 0.15 percent, to 21,376.39, the S&P; 500 lost 9.69 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,429.38 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 65.14 points, or 1.04 percent, to 6,182.01. Big tech names weighed most heavily on the S&P; 500. Google parent Alphabet fell 1.8 percent after EU antitrust regulators hit the tech giant with a record $2.7 billion fine. The tech sector, which has led the market's gains this year, pulled back 1.1 percent. The healthcare sector weakened after news of the vote delay, and was off 0.5 percent. Financials were the best performing group, rising 0.9 percent. Data showed consumer confidence for June rose more than expected, which could bolster the Fed's case for another rate hike this year. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said the Fed rightly plans to raise rates once more this year, given recent inflation weakness is likely temporary. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she does not believe that there will be a run on the banking system at least as long as she lives. Investors are gearing up for second-quarter corporate earnings season, after a strong first quarter.  On an earnings basis, the market appears to be fully valued and we need to see fiscal policy, tax and regulatory reform, to drive GDP growth and then stock prices,  said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer of Bryn Mawr Trust in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

Draghi indicated that the central bank might tweak its stimulus so that it does not become more accommodative as the economy recovers.                  “He surprised the market with that upbeat stance,” said Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global in New York. “The European government bond market didn’t take it very well.”     Treasury yields rose in line with European bonds.                  Benchmark 10-year notes             dropped 18/32 in price to yield 2.20 percent, up from 2.14 percent late on Monday.     The Treasury yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                steepened after earlier falling to 92.70 basis points, the flattest level since late 2007.     The difference between yields on two-year and 10-year notes                also got as low as 76.80 basis points, its lowest level since Sept. 2.     The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve officials including New York Fed President William Dudley indicated that further monetary policy tightening was likely.     That has led short- and intermediate-dated debt, which is more sensitive to interest rate changes, to underperform while concerns about tepid growth and falling inflation have supported long bonds.     Longer-dated debt has also rallied as investors reach for higher yields.     “Funds are really defensive and believe that yields could really ratchet lower, and they’re putting money into duration,” said di Galoma.     Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday that it is  appropriate to gradually raise rates and noted that the U.S. central bank is carefully watching inflation expectations.                  The Fed may have to rethink its interest rate hike plans if inflation continues to wane, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said.                  The Treasury Department sold $34 billion in five-year notes to the weakest demand in four months on Tuesday. The ratio of bids to the amount of five-year notes offered              came in at 2.33, the lowest since February.                  The notes sold at a high yield of 1.828 percent, just above where it traded before the auction.                  The government will sell $28 billion in seven-year notes on Wednesday, the final sale of $88 billion in sales of new coupon-bearing supply this week.

At a public hearing in Washington tied to the imminent trade talks, U.S. representatives Sander Levin and Bill Pascrell, both members of the House Ways and Means Committee, said improved labor rights in Mexico was their top NAFTA priority.       U.S. wages are being driven down by the depressed wages in Mexico,  Levin said in testimony.  Why? Because the entire Mexican labor system is designed to prevent workers from obtaining their rights and bargaining for better wages and working conditions.  Levin, citing a wage figure of about $2 an hour for Mexican auto plant workers versus about $28 for the United States, said that NAFTA must be modernized to ensure that Mexican workers have a true right to collective bargaining, replacing the current Mexican system of labor conciliation and arbitration boards. Negotiated in the early 1990s by the United States, Canada and Mexico, NAFTA lacks enforceable labor provisions. Levin and Pascrell said that new labor standards must have an enforcement mechanism that ensures full implementation of provisions before a new trade deal goes into effect.

Sixty-two percent of U.S. respondents now approve of same-sex marriage, up from 57 percent when the Supreme Court legalized it in all 50 states two years ago and from 37 percent in 2007, according to the survey, which was released on Monday. The survey found rising support for same-sex marriage across affiliations with political parties, race and religion, with support strongest among younger Americans born after 1980 and Democrats. The survey of 2,504 people was conducted June 8 through 18. Republicans were split on whether they approved or opposed same-sex marriage, with 48 percent against and 47 percent for, within the study's 3.5 percentage point margin of error for the group. That is a major shift from the 73 percent opposition a decade ago. White evangelical Christians were the most opposed to same-sex marriage, with 35 percent approving it, but the support more than doubled from 14 percent a decade ago. Younger evangelicals were far more supportive, with 47 percent of those born since 1964 approving gay marriages, compared with 26 percent of their older counterparts.

(Reuters) - The Delaware Supreme Court ruled in favor of Chicago Bridge & Iron Co (CBI.N) on Tuesday in a $2 billion dispute with Westinghouse Electric Co that stems from cost overruns at a pair of unfinished U.S. nuclear power plants. Chicago Bridge shares soared after the court ended the battle over a 2015 deal in which Westinghouse, a unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp (6502.T), bought the Shaw nuclear construction business of Chicago Bridge. Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse later sought an adjustment to the closing deal price by questioning Chicago Bridge's historical accounting, which Chicago Bridge said amounted to an attempt to recut the deal. Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge agreed that an independent auditor would review post-closing adjustments to the deal price, a process that is underway. Tuesday's ruling will prevent Westinghouse from bringing to the auditor issues tied to historical accounting, which made up the bulk of Westinghouse's claim for $2 billion as a post-closing adjustment.  CB&I; looks forward to quickly resolving any remaining disputes between the parties, which we believe should be immaterial in light of the court’s ruling,” said a statement from Chicago Bridge's Chief Executive Officer Philip Asherman. Westinghouse spokeswoman Sarah Cassella said the company was reviewing the ruling.

Monsanto vowed to continue its legal fight against the designation, required under a state law known as Proposition 65, and called the decision  unwarranted on the basis of science and the law.   The listing is the latest legal setback for the seeds and chemicals company, which has faced increasing litigation over glyphosate since the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer said that it is  probably carcinogenic  in a controversial ruling in 2015.  Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the scientist leading the IARC’s review knew of fresh data showing no link between glyphosate and cancer. But he never mentioned it, and the agency did not take the information into account because it had yet to be published in a scientific journal. The IARC classed glyphosate as a “probable carcinogen,”  the only major health regulator to do so.  Dicamba, a weed killer designed for use with Monsanto's next generation of biotech crops, is under scrutiny in Arkansas after the state's plant board voted last week to ban the chemical.  OEHHA said the designation of glyphosate under Proposition 65 will proceed following an unsuccessful attempt by Monsanto to block the listing in trial court and after requests for stay were denied by a state appellate court and the California's Supreme Court.  Monsanto's appeal of the trial court's ruling is pending.  Monsanto Co's Roundup is shown for sale in Encinitas, California, U.S., June 26, 2017.Mike Blake This is not the final step in the process, and it has no bearing on the merits of the case. We will continue to aggressively challenge this improper decision,  Scott Partridge, Monsanto's vice president of global strategy, said.  Listing glyphosate as a known carcinogen under California's Proposition 65 would require companies selling the chemical in the state to add warning labels to packaging. Warnings would also be required if glyphosate is being sprayed at levels deemed unsafe by regulators.  Slideshow (5 Images)Users of the chemical include landscapers, golf courses, orchards, vineyards and farms.  Monsanto and other glyphosate producers would have roughly a year from the listing date to re-label products or remove them from store shelves if further legal challenges are lost.  Monsanto has not calculated the cost of any re-labeling effort and does not break out glyphosate sales data by state, Partridge said.  Environmental groups cheered OEHHA's move to list the chemical.   California's decision makes it the national leader in protecting people from cancer-causing pesticides,  said Nathan Donley, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.

(Reuters) - The Delaware Supreme Court ruled in favor of Chicago Bridge & Iron Co (CBI.N) on Tuesday in a $2 billion dispute with Westinghouse Electric Co that stems from cost overruns at a pair of unfinished U.S. nuclear power plants. Chicago Bridge shares soared after the court ended the battle over a 2015 deal in which Westinghouse, a unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp (6502.T), bought the Shaw nuclear construction business of Chicago Bridge. Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse later sought an adjustment to the closing deal price by questioning Chicago Bridge's historical accounting, which Chicago Bridge said amounted to an attempt to recut the deal. Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge agreed that an independent auditor would review post-closing adjustments to the deal price, a process that is underway. Tuesday's ruling will prevent Westinghouse from bringing to the auditor issues tied to historical accounting, which made up the bulk of Westinghouse's claim for $2 billion as a post-closing adjustment.  CB&I; looks forward to quickly resolving any remaining disputes between the parties, which we believe should be immaterial in light of the court’s ruling,” said a statement from Chicago Bridge's Chief Executive Officer Philip Asherman.

On Monday, the bank’s lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell filed a request for interlocutory appeal, arguing that the 2nd Circuit should consider two novel questions stirred up in a long-running class action by women who claim they were underpaid, unfairly evaluated and ultimately lost or left their jobs because Goldman treated women differently than men.  Goldman contends that U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres of Manhattan disregarded a U.S. Supreme Court directive in 2011’s Wal-Mart v. Dukes when she ruled that women who no longer work at Goldman can sue to change the bank’s employment procedures.  According to Goldman, the 9th and 11th Circuits have both said former employees don’t have standing to pursue injunctions against their ex-employers and trial courts within the 2nd Circuit have split on the question.  The bank also asked the 2nd Circuit to consider whether former employees who have not claimed they were fired can demand reinstatement. According to Goldman’s brief, none of the four women named in the class action – which seeks backpay, reinstatement and injunctive relief – has alleged she was wrongfully terminated. Two resigned. One lost her job after the 2008 financial crisis and another left when Goldman sold her entire unit. The bank said in its brief to the 2nd Circuit that, contrary to Judge Torres’ ruling in its case, five federal appellate circuits have held former employees “must have a valid claim for unlawful discharge to seek reinstatement.”  The 2nd Circuit rarely grants interlocutory, or mid-case, appeals but even Judge Torres, in a June 14 order certifying the standing and reinstatement issues Goldman raised, agreed that there is “substantial disagreement” and “conflicting authority” on the questions. Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein and Outten & Golden, which represent the women suing Goldman, opposed Judge Torres’ certification of the issues. According to Adam Klein of Outten, the plaintiffs also intend to ask the 2nd Circuit to deny Goldman’s request for review. “We do not think that the 2nd Circuit should review issues on a piecemeal basis,” he said in an email.  The Goldman gender discrimination case dates back to 2010, when former Goldman executives Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich filed a complaint alleging the bank denied them equal pay and promotions because of their gender. In 2012, after the Supreme Court’s Wal-Mart ruling, U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand, who was then overseeing the case, dismissed the women’s injunctive claims, holding that they didn’t have standing. In 2015, U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis recommended against certifying an injunction class, relying on Judge Sand’s 2012 decision.  Two new plaintiffs, Allison Gamba and Mary de Luis, then joined the case. Gamba worked for Goldman until 2014, when her business unit was sold. De Luis resigned in 2016 when Goldman denied her request for a transfer. Goldman moved to dismiss the new plaintiffs’ class claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under Judge Sand’s 2012 decision that former employees didn’t have standing.  Judge Torres denied the motion in her ruling last April, holding that Judge Sand’s 2012 decision was clearly erroneous. Torres agreed with several other trial judges in the 2nd Circuit that the Supreme Court’s discussion in Wal-Mart of the standing of former employees was non-binding dicta. She also said former employees have standing to seek a change in employment policies when they want to regain their old jobs. (I should point out that although Goldman argues none of the women claim to have been wrongfully fired, all of them assert they lost their jobs because Goldman’s allegedly discriminatory policies restricted their opportunities within the bank.)  The trial judge has not yet decided whether to certify injunctive or damages classes. She has called for briefing on the issue of money damages while Goldman pursues its interlocutory appeal.  Plaintiffs’ brief opposing the appeal is due in July. Class lawyer Klein declined to comment additionally.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-goldman-idUSKBN19I2N6"},

Sixty-two percent of U.S. respondents now approve of same-sex marriage, up from 57 percent when the Supreme Court legalized it in all 50 states two years ago and from 37 percent in 2007, according to the survey, which was released on Monday. The survey found rising support for same-sex marriage across affiliations with political parties, race and religion, with support strongest among younger Americans born after 1980 and Democrats. The survey of 2,504 people was conducted June 8 through 18. Republicans were split on whether they approved or opposed same-sex marriage, with 48 percent against and 47 percent for, within the study's 3.5 percentage point margin of error for the group. That is a major shift from the 73 percent opposition a decade ago. White evangelical Christians were the most opposed to same-sex marriage, with 35 percent approving it, but the support more than doubled from 14 percent a decade ago. Younger evangelicals were far more supportive, with 47 percent of those born since 1964 approving gay marriages, compared with 26 percent of their older counterparts.  The generational divide among white evangelicals is especially interesting, with nearly half of the younger folk approving of gay marriage,  said Nancy Ammerman, a professor of the sociology of religion at Boston University, who was not involved in the poll.  When their parents were that age, there was barely a visible white evangelical gay person to be found.

Female participation on high-speed catamarans has been curtailed by their physical demands and weight limits, but a change in the youth event helped Vose win her place on the team.  I feel incredibly proud to have achieved this ... and hopefully will have shown all the teams that it's an advantage to have a girl on board.

Vose, who is studying marine engineering at Southampton University, made her way through Land Rover BAR's selection process after winning four World Championships, one European and 10 national sailing titles. Although there are women in the support crews and shore teams in the main America's Cup which has just finished in Bermuda's Great Sound, sailing remains largely a male preserve.  This lack of women in the hunt for sailing's most prized trophy emphasizes the difficulty they face participating on the foiling catamarans, which are sailed with crews of six, and offer relatively few opportunities for sailors of either gender.

Anthony Murgio, 33, of Tampa, pleaded guilty on Jan. 9 to three conspiracy counts, including bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The sentence was roughly half as long as prosecutors had sought. Murgio and co-conspirators were accused of processing millions of dollars from 2013 to 2015 into the virtual currency bitcoin through the unlicensed exchange Coin.mx. Prosecutors said many transactions were conducted by victims of ransomware, a malicious software that locks up data unless people pay  ransom  to unlock it. Cybercriminals often demand ransom paid in bitcoin. The alleged schemes also involved the takeover of a since-liquidated New Jersey credit union to shield their activity.  Mr. Murgio led an effort based on ambition and greed,  and constructed on a  pyramid of lies,  U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said during the sentencing hearing. Murgio unsuccessfully fought back tears and lost his composure several times in expressing  enormous regret  for his crimes, which the judge credited as genuine.  I am wiser today than when the case began, and I am sorry for all the damage I caused to so many people,  Murgio said.  Believing what I was doing was OK did not make it OK.  Nathan cited Murgio's generosity to friends and support to his family in imposing a term below the 10 to 12-1/2 years recommended by prosecutors and federal guidelines. Murgio's lawyer Brian Klein said he was pleased with the reduction, after telling the judge that Murgio had taken responsibility for his  grievous decisionmaking.  In contrast, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eun Choi faulted Murgio's dealings with ransomware victims, saying:  He exploited their desperation to personally profit from them.  A hearing on restitution and forfeiture was set for Sept. 1. Murgio's father, Michael, pleaded guilty last October to an obstruction charge tied to the credit union. Nine people have been criminally charged following an investigation into the JPMorgan breach, which exposed more than 83 million accounts. Prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, who pleaded not guilty to U.S. charges after being extradited last June from Israel. In March, a jury in Manhattan convicted Florida software engineer Yuri Lebedev and New Jersey pastor Trevon Gross of scheming to conceal Coin.mx's activities from banks and regulators.

A Reuters survey of five major hotels found average occupancy was around 57 percent at the start of the Eid festival on Sunday which marks the end of the Ramadan fasting month when friends and families eat and pray together and take holidays.  We're usually packed with Saudis and Bahrainis but not this year,  a staff member at a five-star hotel said.  But Qatar's official news agency QNA cited officials and managers in the hotel sector reporting hotel occupancy over the holiday period stood at more than 95 percent and denied reports of lower rates.  They pointed to high tourist flows from the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Kuwait and a significant increase in demand from domestic tourism,  QNA said. QNA said an offer by some hotels to offer guests staying two nights at hotels a third night free had helped win high occupancy and that the sector has shown its ability to  diversify away from traditional markets . Aviation analyst Will Horton estimated Hamad International Airport, one of the Middle East's busiest, would handle 76 percent as many flights in early July compared with the same period last year, a loss of about 27,000 passengers a day.  The airport said in a statement on Tuesday it had experienced a  very busy  Eid period with 580,000 passengers passing through between June 19 and June 25. It did not give comparative figures for last year's Eid. Visitors from the rest of the Gulf Cooperation Council usually account for almost half of all visitors to Qatar. So a decision by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt to cut diplomatic and transport ties on June 5 hit traffic hard.     Doha in early July, assuming the restrictions remain, will have less capacity than a year ago - a confronting figure for a region where every month sets year-on-year records,  said Horton, senior analyst at Australia's CAPA Centre for Aviation.  FILE PHOTO: People walk past the Qatar Airways office in Manama, Bahrain, June 8, 2017.Hamad I Mohammed/File PhotoThere is no breakthrough in sight for the crisis in which the four Arab nations issued an ultimatum to Doha to close Al Jazeera television, curb ties with Iran, shut a Turkish base and pay reparations. A defiant Doha has denied accusations of supporting terrorism and says the demands are unrealistic. Air Travel Hit Hundreds of weekly flights to and from Qatar have already been canceled because of the dispute. Hamad airport stands to lose fees paid by airlines and passengers, as well as terminal revenue from duty free shops and restaurants. Air links suspended by the four Arab states represented around 25 percent of flights by state-owned Qatar Airways, one of the region's big three carriers. Qatar Airways, whose hub is Hamad airport, said on Tuesday that 510,949 of its passengers had traveled through the airport in the past seven days. It did not give comparative figures. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker had said on June 14 the majority of its operations had not been affected by restrictions imposed by the four Arab states. Elsewhere in the tourist sector, hotels, restaurants and other facilities have had to find new sources of services and goods, in some cases, at higher cost, due to the boycott, said Rashid Aboobacker, senior director at TRI Consulting in Dubai.  A substantial drop in visitor arrivals is likely to force hotel and real estate developers to re-evaluate their strategies and priorities, potentially causing delays to some of the ongoing (tourism) projects,” he said. Qatar’s World Cup organizing committee has said sanctions had not affected preparations for the tournament and alternative sources for construction materials had been secured. Qatar has said 46,000 rooms will be available to host fans by the time of the World Cup. In March, it had 119 hotels with 23,347 rooms, according to the tourism authority.     Developing business and leisure tourism is part of Qatar's drive to develop its economy away from reliance on oil and gas revenue. Doha aims to raise the tourism sector's contribution to GDP to 5.2 percent by 2030 from around 4.1 percent now, while raising the number of people employed by nearly 70 percent to 127,900.

The 26-year-old calmly steered his way into yachting history on Monday, demolishing Spithill's Oracle Team USA to win the trophy which is a national obsession in New Zealand and in the process become the youngest ever sailor to do so.  It was our goal and dream to come here and win the America's Cup and to have it sitting there and have it in the morning meeting when we all got together after a bit of recovery from last night, we're just blown away,  Burling told Reuters. Burling, an Olympic gold and silver medalist, was helmsman on Emirates Team New Zealand and the face of the crew during the campaign to wrest the  Auld Mug  from its U.S. holders. The celebrations following the win in the New Zealand team's  shed  where they have kept their space-age 50-foot catamaran and  wing  sail were  pretty low key , with the crew only realizing how drained they were once the adrenaline wore off.  We finally realized how tired we were and how most of us didn't really have that much energy to carry on,  Burling said on Tuesday at his headquarters in Bermuda's historic Dockyard. Burling said the losing U.S. team led by his  good friend  Spithill, who until the Kiwi victory had been the youngest ever helmsman to win the oldest trophy in international sport, had joined the New Zealanders in their celebration.

To be able to lift that and bring it home to New Zealand, it's going to be a pretty cool few weeks sharing it with all our fans and friends and family back home,  Burling said, adding he had received a lot of messages from supporters at home.  We definitely had a bit of a bumpy road at times, we faced a bit of adversity at times,  Burling said, adding that the spectacular capsize which nearly ended the Kiwi campaign during the semi-final did not haunt him  at all .  These boats are incredibly complicated and fast and incredibly technical. The harder you push it the more likely you are to have a crash,  the tall sailor, with his trademark reddish stubble, added.  We're really proud of what we have managed to achieve as a group,  Burling said, adding that his message to the next generation of America's Cup sailors was to get out and  have fun  as he and his team had done sailing their catamaran.

That sense of unity promises to be soon put to the test. The nine-justice court ended its 2016-2017 term on Monday with a flurry of rulings. When it resumes work in October, its recently restored conservative majority could become more assertive as the justices tackle big cases on whether the U.S. Constitution lets businesses refuse to serve gay couples for religious reasons, presidential powers and manipulating electoral district boundaries for partisan gain. Neil Gorsuch, Republican President Donald Trump's appointee, joined the court in April, giving conservatives a 5-4 majority. Gorsuch already has established himself as among the most conservative and outspoken justices even before beginning his first full term.   We will certainly see more cases where they are sharply divided,  Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Carolyn Shapiro said. While partisan tensions in Washington have deepened since Trump took office in January, the Supreme Court largely remained above the fray. In the 14 months that the court operated with only eight justices following Justice Antonin Scalia's death and was divided equally between liberals and conservative, it showed greater unanimity in its decisions than in recent years. During that time, the justices often sidestepped major rulings on divisive issues, resolving several cases narrowly and trying to avoid 4-4 votes that would leave legal questions unresolved.  The court even avoided a sharp ideological split in its decision on Monday on how to handle Trump's contentious order banning people from six Muslim majority countries from entering the United States. The four liberal justices were silent as the court allowed parts of the order to go into effect and agreed to decide the legality of the policy in its next term. The court already has agreed to hear several major cases in which the justices are likely to be divided on ideological lines, including one on the conflict between gay rights and religious freedom concerning a Christian baker from Colorado who refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple, citing his religious beliefs. Voting Districts The justices will also weigh whether state legislative districts violate constitutional protections if they are drawn purely to gain partisan advantage in a case involving a Republican-configured electoral map in Wisconsin that could have major consequences for U.S. elections. The travel ban case, Trump's first big Supreme Court battle, is a major test of presidential powers, with Trump's administration arguing that the judiciary should show deference to the president on national security matters. In the term that just ended, the court was able to decide all but two of the cases it heard. On Monday, the justices ordered that those cases, both on immigration-related issues, be re-argued in its next term, when Gorsuch would be able to participate. The action suggests the court was divided 4-4 along ideological grounds on those cases. A review of rulings from the 2016-2017 term compared with previous years shows a higher rate of unanimity, likely prompted by the greater need for compromise without a decisive ninth vote. In 69 cases in which the court issued decisions on the merits, there were no dissenting votes in 41 of them, or 59 percent, according to Kedar Bhatia, who compiles court statistics for the SCOTUSblog website. That compares with 44 percent in the court's previous term and 40 percent in the one prior to that.   With only eight members, I think the court was trying harder to achieve as much agreement as possible, both in the close cases and in the not-so-close ones,  said Kannon Shanmugam, a lawyer who regularly argues before the court. While they were shorthanded, the justices took up fewer cases that were likely to divide them ideologically. For example, they took six cases on patent protections, a higher-than-normal number, on an issue in which they usually are unanimous.

The court already has agreed to hear several major cases in which the justices are likely to be divided on ideological lines, including one on the conflict between gay rights and religious freedom concerning a Christian baker from Colorado who refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple, citing his religious beliefs. Voting Districts The justices will also weigh whether state legislative districts violate constitutional protections if they are drawn purely to gain partisan advantage in a case involving a Republican-configured electoral map in Wisconsin that could have major consequences for U.S. elections. The travel ban case, Trump's first big Supreme Court battle, is a major test of presidential powers, with Trump's administration arguing that the judiciary should show deference to the president on national security matters. In the term that just ended, the court was able to decide all but two of the cases it heard. On Monday, the justices ordered that those cases, both on immigration-related issues, be re-argued in its next term, when Gorsuch would be able to participate. The action suggests the court was divided 4-4 along ideological grounds on those cases. A review of rulings from the 2016-2017 term compared with previous years shows a higher rate of unanimity, likely prompted by the greater need for compromise without a decisive ninth vote. In 69 cases in which the court issued decisions on the merits, there were no dissenting votes in 41 of them, or 59 percent, according to Kedar Bhatia, who compiles court statistics for the SCOTUSblog website. That compares with 44 percent in the court's previous term and 40 percent in the one prior to that.  With only eight members, I think the court was trying harder to achieve as much agreement as possible, both in the close cases and in the not-so-close ones,  said Kannon Shanmugam, a lawyer who regularly argues before the court. While they were shorthanded, the justices took up fewer cases that were likely to divide them ideologically. For example, they took six cases on patent protections, a higher-than-normal number, on an issue in which they usually are unanimous.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-termcloser-idUSL1N1JO1DO"},

That sense of unity promises to be soon put to the test. The nine-justice court ended its 2016-2017 term on Monday with a flurry of rulings. When it resumes work in October, its recently restored conservative majority could become more assertive as the justices tackle big cases on whether the U.S. Constitution lets businesses refuse to serve gay couples for religious reasons, presidential powers and manipulating electoral district boundaries for partisan gain. Neil Gorsuch, Republican President Donald Trump's appointee, joined the court in April, giving conservatives a 5-4 majority. Gorsuch already has established himself as among the most conservative and outspoken justices even before beginning his first full term.   We will certainly see more cases where they are sharply divided,  Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Carolyn Shapiro said. While partisan tensions in Washington have deepened since Trump took office in January, the Supreme Court largely remained above the fray. In the 14 months that the court operated with only eight justices following Justice Antonin Scalia's death and was divided equally between liberals and conservative, it showed greater unanimity in its decisions than in recent years. During that time, the justices often sidestepped major rulings on divisive issues, resolving several cases narrowly and trying to avoid 4-4 votes that would leave legal questions unresolved.  The court even avoided a sharp ideological split in its decision on Monday on how to handle Trump's contentious order banning people from six Muslim majority countries from entering the United States. The four liberal justices were silent as the court allowed parts of the order to go into effect and agreed to decide the legality of the policy in its next term.

American Oversight, which has filed nearly a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration on a range of issues, filed the suit after it did not get an  adequate  response from two Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for communications between Icahn and representatives of his oil refining company CVR Energy Inc and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and senior agency officials.  Icahn, who owns an 82 percent stake in CVR, has recommended the White House change the biofuels program in a way that would reduce costs to CVR and other refining companies. He was named as an unpaid special adviser to President Donald Trump in December and has said his proposal is not self-dealing because it would benefit many refining companies, not just CVR.  We need to know what kind of influence Mr. Icahn has at the EPA to see if he has been shaping energy policy to benefit himself at the expense of American families,  said American Oversight Executive Director Austin Evers.   According to the court filing, accessing those documents  would shed light on a matter of significant public concern: the extent to which individuals associated with industry interests, such as fossil fuel firms, have access to the Trump administration and EPA and are influencing federal environmental protection regulations.  The group said that EPA Administrator Pruitt has a known track record of working closely with energy companies, raising the need for scrutinizing his communications with Icahn. Reuters reported in April that CVR made a huge bet in 2016 that prices for government biofuels credits would fall - just before Icahn started advising Trump on rules driving that market.  That gamble involved $186 million worth of biofuels credits the company said it needed at the end of 2016 to satisfy regulatory requirements. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, however,  said in May that it is not investigating Icahn's activity in the biofuels credits market.

Deborah Daniels, a former federal prosecutor who spent a significant portion of her career prosecuting child sexual offenders, made 70 recommendations in a report released on Tuesday and called for a sweeping cultural change within the sport.  The report indicates that at least there is an external perception that the primary focus of the organization is on winning  medals,  Daniels said during a conference call.  That wouldn't be surprising. It is the national governing body of the Olympic committee and the Olympic committee wants to win medals.   But what we are saying is there needs to be a clearer articulation that the culture is athlete safety first, not just success on the field of play.  That needs to start with the board and permeate through the entire organization.  Paul Parilla, chairman of the USA Gymnastics Board of Directors, said the organization will immediately move forward implementing policy changes recommended in Daniels’ report. The sport has been rocked recently by a string of sex abuse scandals, the most sensational involving Larry Nassar, once a team doctor for Olympians at USA Gymnastics. A judge last Friday ordered the former Michigan State University sports doctor be sent to trial on multiple charges of criminal sexual assault. Gymnasts say he sexually assaulted them under the guise of medical examinations over two decades when most of them were minors.  Among the report's recommendations were that adults affiliated with USA Gymnastics be prohibited from being alone with minor gymnasts at all times and they be prohibited from having out-of-program contact via email, text or social media. It was also recommended that all USA Gymnastics members must report suspected sexual misconduct immediately to the appropriate legal authorities and the U.S. Center for SafeSport. Daniels also pointed to a lack of oversight by USA Gymnastics when it came to monitoring member clubs and recommended the governing body use its leverage to enforce standards, including levying severe sanctions, particularly in the case of failure to report child abuse.  USA Gymnastics believed it had no real leverage over member clubs,  said Daniels, adding that it  would encourage them to take the steps that it wanted them to take, but it really it really didn't feel it could enforce those steps.  Daniels recommended the governing body make clear that individual membership in the organization can be at risk as well as club and club owner membership  meaning their ability to participate in USA Gymnastics sanctioned events if they didn't follow those rules.  Board of Directors chief Parilla apologized for any athletes that might have been harmed while participating in the sport.  An athlete’s well-being is our primary focus,” said Parilla. “Even one instance of child abuse is one too many.   USA Gymnastics is very sorry that anyone has been harmed during his or her gymnastics career, and we offer our deepest regrets to any athlete who suffered abuse or mistreatment while  participating in the sport.   Success in competition is important, but not at the expense of an athlete’s health and safety.  Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto.

American Oversight, which has filed nearly a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration on a range of issues, filed the suit after it did not get an  adequate  response from two Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for communications between Icahn and representatives of his oil refining company CVR Energy Inc and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and senior agency officials.  Icahn, who owns an 82 percent stake in CVR, has recommended the White House change the biofuels program in a way that would reduce costs to CVR and other refining companies. He was named as an unpaid special adviser to President Donald Trump in December and has said his proposal is not self-dealing because it would benefit many refining companies, not just CVR.  We need to know what kind of influence Mr. Icahn has at the EPA to see if he has been shaping energy policy to benefit himself at the expense of American families,  said American Oversight Executive Director Austin Evers.   According to the court filing, accessing those documents  would shed light on a matter of significant public concern: the extent to which individuals associated with industry interests, such as fossil fuel firms, have access to the Trump administration and EPA and are influencing federal environmental protection regulations.  The group said that EPA Administrator Pruitt has a known track record of working closely with energy companies, raising the need for scrutinizing his communications with Icahn. Reuters reported in April that CVR made a huge bet in 2016 that prices for government biofuels credits would fall - just before Icahn started advising Trump on rules driving that market.  That gamble involved $186 million worth of biofuels credits the company said it needed at the end of 2016 to satisfy regulatory requirements. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, however,  said in May that it is not investigating Icahn's activity in the biofuels credits market. American Oversight filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Murray and Soares, who also won in Stuttgart earlier this month, beat France's Julien Benneteau and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 6-2 6-3 to claim their sixth tour title together on Sunday. The pair, who won the Australian Open and the U.S. Open last year, are now looking ahead to Wimbledon, where they reached the quarter-finals in 2016.  It's big for us to win at Queen's, one of the strongest fields in the year... and it gives us great confidence ahead of Wimbledon,  Jamie, the elder brother of world number one singles player Andy Murray, told Reuters on Tuesday.  But on Monday (at Wimbledon) everyone starts from the same position... but we are one of the favorites for the tournament and we will do as well as we can.  The 31-year-old Murray said his relationship with Soares has grown over the past 18 months and the duo are looking to finish the season strongly.

Of course it helps that we have a good relationship as we spend all our days together.  We have been playing together for 18 months now and hope we keep playing together and finish the year as strong as we can.  Last year, Andy and Jamie became the first brothers to top the world rankings in singles and doubles at the same time. The pair have played together on tour and represented Britain at the Davis Cup but have never appeared together at a grand slam. With Judy Murray recently tipping her sons to  have a crack at Wimbledon  before the end of their careers, Jamie also refused to rule out the possibility of teaming up with his younger brother.  One day we might play together at Wimbledon but that depends on Andy's singles career,  Murray said.  I don't know when that might happen but at the moment I'm happy playing with Bruno.

Anthony Murgio, 33, of Tampa, pleaded guilty on Jan. 9 to three conspiracy counts, including bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The sentence was roughly half as long as prosecutors sought. Murgio and co-conspirators were accused of having processed millions of dollars from 2013 to 2015 into the virtual currency bitcoin through the unlicensed exchange Coin.mx. Prosecutors said many transactions were conducted by victims of ransomware, a malicious software that locks up data unless people pay  ransom  to unlock it. Cybercriminals often demand ransom paid in bitcoin. The alleged schemes also involved the takeover of a New Jersey credit union to shield their activity. The credit union was later liquidated.  Mr. Murgio led an effort based on ambition and greed,  and constructed on a  pyramid of lies,  U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said during the sentencing hearing. Nathan imposed a sentence shorter than the 10 to 12-1/2 years recommended by prosecutors and federal guidelines, citing Murgio's generosity to friends and support to his family. Murgio unsuccessfully fought back tears and lost his composure several times in expressing  enormous regret  for his crimes, which the judge credited as genuine.  I am wiser today than when the case began, and I am sorry for all the damage I caused to so many people,  Murgio said.  Believing what I was doing was okay did not make it okay.  Murgio's lawyer Brian Klein emphasized how his client had taken responsibility for his  grievous decisionmaking.  In contrast, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eun Choi pointed to the ransomware victims in seeking a stiffer sentence.  He exploited their desperation to personally profit from them,  she said. Murgio's father, Michael, pleaded guilty last October to an obstruction charge tied to the credit union. Anthony Murgio was one of nine people criminally charged following an investigation into the JPMorgan breach, which exposed more than 83 million accounts. Prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, who was extradited last June from Israel to face U.S. charges. He has pleaded not guilty. In March, a Manhattan jury convicted Florida software engineer Yuri Lebedev and New Jersey pastor Trevon Gross of scheming to help Coin.mx conceal its activities from banks and regulators. They have yet to be sentenced. The case is U.S. v. Murgio et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.

Democrats on a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee said that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety. A Republican draft package of 14 bills would allow NHTSA to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. It would also bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent NHTSA from preapproving self-driving car technologies.  We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines,   Representative Robert Latta said at a hearing of the subcommittee.  This isn't the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government make sure that industry can innovate.  Latta said he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July. General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc, Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said that under the Republican proposal, states would be barred from regulating self-driving car safety  without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in  to set binding rules.  We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority,  Pallone said. Democrats noted that the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, has not nominated a candidate to head NHTSA, which has a number of vacant senior positions. NHTSA did not sent an official to testify. Two automaker trade associations said in testimony it is essential they do not face a  patchwork  of self-driving state rules. They said NHTSA will have to approve exemptions. Republicans, citing competition from other countries and the rising number of traffic deaths, say it is urgent Congress approve sweeping legislation to ensure automakers and technology companies test the vehicles inside the United States.  The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars.

They discussed the Syria dossier and the necessity to work on a common response in case of a chemical attack,  Macron's office said in a statement.  It gave no further details. The U.S. had recently seen activity at Shayrat airfield, the same base targeted by a unilateral U.S. cruise missile strike on April 6, officials said.

French diplomats and defense officials said that there had been no specific information passed on to Paris on the new activity.   It seems to be a message to the Russians,  said one official.  That suits us and fits into Macron's red line on the use of chemical weapons.  The French presidency declined to comment.

Judy Huth has accused Cosby, 79, of giving her alcohol and then sexually abusing her around 1974 when she was 15 years old at the Los Angeles mansion famed for hedonistic parties. Cosby is already scheduled to face a separate civil trial in June 2018 in a lawsuit filed by Chloe Goins, a former model who has accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her at the mansion in 2008. Tuesday's court hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court took place less than two weeks after Cosby's criminal trial for sexual assault in Pennsylvania ended in a mistrial, when a jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict. Cosby, once known as  America's dad  for his beloved role as Heathcliff Huxtable in the 1980s television comedy  The Cosby Show,  has seen his reputation destroyed by sexual assault allegations from approximately 60 women. Only one accusation has led to criminal charges, and Pennsylvania prosecutors have said they will retry Cosby within months. Meanwhile, 10 women are pursuing either sexual assault or defamation lawsuits against Cosby, including Huth. Judge Craig Karlan on Tuesday set July 30, 2018, as the trial date for Huth's lawsuit. The case has been partially delayed by Cosby's criminal charges. He gave one deposition in Huth's case, but a second planned deposition has been put on hold until the criminal case is resolved. Last week, Cosby's spokesman said the entertainer was planning a series of free public seminars to educate young men about how to avoid false accusations of sexual assault. A lawyer for Cosby, Angela Agrusa, told reporters at the courthouse on Tuesday that there was a  lot of miscommunication  about what he planned to do.  He wants to perform again, to recapture his passion, which is to continue performing,  Agrusa said, but added that she did not expect Cosby to do so at this time. Huth's lawyer Gloria Allred, known for taking high-profile cases, said she would set up a parallel speaking tour in the same cities to discuss sexual assault if Cosby went ahead with the seminars.  I know that there are many, many accusers that are upset at the suggestions that there might be a town hall,  said Allred, who represents 33 Cosby accusers.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/people-cosby-idUSL1N1JO18H"},

Susan Mullane-USA TODAY SportsWilliams, who is engaged to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, confirmed in April that she was expecting a baby in the fall after posting on Snapchat, and then deleting, a picture of herself in a swimsuit with the caption  20 weeks.  She said she would take maternity leave through the remainder of 2017. Williams told Vanity Fair she found out she was pregnant about a week before winning her record 23rd Grand Slam tournament singles title at the Australian Open in January. She said she had felt off her game but thought her hormones were acting up. A friend suggested she take a pregnancy test and when it came back positive she  did a double take and my heart dropped. Like literally, it dropped.  She took five more home tests and later presented all six to Ohanian, who was as shocked as she was. She said her fiance now was earnestly preparing and already has a tip jar he puts money into whenever he uses profanity so he will not utter it around the baby. Williams gave no dates but said she expects to return to the circuit as soon as January, adding  I don't think my story is over yet.

The second-term Republican said he would ensure that the state continues to collect taxes, police will still patrol and state parks will remain open through the Independence Day holiday weekend. But he said he will allow courts and other state operations to close if he is unable to reach a deal with the Democratic-controlled state House of Representatives.  I'm making plans. I believe we are going to shut down Friday night,  LePage said in a weekly appearance on Maine's WVOM radio.  The future of Maine is worth shutting it down.  LePage said he and legislative leaders are $145 million apart in their negotiations over the budget, with Democrats seeking additional funding for schools while LePage is urging cuts elsewhere in the budget to offset spending. House Speaker Sara Gideon, a Democrat, during a Tuesday morning session called the possible shutdown  embarrassing and unconscionable.  In 1991 the state government shut down for several weeks as a result of a budget impasse, and lawmakers reached a deal only after crowds of furloughed state workers picketed the capitol in Augusta. The timing of the shutdown, before a long holiday weekend, could be particularly sensitive for a state economy that relies heavily on tourist spending.  Anything that's going to make it less likely that people are going to come in from out of state and spend dollars over the holiday weekend is going to hurt business,  said Mark Brewer, a professor of political science at the University of Maine. LePage has long had an adversarial relationship with state Democrats and threatened a shutdown in the last budget negotiations in 2015, calling the proposed budget a  Christmas tree adorned with piggy projects.  Maine avoided shutdown in that instance when lawmakers approved a $6.7 billion two-year budget over LePage's veto. LePage said that this time, a shutdown may be inevitable:  If there's a collision to be had, it's coming Friday night.

Judy Huth has accused Cosby, 79, of giving her alcohol and then sexually abusing her around 1974 when she was 15 years old at the Los Angeles mansion famed for hedonistic parties. Cosby is already scheduled to face a separate civil trial in June 2018 in a lawsuit filed by Chloe Goins, a former model who has accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her at the mansion in 2008. Tuesday's court hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court took place less than two weeks after Cosby's criminal trial for sexual assault in Pennsylvania ended in a mistrial, when a jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict. Cosby, once known as  America's dad  for his beloved role as Heathcliff Huxtable in the 1980s television comedy  The Cosby Show,  has seen his reputation destroyed by sexual assault allegations from approximately 60 women. Only one accusation has led to criminal charges, and Pennsylvania prosecutors have said they will retry Cosby within months. Meanwhile, 10 women are pursuing either sexual assault or defamation lawsuits against Cosby, including Huth. Judge Craig Karlan on Tuesday set July 30, 2018, as the trial date for Huth's lawsuit. The case has been partially delayed by Cosby's criminal charges. He gave one deposition in Huth's case, but a second planned deposition has been put on hold until the criminal case is resolved. Last week, Cosby's spokesman said the entertainer was planning a series of free public seminars to educate young men about how to avoid false accusations of sexual assault. A lawyer for Cosby, Angela Agrusa, told reporters at the courthouse on Tuesday that there was a  lot of miscommunication  about what he planned to do.  He wants to perform again, to recapture his passion, which is to continue performing,  Agrusa said, but added that she did not expect Cosby to do so at this time. Huth's lawyer Gloria Allred, known for taking high-profile cases, said she would set up a parallel speaking tour in the same cities to discuss sexual assault if Cosby went ahead with the seminars.  I know that there are many, many accusers that are upset at the suggestions that there might be a town hall,  said Allred, who represents 33 Cosby accusers.

Alder is among a clutch of drugmakers racing to develop a new, more effective migraine treatment by targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a protein involved in pain-signaling during migraine. Amgen Inc, which is developing its migraine drug in partnership with Novartis AG, submitted a U.S. marketing application in May for the treatment.   Eli Lilly Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd also reported positive late-stage trial data in the past two months. In Alder's trial, patients receiving a 300 mg quarterly dose of its drug, eptinezumab, through infusion, experienced a reduction of 4.3 days from baseline in monthly migraine attacks, while those on the 100 mg saw a reduction of 3.9 days.  This compared with the average 3.2-day reduction for patients on placebo. While the reduction in monthly migraine days looked  just ok , potentially consistent with an IV therapy, the placebo response was higher than for the other late-stage programs, Piper Jaffray analyst Charles Duncan said.      We think these results have been interpreted in a tough competitive context,  Duncan said. Alder's treatment is likely to be the last to file for approval but could still capture a sizable market share, mainly due to its less-frequent dosing schedule and multiple modes of administration, analysts and experts have said. While the approval of the IV is mostly derisked, Tuesday's trial data raises the question of what Alder will do with its self-administration plan as the higher 300 mg dose appears better than 100 mg, Leerink Partners analyst Paul Matteis said. The study data met the main goal, Alder said. Alder and its larger rivals are aiming at the about 36 million Americans who suffer migraines, which are characterized by recurrent episodes of moderate-to-severe headaches accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivities to light and sound.  The lack of effective medicines and the sheer number of patients guarantee that each company's drug, if approved, will eventually generate at least $1 billion in sales, analysts have forecast. Alder said it expects to complete enrollment later this year in another late-stage trial testing patients with chronic migraine.  The company's shares recouped some of their losses and were down 20.9 percent at $14.80 in afternoon trading on Tuesday.

Democrats on a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee said that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety. A Republican draft package of 14 bills would allow NHTSA to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. It would also bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent NHTSA from preapproving self-driving car technologies.  We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines,   Representative Robert Latta said at a hearing of the subcommittee.  This isn't the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government make sure that industry can innovate.  Latta said he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July. General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc, Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said that under the Republican proposal, states would be barred from regulating self-driving car safety  without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in  to set binding rules.  We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority,  Pallone said. Democrats noted that the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, has not nominated a candidate to head NHTSA, which has a number of vacant senior positions. NHTSA did not sent an official to testify. Two automaker trade associations said in testimony it is essential they do not face a  patchwork  of self-driving state rules. They said NHTSA will have to approve exemptions. Republicans, citing competition from other countries and the rising number of traffic deaths, say it is urgent Congress approve sweeping legislation to ensure automakers and technology companies test the vehicles inside the United States.  The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars.

Venezuelans have in recent years had to line up to buy bread or eat something else in the face of its soaring cost. The supply deal was agreed during a telephone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro on May 18, the trader added. Russia, one of the world's largest wheat exporters, harvested a record wheat crop in 2016 and carries huge stockpiles days before the start of the new season, with crop prospects for this year looking also good. The agreement was signed between a subsidiary of the United Grain Company and Venezuela's trading corporation CORPOVEX on June 19, the Russian company added. The first shipment is expected to arrive in Venezuela in August, it said. It did not disclose the size of the cargo. United Grain Company told Reuters the supplies were not humanitarian aid, but commercial deals reached with Venezuela. The statement did not disclose how payment would be made. Some 80 percent of Venezuela's bakeries say they have no available stocks of wheat, which is not grown in significant quantities in the country's tropical climate. They add government price controls prevent them from raising the price of fresh-baked loaves to compensate for rising flour costs. Four bakers in March were arrested on charges of illegally baking pastries such as brownies, which are not subject to price controls. The government of Maduro during the same month ordered inspectors to monitor some 800 bakeries in the capital Caracas, two of which were expropriated and put in the hands of local food distribution committees backed by the government.

Failure to secure peace deals and reintegrate rebels in Chad and Sudan has led to a  market for cross-border combatants  linking those two countries and Libya, said a report by the Small Arms Survey group. With desert regions already crisscrossed by Islamist militants, people smugglers and arms traffickers, there is a growing risk of destabilization unless long marginalized communities can be integrated, it says. The 179-page report largely focuses on the Teda, or Tebu, people inhabiting the Tibesti mountains in northern Chad that fringe the borders of Libya and Niger. They have played a central role in rebellions in all three countries. Their most recent insurrection in Chad ended in 2011, but the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi the same year drew them in, providing easy access to weapons.    This chaos attracts fighters - including armed opposition forces - from northern Chad and Darfur, and is already having repercussions in Chad and Sudan,  the report said.  The Chad–Sudan–Libya triangle has once again become the center of a regional system of conflicts. A notable consequence of these conflicts has been the re-emergence since 2011 of a regional market for cross-border combatants.   Since 2012, a series of gold rushes from Darfur in the east to Algeria in the west had further destabilized the region.  Fluid Military Alliances Chad and Sudan support opposing armed factions in Libya, where loose and shifting rival alliances have been battling for power since 2014, creating rival governments in Tripoli and the  east of sprawling Libya. Rebels from both countries have mostly aligned with their respective government's enemies.  Competing Libyan armed factions frequently accuse each other of deploying mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa.  A U.N.-backed government that arrived in the Libyan capital last year was meant to unify warring factions, but has largely failed to exert its authority. Some 1,500 Sudanese fighters may currently be in Libya, mostly deployed with forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar, said Jerome Tubiana, a co-author of the report. About 1,000 Chadians are based with anti-Haftar forces, and several hundred more are either trying to stay neutral or are willing to work for either said, he said. The report cited several examples of Chadian and Sudanese groups being stationed in the central desert region of Jufra, a recent flashpoint for fighting between pro-Haftar forces and their foes, and in Benghazi, where Haftar's forces have been waging a long campaign against Islamists and other opponents. The report argued that military-focused efforts to stabilize the region are unlikely to work, calling for socio-economic policies to integrate the Teda.    The Libyan crisis and the issue of a jihadist presence in the Sahara will not be resolved by a military intervention in southern Libya or by placing Western soldiers along porous and virtually non-existent borders,  it said.   The importance of the presence of the three states (Libya, Chad and Niger), not only militarily, but also in terms of providing services and development, cannot be underestimated.

However, the sector has come under pressure in the past few days over concerns about lofty valuations.  Tech has gotten a bit ahead of itself. We've seen the sector bounce back but I don't think you see the confidence that was there in tech prior to a couple of weeks ago,  said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial. At 13:11 p.m. ET (1711 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.24 points, or 0.1 percent, at 21,388.31, the S&P; 500 was down 6.8 points, or 0.27 percent, at 2,432.27. The Nasdaq Composite was down 51.48 points, or 0.82 percent, at 6,195.67. At a discussion in London, Yellen said it would be going too far to say there won't be another financial crisis but the economy was much safer now. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said on Tuesday the Fed rightly plans to raise rates once more this year, given recent inflation weakness is likely temporary.  I think at this point the Fed is more or less committed to raising rates as they're more worried about being behind the curve and reloading the gun in case of a recession,  added McMillan. Earlier in the day, data showed consumer confidence for June rose more-than-expected, which could bolster the Fed's case for another rate hike this year. However, a steep fall in oil prices and a flattening yield curve have added to concerns over inflation, which remains below the Fed's 2 percent target. The financial index was the top gainer with a 1.1 percent gains, with Bank of America up 2.9 percent and JPMorgan rising 1.6 percent. Sprint rose 4.9 percent after the fourth-largest U.S. wireless service provider was said to be in talks with Charter Communications and Comcast about a wireless partnership. Comcast and Charter were down about 0.70 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,487 to 1,352. On the Nasdaq, 1,523 issues fell and 1,276 advanced.

Alder is among a clutch of drugmakers racing to develop a new, more effective migraine treatment by targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a protein involved in pain-signaling during migraine. Amgen Inc, which is developing its migraine drug in partnership with Novartis AG, submitted a U.S. marketing application in May for the treatment.   Eli Lilly Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd also reported positive late-stage trial data in the past two months. In Alder's trial, patients receiving a 300 mg quarterly dose of its drug, eptinezumab, through infusion, experienced a reduction of 4.3 days from baseline in monthly migraine attacks, while those on the 100 mg saw a reduction of 3.9 days.  This compared with the average 3.2-day reduction for patients on placebo. While the reduction in monthly migraine days looked  just ok , potentially consistent with an IV therapy, the placebo response was higher than for the other late-stage programs, Piper Jaffray analyst Charles Duncan said.      We think these results have been interpreted in a tough competitive context,  Duncan said. Alder's treatment is likely to be the last to file for approval but could still capture a sizable market share, mainly due to its less-frequent dosing schedule and multiple modes of administration, analysts and experts have said. While the approval of the IV is mostly derisked, Tuesday's trial data raises the question of what Alder will do with its self-administration plan as the higher 300 mg dose appears better than 100 mg, Leerink Partners analyst Paul Matteis said. The study data met the main goal, Alder said. Alder and its larger rivals are aiming at the about 36 million Americans who suffer migraines, which are characterized by recurrent episodes of moderate-to-severe headaches accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivities to light and sound.  The lack of effective medicines and the sheer number of patients guarantee that each company's drug, if approved, will eventually generate at least $1 billion in sales, analysts have forecast. Alder said it expects to complete enrollment later this year in another late-stage trial testing patients with chronic migraine.  The company's shares recouped some of their losses and were down 20.9 percent at $14.80 in afternoon trading on Tuesday.

Two years into a devastating civil war between a Saudi-led coalition and Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, Yemen became a perfect breeding ground for the disease, which spreads by faeces getting into food or water and thrives in places with poor sanitation.  Soon after the outbreak began, the WHO saw a risk that it could affect 300,000 people within six months. But it spread at double that speed, prompting a far-reaching emergency response that may have turned the corner.   We have never seen something so explosive in Yemen,  Ahmed Zouiten, WHO's senior emergency adviser for Yemen, told Reuters.  We are really scaling up very aggressively our response and we hope that those results will start to show very rapidly.   Although most of Yemen's health infrastructure has broken down and healthworkers have not been paid for more than six months, the WHO is paying  incentives  to doctors, nurses, cleaners and paramedics to staff an emergency cholera network. With funding help from the World Bank, the WHO is setting up treatment centers with 50-60 beds each, overseen by shifts of about 14 staff working around the clock. The aim is to reach 5,000 beds in total.  FILE PHOTO: A woman helps her son as he lies on a bed at a cholera treatment center in Sanaa, Yemen June 6, 2017.Khaled AbdullahBut the bigger impact is being made by oral rehydration points with about 10 staff, whose job is to catch cholera cases before they become severe and need hospitalization. The WHO wants to have 2,800 such sites - 10 for every treatment center.  They are as close as possible to the people's dwellings, and we are able to get people who have just started to get diarrhea,  Zouiten said.  Slideshow (4 Images)The results are visible in the fatality rate, which show almost all governorates reporting daily deaths in single figures, or even zero.  The case fatality rate that is going down is a real thing,  he said. A map of the outbreak shows that the worst hit areas are largely controlled by the Houthi rebels. The worst cholera blackspots are Amanat al-Asimah, around the capital Sanaa, the port region of Hodeidah, and Hajjah governorate. Case numbers in the first two have fallen sharply in the past week, and although Hajjah repeatedly topped 1,000 new daily cases, Zouiten said many were old cases being newly counted.  Despite the war, trucks taking vast amounts of supplies to fight the epidemic have not encountered great difficulties in reaching areas in need.  So far, whenever we needed road permits, we've got (them), from both sides,  Zouiten said.  Normally an epidemic would be expected to recede as fast as it grew, but the WHO hopes that its aggressive response will stop the outbreak even faster than it erupted, helped by growing awareness in the community and the natural immunity of the many thousands of people who got sick and survived.

The FTSE 100 ended down 0.2 percent, erasing almost all the previous session's gains, with the pharma sector taking most points off the blue chip index. A profit warning by German's Schaeffler, which sent its shares spiralling down 12 percent, weighed on British car parts supplier GKN, which fell 4 percent, topping losers on the FTSE.  While we were braced for GKN to have a tougher second quarter after a strong first quarter, we suspect Schaeffler's mention of pricing pressure will still send a shiver down the spine of most observers,  Jefferies analysts said. They added, however, that they hesitated to make a direct read-across to GKN. Travel and leisure stocks were among the worst performers, with tour operator TUI down 2 percent after Barclays cut its target price on the stock. A downgrade to sell from Investec weighed on gambling company William Hill on the mid-caps as well. Strength among miners lent the FTSE a helping hand, pushing it slightly ahead of European peers. Anglo American, Rio Tinto, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton and Glencore were the top gainers. UK banks faltered but ended up 0.5 percent after the Bank of England tightened its controls on bank credit to more normal levels, deciding the risk had passed of a big hit to the economy after last year's Brexit vote. Jefferies said the BoE decision was expected and even though dividends would not be put at risks, the higher capital buffers reintroduced by the central bank could dampen expectations of excess capital being returned to investors. Updates from small-caps Debenhams and Carpetright provided further pieces of the puzzle as investors continued to seek clarity on the resilience of the UK consumer.  Both Debenhams and Carpetright are heavily dependent on the health of the UK consumer,  said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald.  With wage growth softening at the same time as inflation is beating expectations, there is a real wage growth squeeze on individuals.   Additionally, savings levels are low which means consumers have less slack to bear these reductions in purchasing power,  he added. Against this tense backdrop, there was relief as a positive trading update from Carpetright sent the carpet provider's shares up 10.4 percent. It had suffered a sharp fall in late April after nudging its profit forecast down, indicating consumers were cutting back on spending on larger-ticket items related to home renovation. Its shares scored their best day in five months, but their value had still eroded 25 percent from their levels prior to the forecast trimming. Debenhams, however, fell 2.2 percent to an eight-year low after it flagged a more volatile trading environment and said sales slid. Its 2017 profit could land towards the lower end of expectations if conditions did not improve, Chief Executive Sergio Bucher said. Marks & Spencer, which sells clothes and home items alongside food, fell 1.9 percent, weighed down by Debenhams. Shares in the world's biggest advertising agency WPP fell 0.8 percent after falling victim of a global cyber attack.

The accord, confirmed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts, will resolve a lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act by former employees of the respiratory therapy services provider on behalf of the U.S. government. Lincare, one of the largest U.S. providers of oxygen and respiratory therapy services and equipment, did not admit wrongdoing. Its settlement agreement was released late Monday after the deal received the U.S. Justice Department's approval.  Our clients are pleased the case has been settled and resolved and look forward to moving on with their lives and careers,  Daniel Oliverio, a lawyer for the former Lincare employees who pursued the case, said in a statement. Germany's Linde, which acquired Florida-based Lincare in 2012, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. According to the lawsuit, Lincare since 2003 billed government health programs, including Medicare, for oxygen equipment and tanks even when customers did not use or require them, fabricated customer oxygen orders and improperly waived customer co-payments and deductibles. The company also paid kickbacks to physicians and their families to refer patients by providing them oxygen and supplies for free, the lawsuit said. In court papers, Lincare said it followed various regulations and said the lawsuit was at most challenging  garden variety  billing errors. The case began as two separate lawsuits, one filed in 2009 by two former Lincare employees in New York state, SallyJo Robins and Kathleen Dunlap, and another in 2010 by Germano Lima and Roberto Rabassa, ex-employees in Massachusetts. Under the False Claims Act, whistleblowers can sue companies on the government's behalf to recover taxpayer money paid out based on fraudulent claims. If successful, whistleblowers receive a percentage of the recovery. While the U.S. Justice Department can intervene in such lawsuits, in this case it did not, leaving the ex-employees to pursue it. The department's approval was required to settle the case. Under the deal, the U.S. government will receive $9 million. Another $11 million will go to the former Lincare employees to cover their share, plus attorneys' fees and costs, according to the settlement agreement. The case is U.S. ex rel. Robins, et al, v.

The ruling by the Hague Appeals Court upheld a 2014 decision that Dutch peacekeepers should have known that the men seeking refuge at the base near Srebrenica would be murdered by Bosnian Serb troops if they were forced to leave -- as they were. The Dutch government resigned in 2002 after acknowledging its failure to protect the refugees, but it said then that the peacekeepers had been on 'mission impossible'. The defense ministry told Reuters on Tuesday that the state was studying the appeals court's findings carefully.  Our position has been, and will remain, that the Bosnian Serbs are responsible for this tragedy,  spokesman Klaas Meijer said. The case was highly unusual in that states participating in U.N. peacekeeping operations have rarely faced legal action because of their performance. The Srebrenica massacre was one of the most dramatic events of the 1992-95 Bosnian War. Altogether some 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed by Bosnian Serb troops under the command of former General Ratko Mladic at Srebrenica in July 1995, the worst mass killing on European soil since World War Two.  Many of the Muslim victims had fled to the U.N.-declared  safe zone  in Srebrenica only to find the outnumbered and lightly-armed Dutch troops there unable to defend them. They then headed to the nearby Dutch base.

Complex Ruling Reading the complex ruling, Presiding Judge Gepke Dulek-Schermers said that Dutch soldiers  knew or should have known that the men were not only being screened ... but were in real danger of being subjected to torture or execution.  FILE PHOTO: Muslim women cry near coffins of their relatives, who are newly identified victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, which are lined up for a joint burial in Potocari near Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina July 9, 2016.Dado RuvicThe ruling relates only to the 300 men who had sought safety on the Dutch-controlled base. Lenneke Sprik, an international security lecturer at Amsterdam's VU University said the ruling was  very important for future peacekeeping missions and the law on state responsibility.  She said the decision might deter countries from contributing peace-keeping troops to future missions. In a departure from the earlier ruling, the appeals court  said the Netherlands should pay only 30 percent of damages, as it estimated the odds at 70 percent that the victims would have been dragged from the base and killed regardless of what the Dutch soldiers did. The amount of damages is determined in a separate procedure unless the victims and the state can reach a settlement. The court rejected an appeal from relatives of other Srebrenica victims, who argued the Dutch government should be held responsible for the protection of thousands more Muslims who had gathered outside the base.  This is a great injustice,  said Munira Subasic of the 'Mothers of Srebrenica' group.  The Dutch state should take its responsibility for our victims because they could have kept them all safe on the Dutchbat (Dutch battalions') compound.

A new treaty could clear the way for closer ties in fields including financial services and power markets, but fear that any deal might upset Swiss voters under the country's system of direct democracy has put the project on hold. Without a new accord with its biggest trading partner, Switzerland would rely on a patchwork of more than 100 bilateral agreements that ease access to the EU single market. Many Swiss are happy with the status quo. But the government had made a treaty a legislative priority, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have said it was the price of any more trade deals. Swiss reluctance to follow through on an accord in the window before the EU's Brexit negotiations start in earnest threatens to put relations into a deep chill that could stall progress on unresolved trade issues. The eurosceptic Swiss People's Party (SVP), the country's largest, has opposed any treaty that lets the European Court of Justice (ECJ) settle disputes. The far right has thundered against  foreign judges  dictating to sovereign Switzerland, and conservative centrist parties have now essentially capitulated.  The government has concluded that in a referendum-based democracy this 'foreign judges' solution - having the European Court of Justice mediate in disputes - is not winnable at the moment,  Christian Democrats (CVP) leader Gerhard Pfister said. Pfister told Reuters his CVP colleague and Swiss President Doris Leuthard and even Juncker now agree that clinching a treaty by year's end is no longer realistic. A European Commission spokeswoman said:  We are making good progress since the meeting between President Juncker and President Leuthard in April and are confident that if efforts continue from both sides in that sense, the agreed timetable can be met.  Not Much at Stake? The CVP and pro-business Liberals (FDP) each have two seats in the seven-member cabinet, so an EU treaty is dead in the water without their backing. As their support faded, it undermined pro-Europe Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter, who this month announced his resignation and said a new cabinet player was needed to change the political dynamics on Europe. The flags of the European Union and Switzerland flutter in the wind in Blotzheim, France June 27, 2017.Arnd WiegmannStill, Pfister doubted a fresh minister could nudge Switzerland out of its  time out  on Europe policy, especially as Swiss business leaders are not lobbying hard for a treaty.  Of course it would help some politicians if business would fully support something but right from the beginning we were skeptical,  said Jan Atteslander, head of foreign economic ties at business lobby Economiesuisse. A treaty would not in itself expand business ties, but instead set out how Switzerland could fall under the aegis of EU institutions such as ECJ judgments or state aid rules in return for market access.  This poses a problem as the Swiss do not want to be subject to these things. We have been discussing this for over three years and are now in the 17th or 18th round of talks,  said a Swiss official familiar with the discussions. The parties now settle disputes though a joint commission, which under a treaty would do so after guidance from the ECJ. Slideshow (2 Images)Pfister suspected the EU was keen for a quick deal with Switzerland to  pacify the Swiss flank  while turning its main attention to thorny Brexit talks with Britain.  We will wait and see how the Brexit negotiations go and then perhaps adopt a position similar to the UK,  he added. Preventing Triumph for Far Right Pfister's remarks reflect many Swiss conservatives' thinking that the freedom of movement principle so dear to the EU - it allows the bloc's workers access to Swiss jobs, and nearly prompted a crisis last year over Switzerland's plans for immigration curbs - is bound to change over time. This may help Switzerland, which faces unease over immigration in a country whose population is already a quarter foreign but is keen to preserve its EU market access. One EU diplomat dismissed this as  wishful thinking , saying failure to lock in ties with the bloc now could come back to haunt the Swiss.  People in Brussels don't like cherry-pickers. If things start to pick up in EU then cherry-pickers will not be very popular,  he warned.    Swiss politics are driving the shifting mood. Other referendums looming on European issues such as limiting free movement should be settled before holding a vote on a treaty, Pfister said.  If you do it before (Swiss) elections in 2019 the risk is great that you would lose, and that would hand the SVP a triumph that we wouldn't want to have,  he said.

An accord would be the latest step in a long-running process to complete a state rescue of the world's oldest bank which is Italy's fourth biggest lender. It is also part of efforts to tackle Italian banks' problem loans, which totaled 350 billion euros at the end of last year.  One of the sources said the deal envisaged the sale of soured debts with a gross book value of 26 billion euros ($29 billion) for a total of around 5.5 billion euros - or an average price of 21 cents on the euro.  A few issues still needed to be ironed out, another source said. Monte dei Paschi has given itself until June 28 to reach an agreement on the bad loans, so a deal could be announced as early as Wednesday. Earlier this month, the European Commission gave a preliminary nod to a government bailout of Monte dei Paschi, but final approval is conditional on the bank closing the bad loan sale as part of a radical restructuring plan. Under the deal, Monte dei Paschi's bad loans will be repackaged as securities and sold in different tranches. The Atlante 2 fund - which is financed by mostly private Italian financial institutions - will buy the mezzanine and junior tranches for around 1.8 billion euros, the first source said. A senior tranche of just over 3 billion euros will be sold to institutional investors using a state guarantee, while around 500 million euros will stay with the bank, the same source said. Rome is under the spotlight for taking advantage of exceptions in EU rules designed to stop the use of taxpayer money to deal with bank crises.   On Sunday, the government passed an emergency decree to wind down two Veneto-based banks that will cost the state up to 17 billion euros, although officials say the government may end up squeezing a profit from the deal over time. In Monte dei Paschi's case, the bank will remain in business thanks to an injection of up to 6.6 billion euros in state money. Shareholders and junior bondholders will shoulder some of the losses.   Burdened by bad loans and a mismanagement scandal, Monte dei Paschi has been at the forefront of Italy's slow-brewing banking crisis. It emerged as Europe's weakest lender in stress tests last July.  The bank was forced to request state aid in December to help cover a capital shortfall of 8.8 billion euros after it failed to raise money from investors. Under the bailout, the government will take a stake of around 70 percent. Writing by Silvia Aloisi.

The lawsuit was filed late on Monday by Assured Guaranty Corp and MBIA Inc’s National Public Finance Guarantee, in federal court in San Juan. It is the latest wrangle over a debt workout many had considered a done deal as Puerto Rico battles a crisis marked by $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate. Assured and National, which insure a combined $2.3 billion of PREPA bonds, want a judge to rule the PREPA deal does not need the approval of a financial oversight board created under last year’s federal Puerto Rico rescue law, dubbed PROMESA. PREPA is not part of Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy, and the deal was negotiated largely before PROMESA was passed. “In spite of Congress’s clear intent to preserve the consensual PREPA restructuring, the oversight board has arbitrarily failed to issue the ministerial certification required,” said the 30-page complaint. A spokesman for the board, which is in charge of managing the island's finances, did not respond to a request for comment. Its delay in approving the deal, finalized in April, has irked creditors and sparked debate among lawmakers. U.S. Representative Rob Bishop told the board in a June 15 letter the delay was “troubling” and “outside the scope” of PROMESA. House Democrats Nydia Velazquez and Raul Grijalva disagreed, saying on June 16 the board had “clear authority” to assess the deal, and should reject it because it could increase electricity costs. While the board need not determine whether the deal fits guidelines for agreements forged under PROMESA, it still must decide whether to authorize the issuance of new debt, which could give the board an effective veto if it feels the deal could hurt Puerto Rico's economy. Under the agreement, which has been through multiple iterations since restructuring talks began nearly three years ago, PREPA creditors would accept 15 percent repayment cuts in exchange for new debt backed by a charge on customer bills. Insurers would pay a surety to shore up the new debt, and accept an additional $300 million in principal deferrals. National insures some $3.6 billion of total Puerto Rico bonds, while Assured wraps another $4.9 billion.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-prepa-idUSL1N1JO15S"},

The House Budget Committee canceled plans to send a budget resolution for fiscal 2018 to the floor this week, lawmakers said on Tuesday, as conservative Republicans pushed to add hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to the spending blueprint that would take effect Oct. 1. House and Senate passage of a budget resolution is vital to President Donald Trump's pledge to deliver on tax reform this year because the document would free Republicans to circumvent Democratic opposition in the Senate. But the push for cuts to programs including Medicaid and food stamps, which benefit the poor, threatens to engulf the debate in a Republican free-for-all that could end in a stalemate.  No budget, no tax reform,  said Representative Mark Walker, who chairs the Republican Study Committee, a group of more than 150 conservative lawmakers.  That's why there should be a sense of urgency to get this done pretty quick.  The drive to reduce spending could also make a tax overhaul harder to pass if cuts in programs for the poor appear in the same legislation as lower taxes for the wealthy, aides say. Top Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in Congress are working behind closed doors to agree on a tax proposal that can be unveiled as legislation in September. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a leading member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, is pushing to cut as much as $400 billion over a decade from a wide range of programs that benefit the poor. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said he wanted another $295 billion in cuts on top of that.  It has to be linked to tax reform, because we believe tax reform is going to happen,  Jordan said in an interview. The budget committee canceled its plans this week after the chairmen of several other panels pushed back against efforts to include $250 billion in spending cuts, a sum that some conservatives say is too low.  The end game is to get a budget out of the committee,  House Budget Committee Chairwoman Diane Black told reporters.  I do see a viable path. And I am going to continue to push.

The European Commission said the world's most popular internet search engine has 90 days to stop favoring its own shopping service or face a further penalty per day of up to 5 percent of Alphabet's average daily global turnover. The fine, equivalent to 3 percent of Alphabet's turnover, is the biggest regulatory setback for Google, which settled with U.S. enforcers in 2013 without a penalty after agreeing to change some of its search practices.

The company has also been accused of blocking rivals in online search advertising. The Commission found that Google, with a market share in searches of over 90 percent in most European countries, had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager holds a news conference at the EU Commission's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 27, 2017.Francois Lenoir What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation,  European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Google said its data showed people preferred links taking them directly to products they want and not to websites where they have to repeat their search. Slideshow (6 Images) We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission's decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,  Kent Walker, Google's general counsel, said in a statement. The action follows a seven-year investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals such as U.S. consumer review website Yelp (YELP.N), TripAdvisor (TRIP.O), UK price comparison site Foundem, News Corp (NWSA.O) and lobbying group FairSearch. The penalty payment for failure to comply would amount to around $12 million a day based on Alphabet's 2016 turnover of $90.3 billion. The Commission did not specify what changes Google had to make.  This decision is a game-changer. The Commission confirmed that consumers do not see what is most relevant for them on the world’s most used search engine but rather what is best for Google,  said Monique Goyens, director general of EU consumer group BEUC. Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, welcomed the Commission's findings and urged it to act on Google's Android mobile operating system following its 2013 complaint that Google restricted competition in software running on mobile devices.

By Taylor  Harris (Reuters) - Two U.S. studies on the effects of marijuana on drivers in states where it is allowed for recreational use came to different conclusions about whether it increases risks behind the wheel.    A study by the American Journal of Public Health published on Thursday looked at motor vehicle fatalities and found no significant increase in Colorado and Washington State, where recreational marijuana use is legal, compared with eight states where it is not legal that have similar populations, vehicle ownership, and traffic laws. Alabama, Kentucky and Texas were among the states in the comparison group.   “Our study focused on deaths and actually found what we expected going into this,  Jason Aydelotte, lead author of the study said in a telephone interview. Aydelotte is a trauma surgeon at Dell Seton Medical Center at the University of Texas at Austin.   Back in 2012 some argued that people would ride around in their cars crash and die. Our study proved that isn't true,  he said. The American Journal of Public Health examined data from 2009 to 2015 taken from the U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System.   In another study published on Wednesday, the Highway Loss Data Institute analyzed the frequency of car insurance collision claims in Washington, Colorado and Oregon, where recreational marijuana is also permitted.  It found a 3 percent increase in collision claims in those states compared with Wyoming, Idaho and Nevada, where it is not legal.  “In states that passed legislation approving the recreational use of marijuana, the data showed that there was a strong indicator that marijuana was a factor in considering the rise of claims,” Matt Moore, senior vice president of The Highway Loss Data Institute, said in a telephone interview. The Institute examined about 2.5 million insurance collision claims from January 2012 and October 2016.  Mason Tvert, communication director of the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-legalization group, questioned the methodology of the Institute's study.   “There’s no clear evidence that marijuana is a factor. It’s going to take several years and studies before we can determine that,” he said in a telephone interview.  The Institute's Moore defended its approach, saying,  We looked at the correlation of states with similar insurance claim frequencies, and the states we chose had the highest correlation.”  Federal law prohibits recreational use of marijuana in the country, however, it has been approved by eight states including  Maine, Massachusetts, Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, Nevada and the District of Columbia.

I am confident that with the political will to put jobs and prosperity first we can achieve an early agreement on a transitional period,  Hammond said at an economic summit of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in Berlin. Hammond's political career came back from the brink after Prime Minister Theresa May lost her governing majority in the June 8 election, leaving her unable to carry out a reshuffle of her top team in which he was seen as the biggest likely casualty for appearing to favour a  soft  Brexit. British business views Hammond as one of the senior ministers keenest on preserving trade ties with the EU and less focused on curbing immigration, and in his speech he stressed how much firms in Britain and Germany relied on each other. But he also said there was a serious risk  that somehow we allow petty politics to interfere with economic logic, and we end up with a suboptimal solution that fails to maximise our mutual benefit.  However for many Europeans, the EU is a political project as much as an economic one, and free trade is only permissible alongside free movement of people - or uncontrolled immigration, from the British government's perspective. Hammond sought to smooth over these concerns, saying Britain wanted to  manage  rather than  shut down  flows of migrants from the EU, and that EU countries had  reasonable concerns  about issues such as financial regulation after Brexit.  Hard  Brexiteers want sweeping cuts in annual immigration and a complete break of Britain from EU structures. Hammond also poked fun at Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, whom many European politicians derided for saying Britain should be able to dodge painful tradeoffs when leaving the EU and be  pro-cake  as well as  pro-eating it . Britain's Sunday Times newspaper said this week that some ministers see Hammond as a potential caretaker prime minister to lead Britain through Brexit if May is forced to step down. In a sign of a change in tone since May's election debacle, the government will set up a new Brexit advisory group bringing together business leaders and top ministers to ensure major firms' views are taken into account in the process. But it stops short of the regular access some business leaders enjoyed with May's predecessor, David Cameron, who favoured remaining in the EU but resigned a year ago after Britons voted narrowly in favour of leaving. A spokeswoman for May said the government wanted business to avoid a  cliff edge  when Britain leaves the EU.

Manager John Farrell said there was  no panic  in Lin's at-bats. 1B Mitch Moreland took over the club home run lead with his 12th, a solo shot in the first inning, and added a sacrifice fly in the seventh to take over the team RBI lead with 41.  He's become kind of a bedrock in our lineup,  said manager John Farrell.  His all-field approach, particularly in this ballpark, works well. It's almost like an even distribution where his base hits come from, so ... the plate coverage is there. In this most-recent stretch, he's been able to get on top of some fastballs that have been either at the top of the strike zone or above for some power.

It was his first career save chance against the Twins and he now has a save against every major league team. Right-handed hitters are 2-for-63 against him this season. LHP Chris Sale worked 6 1/3 innings and picked up his 10th win in a 4-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins Monday night. He is 9-1 since April 27 and has a major league-leading 14 quality starts among his 16. He leads the majors with 155 strikeouts. Asked after the game if he wanted to come out with first and second and one out in a 2-1 game in the seventh, he said,  Never.  Said manager John Farrell:  We're talking about an elite guy in the major leagues. It's a treat for us to see him pitch every fifth or sixth day.  LHP Drew Pomeranz faces the Twins in the second game of the four-game series Tuesday night. He hasn't won in his last three starts (one loss) but pitched to a 3.00 ERA over his last seven, striking out 43 and walking 11 in 39 innings over that span. He is 1-1 in two lifetime appearances against the Twins, one as a starter and both coming for Oakland in 2015. LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (right knee) went through pre-game fielding drills and is on target to make a Thursday night rehab start. 3B Jhonny Peralta, signed to a minor league contract, reported to Triple-A Pawtucket and will make his debut Tuesday night.

Asked if Lovullo could be activated for the St. Louis series Tuesday-Thursday, Lovullo said:  I don't want to go that far. We want him as goon as he is ready to perform at 100 percent.  Pollock has been out since May 15. 1B Paul Goldschmidt was given his first day off of the season Monday, the third time he has not started this season after playing all previous 76 games. The D-backs are in a stretch of 16 games in 17 days that includes consecutive three-game series against St. Louis and fellow NL West contenders Colorado and the Dodgers beginning Tuesday.  I felt it made a lot of sense to get him off his feet and give him a good push for some important series that are coming up,  manager Torey Lovullo said. Goldschmidt entered the day with a major league-high 65 RBIs, three more than teammate and No. 2 3B Jake Lamb.

C Chris Herrmann was 1-for-3 with a homer in the first inning and two walks while making his first career start in the leadoff position leading. He hit the sixth pitch he saw for his career-high seventh homer.  To hit a home run my first leadoff appearance, that's pretty sweet,  said reserve Herrmann, who has played left field and catcher this season.  I know you are supposed to see a lot of pitches, so I did that part. I got a good pitch to hit. It was pretty cool. Probably one of my favorite home runs I've ever hit, because I'm not a leadoff hitter.  CF Gregor Blanco was given a day off.

Mayers was 5-6 with a 3.74 ERA in 14 starts for Memphis, decent numbers in the hitter-friendly PCL. 1B Luke Voit made his first big league start Monday, batting sixth and going 1-for-4 with a double. Voit, who was tied for the Pacific Coast League lead with 23 doubles and also ranked fourth in OPS at .967 for Triple-A Memphis, debuted Sunday night as a pinch-hitter and was hit by a pitch in the seventh inning. The debut had special meaning for Voit, a St. Louis native who went to the same high school as former NL MVP Ryan Howard. 1B Matt Carpenter got a rare day off Monday, representing just the eighth time in 75 games that he hasn't started. Carpenter is in a 3-for-26 skid that's dropped his average to .236, and with LHP Brandon Finnegan going for Cincinnati, manager Mike Matheny opted to give Carpenter a maintenance day. Carpenter should be back in the lineup Tuesday night at Arizona. RHP Michael Wacha authored his best start in more than a month, working six solid innings and earning his fourth win of the year. Wacha allowed five hits and a run, walking one and whiffing five in an 88-pitch outing. The biggest difference between this one and recent games -- he failed to last past four innings in five of the last two starts -- is that Wacha maintained his mid-90s velocity and didn't have a sudden mid-game dip. RHP Carlos Martinez gets the start Tuesday night when St. Louis opens a three-game series in Arizona. Martinez pitched decently in a 5-1 loss Thursday at Philadelphia, but a pair of solo homers and an unearned run were too much to overcome in his six innings of work.

The Phillies have said Eickhoff could return to the rotation Wednesday, but nothing has been set.  It's just a matter of how I feel today,  he said. Eickhoff is 0-7 with a 4.93 ERA in 14 starts this season. CF Odubel Herrera has 13 doubles in June, one short of the franchise record for doubles in June in the modern era (since 1900).

Gallo's 20 homers are the most in the first half of the season by a Rangers player since Nelson Cruz (22) and Adrian Beltre (21) in 2013. Thirty-one of Gallo?s last 42 hits have been for extra bases. LHP Cole Hamels had a rough return to the rotation. In his first start since April 26, Hamels lasted just 4 1/3 innings, giving up seven runs on eight hits, with one strikeout and four walks. Hamels had been on the disabled list since April 26 with a right oblique strain, and Manager Jeff Banister attributed his ugly start Monday to inactivity.   First game back, he lacked command and didn't throw many first pitch strikes,  Banister said.  Most of the hits he gave up were in the middle of the plate, and he only got one out vs. a left-handed hitter, which is uncharacteristic for him.  3B Adrian Beltre's three-run home run in the first inning was the 449th of his career, tying him with Jeff Bagwell and Vladimir Guerrero for 39th on the all-time list.

Draghi on Tuesday opened the door to tweaks in the bank's aggressive stimulus policy, fuelling market expectations the bank will announce a reduction of stimulus as soon as September. Utilities, whose constant dividends flows become less attractive when monetary policy tightens, fell 2.4 percent, suffering their biggest one day loss since November. Shares in Spanish power network operator Red Electrica , Italian gas firm Italgas and German heavyweight utility E.ON were among the top losers in Europe with losses of more than 3 percent. Their losses helped drag the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.8 percent. However shares in banks, which have long suffered from the ECB's ultra loose policy, were boosted by Draghi's remarks with the euro zone sectoral index ending up 1.4 percent.  Today Draghi moved his first step towards indicating that ECB monetary policy will become less accommodative in 2018,  said UniCredit chief euro zone economist Marco Valli.  Unless an unexpected shock materialises, a formal tapering announcement is likely to come at the ECB monetary policy meeting scheduled on 7 September,  he added. Shares in banks such as Caixa, Deutsche Bank , Sabadell and Bankia - which are more sensitive than others  to the rate cycle - were among the top five euro zone bank gainers, all up over 2.4 percent. Bankia got an extra boost as investors cheered to its deal to buy smaller peer BMN in a $924 million deal. A weak spot among banks was Italy's Carige which fell 3.4 percent to a fresh record low on mounting talk the troubled Genoa-based lender will need more capital than the 450 million euro initially planned to repair its finances. Autos fell 1.5 percent after German auto parts supplier Schaeffler slashed its profit guidance on growing price pressures and high costs. Schaeffler shares tumbled 12.8 percent.  Schaeffler flagging increased pricing pressure will almost definitely raise concerns across the supplier space,  Jefferies said in a note.  Schaeffler's profit warning will reignite the debate on the resilience on supplier margins and organic growth (post pricing) as we approach the 'peak' of the cycle.  German drugmaker Stada dropped 3 percent after Bain Capital and Cinven failed to win the required shareholder acceptances to take over the firm. Stada, which have rallied nearly 26 percent this year, however came off earlier lows after Reuters reported that the private equity groups were discussing a new offer. A.P. Moller-Maersk the world's biggest advertising agency WPP fell 0.5 and 0.8 percent respectively after falling victim of a global cyber attack. Gains among mining firms Anglo American, ArcelorMittal and Rio Tinto helped prop up the basic resources sector.

I'm concerned that Russia may backfill North Korea,  Haley told U.S. lawmakers in Washington.  We don't have proof of that, but we are watching that carefully.  While Washington has urged countries to downgrade ties with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, a cross-border ferry service was launched in May between North Korea and neighboring Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the world should talk to, rather than threaten, North Korea.  We just need to keep the pressure on China, we need to keep our eyes on Russia, and we need to continue to let the North Korea regime know we are not looking for regime change ... we just want them to stop the nuclear activity,  Haley said. The U.N. Security Council first imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear tests and two long-range missile launches. The government in Pyongyang is threatening a sixth nuclear test. The Trump administration has been pressing China aggressively to rein in its reclusive neighbor, warning that all options are on the table if Pyongyang persists with its nuclear and missile development programs.  Beijing has repeatedly said its influence on North Korea is limited and that it is doing all it can, but U.S. President Donald Trump last week said China's efforts had failed. The United States has struggled to slow North Korea's programs, which have become a security priority given Pyongyang's vow to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.  The pressure on China can't stop,  Haley said.  We have to have China doing what they're supposed to. At the same time all other countries need to make sure they're enforcing the sanctions that the Security Council has already put in place.  Trump, increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues, is now considering possible trade actions against Beijing, senior administration officials told Reuters. The United States also plans to place China on its global list of worst offenders in human trafficking and forced labor, sources said, a step that could aggravate tensions with Beijing.

It is the biggest fine the European Commission has ever imposed on a single company in an antitrust case, exceeding a 1.06-billion-euro sanction handed down against U.S. chipmaker Intel in 2009 and goes far beyond what U.S. regulators have ever fined a tech company. European Union competition chief Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday gave Google 90 days to stop favouring its own shopping service in internet searches or face a further daily penalty of up to 5 percent of parent company Alphabet's average daily global revenue.  Google's strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn't just about attracting customers. It wasn't just about making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google has abused its market dominance as a search engine,  she told a news conference. The fine will be easy for the world's biggest search engine to absorb, but Google must now move fast to satisfy Vestager's concerns while limiting the longer-term hit to its highly lucractive search business. It also leaves other tech companies wondering how far Vestager may go to force U.S. tech giants to concede more ground to smaller competitors. Vestager has become one of the world’s most combative antitrust regulators with powers to impose multi-billion dollar fines and force companies to make radical changes to their businesses. Last year, the former Danish economy minister ordered Apple to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of 13 billion euros as it ruled the company had received illegal state aid. Apple is appealing the decision. The decision is the first of a series of competition rulings that Google faces from the European Commission, which has not shrunk from taking on U.S. tech giants such as Alphabet, which has annual revenues of $90 billion and a market value of $665 billion. The Commission has also charged Google with using its Android mobile operating system to crush rivals, a case that could potentially be the most damaging for the company, as it is the system used in most smartphones. The company has also been accused of blocking rivals in online search advertising. Rivals Demoted The Commission found that Google, with a market share in searches of over 90 percent in most European countries, had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results. Vestager said in a statement that Google had  denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.  Google said its data showed people preferred links taking them directly to products they want and not to websites where they have to repeat their search.  We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission's decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,  Kent Walker, Google's general counsel, said in a statement. Alphabet, whose shares were down about 1 percent, said in a separate statement it would review the Commission's formal decision but expected to accrue the fine in the second quarter. The biggest risk to Google is not the fine but the changes demanded to its business, said Richard Windsor, an independent financial analyst who tracks competition among the biggest U.S. and Asian internet and mobile companies. Google will have to brief the Commission on what measures it plans to take within 60 days of the decision and present periodic reports. Eight complainants were involved in the case which the EU declined to name in line with its policy. According to Windsor's calculations, the 2.42-billion-euro fine represents just 22.6 days of the operating cash flow that Alphabet reported in its latest quarter.  What has the potential to hurt Google and be far more damaging is what remedies the European Commission may or may not impose on Google as a result,  Windsor said.  That's where the real damage could be done.  The fine, equivalent to 3 percent of Alphabet's revenue, is the biggest regulatory setback for Google, which settled with U.S. enforcers in 2013 without a penalty after agreeing to change some of its search practices. The Commission's action follows a seven-year investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals such as U.S. consumer review website Yelp, TripAdvisor, UK price comparison site Foundem, News Corp and lobbying group FairSearch. News Corp said it applauded  the European Commission's leadership in confronting the discriminatory behavior of Google in the comparison shopping industry.   We strongly believe that the abuse of algorithms by dominant digital platforms should be of concern to every country and company seeking a fair, competitive and creative society,  it said in a statement, accusing Google of profiting from  commodifying content and enabling the proliferation of flawed and fake news.  The penalty payment for failure to comply would amount to around $12 million a day based on Alphabet's 2016 turnover of $90.3 billion.  This decision is a game-changer. The Commission confirmed that consumers do not see what is most relevant for them on the world’s most used search engine but rather what is best for Google,  said Monique Goyens, director general of EU consumer group BEUC. Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, welcomed the Commission's findings and urged it to act on Google's Android mobile operating system following its 2013 complaint that Google restricted competition in software running on mobile devices.

The annual study by a committee for financial stability in Germany predicted that rates would remain low for some time to come and warned that cheap financing can create incentives for banks to finance projects that maybe riskier than they would otherwise like in an attempt to seek higher returns. The committee, comprising members of the finance ministry, Bundesbank and financial regulators, said the proportion of long-term capital investments financed at low interest rates is growing, increasing cost risks if rates rise sharply.  There is also the danger that market participants systematically underestimate and are in a state of false security with too positive expectations about future political and macroeconomic developments,  they said in the report.  In the event of unfavourable developments, it could lead to abrupt corrections.  Policymakers have cut interest rates to help Europe to weather the financial crisis that hit Greece, Spain and Portugal particularly hard. As the crisis deepened five years ago, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi declared that the ECB was  ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro . A succession of cuts in interest rates to zero followed, and they remain there despite signs that the German economy is gathering pace. Expectations among economists, analysts and corporate executives are for interest rates to remain at historic lows for the foreseeable future. Felix Hufeld, head of the German financial regulator BaFin and a member of the committee, emphasised that it was important to prepare in advance for crises.  It would be grossly irresponsible to only begin to build a fire engine when the house is already burning,  he said.  It should be standing ready in the garage.  In the run-up to the financial crisis, many German life insurers sold savings policies with guaranteed interest rates as high as 4 percent and are now finding it increasingly tough in the current low-rate environment to achieve the returns needed to pay policyholders.  There is a risk that the income generated will no longer be sufficient to meet the long-term commitments,  the report said of the insurers.

Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's main international backer, denounced the warning and dismissed White House assertions that a strike was being prepared as  unacceptable,  raising the tension between Washington and Moscow over the Syrian civil war. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the United States had recently seen activity at Shayrat airfield, the same base targeted by a U.S. cruise missile strike on April 6.  This involved specific aircraft in a specific hangar, both of which we know to be associated with chemical weapons use,  Davis said. Davis said the activity occurred during  the past day or two.  He did not say how the United States collected its intelligence. The White House said on Monday it appeared the Syrian government was preparing for another chemical weapons attack and warned Assad that he and his military would  pay a heavy price  if it went ahead. The U.S. strike on Shayrat followed the deaths of 87 people in what Washington said was a poison gas attack in rebel-held territory two days earlier. Syria denied it carried out the attack.         Russia challenged the U.S. intelligence about a possible attack.  I am not aware of any information about a threat that  chemical weapons can be used,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.

Russian officials have privately described the war in Syria as the biggest source of tension between Moscow and Washington, and the April cruise missile strike ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump raised the risk of confrontation between them.     Assad visited a Russian air base at Hmeymim in western Syria on Tuesday, his first visit to the base from which Russian jets have supported his war effort. Photos circulated showed the Syrian leader in the cockpit of a Russian Sukhoi SU-35 warplane, and inspecting weapons, personnel and armored vehicles at the base near Latakia. u.s.

SANA/Handout via REUTERSThe Syrian military and Foreign Ministry did not comment on the White House warning, although a Syrian state-run television station, al-Ikhbariya, said the allegations were fabricated.     U.S. Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the concerns about preparations for a chemical weapons attack were authentic.  The claims that they made, from my perspective, are valid claims,  he said.  The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said the Trump administration intended its warning to be aimed not just at Syria's government but also at Russia and Iran, another supporter of Assad.  Slideshow (3 Images) I believe that the goal is, at this point, not just to send Assad a message but to send Russia and Iran a message that if this happens again we are putting you on notice,  Haley said in a hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives. She stressed the primary U.S. goal in Syria is to fight Islamic State, not to remove Assad.   I don't see a healthy Syria with Assad in place, but the U.S. priority has and continues to be to fight ISIS,  she said. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democratic member of the foreign affairs and armed services committees, who has been leading a bipartisan push for Congress to debate and vote on the use of military force in Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere, said there was no legal justification for extracting a “heavy price” from Syria. U.S. and allied intelligence officers had for some time identified several sites where they suspected Assad's government  may have been hiding newly made chemical weapons from inspectors, said a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. That assessment was based in part on the locations, security surrounding the suspect sites and other information that the official declined to describe. Although the intelligence was not considered conclusive, Washington decided to issue the public warning to the Syrian leadership to try to deter such a strike, said the official, who declined to discuss the issue further. The number of people killed in suspected chemical attacks is a small portion of the total dead in Syria's civil war - a figure the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, estimates is close to half a million. But television footage of victims of April's attack, including children, writhing in agony, caused revulsion across the world.  After the April attack, Trump accused Assad's government of going  beyond a red line  and approved what U.S. officials called a  one-off  strike to deter future chemical attacks.

All of the 504 women in the study had stress incontinence, which happens when the pelvic muscles are too weak to prevent urinary leakage when women do things like cough, sneeze or exercise. Childbirth is a common reason for weak pelvic muscles and obesity makes the problem worse. Researchers tested what’s known as electroacupuncture, where an electrical current is passed between a pair of acupuncture needles compared to a dummy treatment with similar needles, for six weeks. Women who received electroacupuncture had a greater decrease in urine leakage after treatment and after six months than the participants who got the sham intervention, researchers report in JAMA.  “The safety and effect of electroacupuncture for stress urinary incontinence were comparable to those of pelvic floor muscle training,” an approach currently used in some instances to help women reduce leakage, said senior study author Dr. Baoyan Liu of Guang’an Men Hospital, which is affiliated with the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing.  “Electroacupuncture was effective with rapid response, short treatment period and good compliance,” Liu said by email. “Pelvic floor muscle training takes at least three months with less compliance.” At the start of the study, women in the electroacupuncture group leaked an average of 18.4 grams of urine during a one-hour pad test and had an average of 7.9 episodes of leakage in a typical 72-hour period.  By comparison, women in the sham treatment group had average leakage of 19.4 grams and experienced 7.7 episodes in a typical 72-hour period.  Women assigned to electroacupuncture had 18 sessions over six weeks. The treatment consisted of inserting needles at traditional acupoints in the lumbrosacral region near the small of the back and the back of the pelvis near the hips. Women in the control group got sham electroacupuncture at nonacupoints in the same region of the back.  After six weeks, women who got electroacupuncture had an average decrease in urine leakage of 9.9 grams, compared with a 2.6 gram decrease among women in the group that got the sham treatment. With electroacupuncture, women averaged one less episode of leakage in 72 hours than those in the comparison group.  Over six months, there were also some time periods when electroacupuncture was associated with a bigger reduction in the number of episodes of incontinence, but this didn’t happen consistently.  Side effects associated with treatment such as fatigue and hematoma, or swelling of clotted blood inside tissue, occurred with 1.6 percent of women in the electroacupuncture group and 2 percent of the other participants.  One limitation of the study is the lack of a clinically meaningful reduction in the average amount of urine that leaked before and after treatment, the authors note. They also didn’t assess the amount of urine leaked after treatment stopped.  Researchers also could not be sure that participants were unaware of whether they received real or fake electroacupuncture, which might influence the results people reported experiencing after getting this treatment, the researchers note.  Even so, the results suggest that electroacupuncture, like pelvic muscle exercises, may be a reasonable option for some women with stress urinary incontinence to try before considering surgery for the problem, Dr. Josephine Briggs of the National Center for Complimentary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, writes in an accompanying editorial.  The approach has a long history of success, noted Zhang Jianbin, a researcher at Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Incontinence was already treated by acupuncture in ancient China,” Jianbin said by email. “Many experiences have been accumulated before, and are guiding clinical practice at present.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2udTA3N and bit.ly/2tiZmVq JAMA, online June 27, 2017.

While significant progress has been made in recent years toward making the financial system more stable and resilient, we should not ever be complacent,  Fischer said in prepared remarks to an International Monetary Fund workshop on financial surveillance and communication in Washington. The event was closed to the media but his speech was published by the Federal Reserve. Fischer also said that parts of the financial system deserved extra scrutiny. He noted that the Federal Reserve still lacks sufficient insight into aspects of the shadow banking system and that rising subprime auto and student loan balances and delinquency rates were worrying trends. At first glance such loans appear to be a small enough share of debt to be of little cause for alarm, he noted.  But, on second thought, one should remember that pre-crisis subprime mortgage loans were dismissed as a stability risk because they accounted for only about 13 percent of household mortgages,  Fischer said. Elsewhere, the Fed's number two in command said that risks associated with liquidity and maturity transformation were relatively low and that high-risk appetite had not led to increased leverage across the financial system. Overall  a range of indicators point to vulnerability that is moderate compared to past periods,  he said. Fischer went on to say that new financial technologies will likely carry new risks.

The lawsuit was filed late on Monday by Assured Guaranty Corp and MBIA Inc’s National Public Finance Guarantee, in federal court in San Juan. It is the latest wrangle over a debt workout many had considered a done deal as Puerto Rico battles a crisis marked by $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate. Assured and National, which insure a combined $2.3 billion of PREPA bonds, want a judge to rule the PREPA deal does not need the approval of a financial oversight board created under last year’s federal Puerto Rico rescue law, dubbed PROMESA. PREPA is not part of Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy, and the deal was negotiated largely before PROMESA was passed. “In spite of Congress’s clear intent to preserve the consensual PREPA restructuring, the oversight board has arbitrarily failed to issue the ministerial certification required,” said the 30-page complaint. A spokesman for the board, which is in charge of managing the island's finances, did not respond to a request for comment. Its delay in approving the deal, finalized in April, has irked creditors and sparked debate among lawmakers. U.S. Representative Rob Bishop told the board in a June 15 letter the delay was “troubling” and “outside the scope” of PROMESA. House Democrats Nydia Velazquez and Raul Grijalva disagreed, saying on June 16 the board had “clear authority” to assess the deal, and should reject it because it could increase electricity costs. While the board need not determine whether the deal fits guidelines for agreements forged under PROMESA, it still must decide whether to authorize the issuance of new debt, which could give the board an effective veto if it feels the deal could hurt Puerto Rico's economy. Under the agreement, which has been through multiple iterations since restructuring talks began nearly three years ago, PREPA creditors would accept 15 percent repayment cuts in exchange for new debt backed by a charge on customer bills. Insurers would pay a surety to shore up the new debt, and accept an additional $300 million in principal deferrals. National insures some $3.6 billion of total Puerto Rico bonds, while Assured wraps another $4.9 billion.

Colette Honorable, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said at a conference that renewables have different attributes than base load power, which includes coal and nuclear energy, and that those difference need to be overcome.  But Honorable stressed that record amounts of wind and solar power had been generated recently without harming the grid.   Do I recognize we have to be attendant to supporting the different ways in which renewables work? Yes,  said Honorable, who was appointed by former president Barack Obama, a Democrat, and who will step down on Friday.   I don't see any problems with reliability, and I say bring on more renewables,  said Honorable, whose remarks generated warm applause at a conference of the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration arm.  President Donald Trump, a Republican, has embarked on a program to dismantle Obama's clean-energy policies as renewable power generation hits records.  In February, wind briefly powered more than 50 percent of electricity demand in the 14-state Southwest Power Pool, for the first time on any North American grid.  In March, wind and solar accounted for more than 10 percent of U.S. electricity generation for the first time. The Energy Department is expected to release the grid study in July. It will take a critical look at the role that renewable energy policies have played in the closure of coal and nuclear electricity plants and see if the loss of those facilities has reduced the grid's stability.   Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who in April called on the Energy Department staff to initiate the study, told the EIA conference that it would be a  critical review of regulatory burdens  placed by the Obama administration on base load power plants.   These politically driven policies, driven primarily by a hostility to coal, threaten the reliability and stability of the greatest electrical grid in the world,  Perry said. The country's natural gas boom and the growth of renewables have played a large role in closing coal plants.  Perry said the Trump administration was working to find an energy mix that is clean and affordable while ensuring the grid is reliable.

While significant progress has been made in recent years toward making the financial system more stable and resilient, we should not ever be complacent,  Fischer said in prepared remarks to an International Monetary Fund workshop on financial surveillance and communication in Washington. The event was closed to the media but his speech was published by the Federal Reserve. Fischer also said that parts of the financial system deserved extra scrutiny. He noted that the Federal Reserve still lacks sufficient insight into aspects of the shadow banking system and that rising subprime auto and student loan balances and delinquency rates were worrying trends. At first glance such loans appear to be a small enough share of debt to be of little cause for alarm, he noted.  But, on second thought, one should remember that pre-crisis subprime mortgage loans were dismissed as a stability risk because they accounted for only about 13 percent of household mortgages,  Fischer said. Elsewhere, the Fed's number two in command said that risks associated with liquidity and maturity transformation were relatively low and that high-risk appetite had not led to increased leverage across the financial system. Overall  a range of indicators point to vulnerability that is moderate compared to past periods,  he said. Fischer went on to say that new financial technologies will likely carry new risks.

Forcing banks to hold bigger capital buffers, as the Bank of England governor did on Tuesday, is a finely honed way of reining in frothy consumer finance. But eventually Carney and his colleagues will have to push through the higher borrowing costs they keep warning lenders about. If interest rates are the heavy machinery of economic management, the counter-cyclical capital buffer is more precise. It allows regulators to raise and lower capital ratios, thereby influencing banks’ ability to cope with shocks. Following last year’s Brexit referendum, the BoE’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) lowered the buffer to zero. It has now lifted the ratio back up to 0.5 percent, and scheduled a similar increase for November. All in, the minimum amount of capital that UK banks have to hold will increase by 11.4 billion pounds by November 2018. The industry can cope with the demands: UK banks’ combined common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.9 percent in March, and their combined leverage ratio is over 5 percent, well above the BoE’s proposed minimum of 3.25 percent. Shares in most British lenders closed higher on Tuesday. Even so, the FPC remains worried about signs of excess, particularly in car finance and credit cards. UK consumer borrowing jumped 10 percent in the year to April, far exceeding growth in income. Higher interest rates could leave borrowers struggling to service their loans, and lenders with higher bad debt. But warning about higher rates is no substitute for the real thing. It’s a decade since the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee last increased official borrowing costs. Some rate-setters are getting itchy: three of the MPC’s eight members voted to raise rates in June, and while one is leaving, BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane has hinted he may join them next time.  On Tuesday Carney batted away accusations, voiced by departing MPC member Kristin Forbes in a speech last week, that broader post-crisis responsibilities – which include worrying about financial stability - had distracted the central bank from fighting inflation. Even so, the blunt tool of higher rates cannot remain in the box forever.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

About 70 percent of India's power generation is fired by coal. The country is the world's third-largest producer and third-biggest importer of coal, which the government wants to change by boosting local coal production. Fresh coal production should come from private sector mines, the government think-tank NITI Aayog said, adding that the move called for reforms in allocating coal blocks to independent companies specialised in coal mining. (bit.ly/2rXZmWK) Coal India was not available for comment after its regular business hours. Reuters reported in December that senior Indian government officials, tasked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with reviewing energy security, were recommending the break up of the world's largest coal miner within a year. Attempts to break up the world's biggest coal miner could expect resistance from powerful unions representing the firm's more than 350,000 employees. The government backed down from a similar proposal in the face of union protests in 2014. One of the unions, which is close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party, is against the move and says it has the support of about half of Coal India's workers.  We are opposing the recommendations made by NITI Aayog,  Baij Nath Rai, president of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, told Reuters by telephone. Coal India, the country's second-biggest employer, is often criticized for being bloated and inefficient.

Two former bankers at Lloyds' HBOS Reading business were among those jailed in February for their involvement in the scam, which affected 64 people, including Noel Edmonds, a TV presenter and former disc jockey. Lloyds set up a 100 million pound ($128 million) compensation scheme in April and set the end-June deadline for payment to victims hit by the fraud, which involved siphoning off money from struggling businesses. According to one source with knowledge of the matter, less than a fifth of the 64 victims have received compensation offers and only one has reached a settlement with the bank. Edmonds is seeking more than 70 million pounds in compensation for businesses he alleges were destroyed by the fraud. He has set up a website with an  honesty countdown  clock showing the time remaining for Lloyds to meet its self-imposed deadline. Lloyds on Tuesday said it now plans to make compensation offers to some customers by the end of June. Others  might need more time to provide input into the review,  it said. A bank spokesman said in an email:  Our focus is on swift, fair and appropriate compensation.  HBOS, once Britain's biggest mortgage lender under the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands, had to be rescued in a state-engineered takeover in 2008 by rival Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds subsequently needed a 20 billion pound bailout of its own after taking on HBOS. Victims of the fraud have accused the bank of dragging out the compensation process and underestimating the final amount it will have to pay.  Lloyds clearly just want to grind down its fraud victims by a process of attrition, making the process of getting recompense as difficult and frustrating as possible to force them into accepting less than their entitlement,  Jonathan Coad, a lawyer for Edmonds said. Godfrey Cromwell, the co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Fair Banking, said the current system of compensation was not working and they were seeking a meeting with Lloyds to discuss the subject. Victims appear  to have received little compensation and remain very anxious and uncertain as to how and when it will be provided,  Cromwell, a member of the House of Lords, said in a statement. The jailed bankers pushed struggling business owners to employ a costly turnaround consultancy as a condition for receiving loans and, in some cases, hand over ownership.

Speaking at a European Central Bank conference in Sintra, Portugal, Draghi said deflationary forces had been replaced by inflationary ones. But any change in the bank's stance, which includes sub-zero rates and massive bond purchases, should be gradual as  considerable  monetary support is still needed and the rebound in inflation will also depend on favourable global financing conditions. For investors, the remarks were a departure from the cautious tone adopted at a post-meeting news conference earlier this month, sparking a sell-off across euro zone bonds.  My reading is that on the policy front there hasn't been a whole lot of change but if you compare it to the comments after the ECB meeting, they were on the hawkish side,  said Antoine Bouvet, a rates strategist at Mizuho.  He was quite optimistic that wages will pick up.  The yield on Germany's two-year bond, also facing pressure from new bond supply on Tuesday, rose 5 basis points to minus 0.56 percent, its highest in a year. German 10-year bond yields soared over 10 basis points to a one-month high at 0.35 percent and were on track for their biggest one-day jump since April. Across the single currency area, euro zone bond yields were 10-13 bps higher on the day. The euro also rallied after Draghi's comments, hitting a nine-month high of $1.1304, up 1.06 percent on the day.  He (Draghi) has been speaking more about the medium term and the ECB being a bit more sure that inflation will return to target,  said Cathal Kennedy, European economist at RBC in London.  But I don't think the message is significantly different to what we have heard before. There seems to be a bit of market overreaction.  Draghi was the first of a number of central bankers slated to speak on Tuesday. In Britain, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney spoke at a news conference after the BoE tightened its control on bank credit Janet Yellen, who chairs the U.S. Federal Reserve, speaks in London later in the day.

The outlook for real estate, however, remains very strong, though investors will need to search to find attractive income streams and sources of growth that can deliver target returns, said the investment management arm of Prudential Financial Inc . There is no evidence of mispricing in major markets, leverage has been reduced and prime real estate is priced around fair value, said Peter Hayes, PGIM's global head of investment research.  There is no obvious trigger out there that would point to a collapse in real estate values,  he said.  There's definite investor nervousness, that's always been the case. But there's no evidence of systemic risk,  he said. PGIM, which manages $65.9 billion in real estate assets, said opportunities can be found in the non-gateway U.S. markets such as Dallas and Phoenix and non-central business districts in Asia and Europe where office rental demand looks strong. Ongoing demand for warehousing in the United States and elsewhere because of e-commerce and the world's growing middle class, which is driving tourism, especially in Asia due to the Chinese, also offer opportunities, PGIM said in a presentation. But caution, which has reigned since the global financial crisis, still prevails as investors take their foot off the pedal a little bit after the superior returns from 2010-2015, Hayes said. In core U.S. real estate assets those returns were in the mid-teens and now will likely be in the high single digits, said Eric Adler, chief executive of PGIM Real Estate. The number of global transactions fell in 2016 but were still high from a historical perspective, suggesting continued competition for deals, PGIM said. However, the amount of capital targeting real estate has dropped slightly and pricing pressure in global markets has cooled, it said. Eight global gateway cities - London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington - account for about one-third of cross-border deals, Hayes said.

Kushner took on Abbe D. Lowell, the newspaper said, joining other senior administration figures including U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Vice President Mike Pence and Trump himself in hiring private attorneys. The White House has come under increased scrutiny since Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller and a number of congressional committees launched investigations into whether there were ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 election campaign team.  Trump and his key aides have repeatedly denied any collusion with Moscow. Mueller is examining Kushner’s meetings with the Russian ambassador and a Russian banker as part of a broad enquiry, the New York Times said. But there are no signs that Kushner is the target of an investigation and Kushner has promised to cooperate, the newspaper added. The 36-year-old Kushner, a real estate developer with no previous government experience, had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States during and after the 2016 presidential campaign, seven current and former U.S. officials told Reuters in May. When Mueller became special counsel in May, he left a job at WilmerHale, a legal firm that also employs another lawyer for Kushner, Jamie Gorelick.     When Bob Mueller left WilmerHale to become special counsel and three of our colleagues joined him, we asked Mr. Kushner to get independent legal advice on whether to continue with us as his counsel,  Gorelick said in a statement to the Times.   He engaged Abbe Lowell to advise him and then decided to add Mr. Lowell to the team representing him in the various inquiries into the Russia matter,  she said.  Trump on Monday demanded that investigators apologize for looking into Russian interference and possible collusion with his election campaign, accusing predecessor President Barack Obama of having  colluded or obstructed,  but he did not provide evidence. Russia has said it did not interfere in the vote.

Two former bankers at Lloyds' HBOS Reading business were among those jailed in February for their involvement in the scam, which affected 64 people, including Noel Edmonds, a TV presenter and former disc jockey. Lloyds set up a 100 million pound ($128 million) compensation scheme in April and set the end-June deadline for payment to victims hit by the fraud, which involved siphoning off money from struggling businesses. According to one source with knowledge of the matter, less than a fifth of the 64 victims have received compensation offers and only one has reached a settlement with the bank. Edmonds is seeking more than 70 million pounds in compensation for businesses he alleges were destroyed by the fraud. He has set up a website with an  honesty countdown  clock showing the time remaining for Lloyds to meet its self-imposed deadline. Lloyds on Tuesday said it now plans to make compensation offers to some customers by the end of June. Others  might need more time to provide input into the review,  it said. A bank spokesman said in an email:  Our focus is on swift, fair and appropriate compensation.  HBOS, once Britain's biggest mortgage lender under the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands, had to be rescued in a state-engineered takeover in 2008 by rival Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds subsequently needed a 20 billion pound bailout of its own after taking on HBOS. Victims of the fraud have accused the bank of dragging out the compensation process and underestimating the final amount it will have to pay.  Lloyds clearly just want to grind down its fraud victims by a process of attrition, making the process of getting recompense as difficult and frustrating as possible to force them into accepting less than their entitlement,  Jonathan Coad, a lawyer for Edmonds said. Godfrey Cromwell, the co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Fair Banking, said the current system of compensation was not working and they were seeking a meeting with Lloyds to discuss the subject. Victims appear  to have received little compensation and remain very anxious and uncertain as to how and when it will be provided,  Cromwell, a member of the House of Lords, said in a statement. The jailed bankers pushed struggling business owners to employ a costly turnaround consultancy as a condition for receiving loans and, in some cases, hand over ownership. One of the bankers received designer watches, exotic holidays and sex with prostitutes in return for referring clients to the consultancy, evidence presented in the trial showed. The delay in compensation is adding to the stress of victims, some of whom have lost their homes or investments and had families crumble, said Nikki Turner, one of the victims who helped to uncover the fraud with husband Paul.

A convoy of three pick-up trucks were transporting over 70 migrants north through the Sahara Desert towards Libya -- a typical route for West Africans seeking to reach Europe --   when the drivers abandoned them.      Twenty-three of the migrants survived after walking to a nearby town for help, the International Organization for Migration said in a press release on Tuesday, which said the survivors came from Nigeria, Gambia, Ivory Coast and Senegal. A local official told Reuters that of the remaining 52, at least 15 were known to have died from thirst while attempts on Monday to find the rest were unsuccessful. There was no immediate word on their nationalities.  The migrants were abandoned about 50 miles from Siguidine,  Fatoumi Goudou, a prefect in the Bilma department of Niger, told Reuters. It is not clear why the drivers abandoned their passengers, but rival militias and militants seeking money often stop migrant convoys and are a constant hazard for smugglers.  Hundreds of thousands of impoverished West Africans risk their lives crossing the Sahara each year to try to reach Europe, crammed on the back of pick-up trucks and with few provisions to survive if something goes wrong. It is one of the most dangerous parts of the journey, though the number of deaths in the vast and unpopulated region is hard to track. Some estimate that thousands die each year -- more than in the Mediterranean sea between Africa and Europe. Over 40 West African migrants died of thirst last month in northern Niger after their truck broke down.

Pakistan's government said the State Department designation of Syed Salahuddin as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist was unjustified. Salahuddin heads the Hizbul Mujahideen militant group, based in the Pakistan-administered side of Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan and claimed in whole by both. Hizbul Mujahideen is the biggest militant fighting group Indian forces in Kashmir. Unlike Lashkar-e- Taiba and other groups operating from Pakistan soil, the Hizb is a largely indigenous Kashmir group.  The U.S. announcement came on the day Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the White House on Monday for his first talks with President Donald Trump. In Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistani Kashmir, hundreds staged a rally to condemn the move and burned an Indian flag on the ground.  Syed Salahuddin ... is not a terrorist, but a freedom fighter,  read a huge banner. India, which blames Pakistan for stoking the 28-year-old revolt in Muslim-majority Kashmir, has stepped up efforts to put pressure on Pakistan under Modi. Pakistan denies giving material help to Kashmiri separatists but reiterated on Tuesday it would continue to provide diplomatic and moral support to the Kashmiri struggle for self-determination. Indian security forces have been accused by activists and rights groups of killing up to 100 separatist protesters since new mass anti-India demonstrations broke out in September. Pakistan's Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan said the U.S. decision  appears as if they do not attach any importance to the blood of innocent Kashmiris .  At the talks on Monday, Modi and Trump called on Pakistan to ensure that its territory is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries, the White House said. In its announcement, the State Department said that in September 2016, Salahuddin had threatened to train more Kashmiri suicide bombers and vowed to turn the Kashmir valley  into a graveyard for Indian forces . As a consequence of the designation, U.S. individuals are banned from engaging in financial transactions with Salahuddin and all his property in the United States is blocked. Salahuddin, who is from Badgam town in Indian-administered Kashmir, was an Islamist politician who turned to militancy after he lost an election for the Kashmir legislative assembly in 1987, which he says was  massively rigged  by India.

In my view we want to put that on autopilot and to use the Fed funds rate as the variable that we would move depending on how the data transpires.

The Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates for the second time this year last month but it was only the fourth time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers ignited the global financial crisis.

The Outlook on the Long-Term IDR has been revised to Stable from Negative. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. The rating action reflects the greater clarity about the operational and financial effect of the diesel issue. Fitch acknowledges that risks of further legal actions have not disappeared but believes that these risks have become manageable at the current rating level and incorporated in the ratings. In particular, we believe that the group could accommodate several billion euros in additional fines and/or recall and repair costs and still sustain its current ratings. In addition, the group has demonstrated a strong resilience since the start of the emissions crisis in late 2015 and we expect only a limited impact on credit metrics at the exit point by 2019-2020, when the bulk of cash outflows will have hit free cash flow (FCF) and net debt. Fitch believes that all car manufacturers now face financial and operational risks related to emission legislation, regulators' investigations and customers' complaints. These risks and their rating impact will be treated on a case-by-case basis as they emerge, including for Volkswagen. Therefore, a sudden acceleration of current legal actions or the emergence of major new litigation leading to an actual or potential breach of Fitch's negative rating sensitivities, will put renewed pressure on the ratings. In particular, legal actions engulfing the profitable Audi brand could be negative for the ratings. KEY RATING DRIVERS Greater Clarity on Diesel Issue: Investigations and legal actions are reaching an end in the US where the emission crisis started and we have gained more clarity about the total cost of this issue which will be between EUR20-25 billion. Investigations are, however, not over in other countries and we believe that risks of further class actions and legal cases will remain acute in the coming 12-18 months. In particular, a key risk is if investigations engulf Audi and severely impact this brand, which is a core cash generator for the group. Nonetheless, we gain comfort from the group's track record in managing the crisis in the US and its ability to absorb the substantial costs already levied. Firstly, the cash outflows will be spread over several years and will be partly offset by Volkswagen's solid underlying cash generation. Secondly, the effect on the group's reputation and brands has been quite limited outside the US and sales have not fallen as significantly as was expected when the scandal erupted. Thirdly, Volkswagen's financial flexibility remains adequate to accommodate further cash outflows without breaching our debt-related negative rating sensitivities. Emissions Crisis Hit Profitability: Volkswagen's industrial operating margin, before exceptional items related to the diesel issue, increased to 5.8% in 2016 from 5.3% in 2015, excluding the robust double-digit margins from Chinese joint ventures. However, the group booked a further EUR6.4 billion of provisions for the emissions crisis in 2016 on top of the EUR16.2 billion provisions taken in 2015. Furthermore, the core Volkswagen brand's profitability declined further to 1.8% in 2016 from 4.0% in 2011, highlighting the relentless challenges in streamlining the cost structure. Fitch expects a recovery in the industrial operating margin before extraordinary charges to more than 7% through 2019 as the company continues to restructure and reaps the benefit of several new models. We also believe that the majority of costs related to the emissions crisis have been accounted for, significantly decreasing the financial uncertainty linked to the diesel issue. FCF to Suffer: The FCF margin declined further to 0.7% in 2016, but we project a substantial effect from the emissions crisis in 2017-2019 as provisions taken in 2015 and 2016 will convert into cash outflows. We assume the total cost of the emissions crisis to amount to just less than EUR25 billion. The group has already reached several agreements worth an equivalent of EUR22 billion with various US parties to settle criminal, civil and environmental claims. Nonetheless, lawsuits and claims remain open in several countries and could entail further cash outflows. Governance Below Peers': Key areas of corporate governance weakness include a 20% blocking minority in voting resolutions, potential conflicts of interest on the part of some board members, and lack of independence and diversity at the supervisory board level. The emissions crisis has also highlighted serious internal control issues. We acknowledge the measures taken by the new management to strengthen corporate governance as well as the progress made in reshuffling management and reporting lines, but we also believe that their implementation and an overhaul of the company's culture may take time and meet resistance. Strong Business Profile: The ratings are supported by the group's unparalleled product portfolio in the auto and heavy-truck segments. They also reflect Volkswagen's broad diversification, leading market shares and an unrivalled potential for cost savings and economies of scale. The group is also refocusing its strategy on sustained mobility, including electric vehicles, and on new sector trends such as autonomous vehicles, car sharing and ride hailing. DERIVATION SUMMARY Weak corporate governance remains a rating constraint following the downgrade to 'BBB+', but the ratings are supported by the group's solid business profile and resilient financial profile. Volkswagen is the largest car manufacturer in Europe and is competing head-to-head with Toyota as the largest group globally. Its scale enables an industrial strategy of platform consolidation and a massive potential for synergies across its broad brand portfolio. However, the group's structure has not yet enabled these potential synergies to fully accrue to operating profit. Volkswagen is the most diversified auto manufacturer in the world along with Toyota, with substantial product and geographic exposure as well as production diversification. The group's individual brands have a lower value than other premium manufacturers, such as BMW and Daimler's Mercedes, or other large and recognised global manufacturers including Honda and Toyota, but it owns several brands with strong image. Profitability took a major hit in 2015 and 2016 from exceptional items related to the emissions crisis. Excluding such costs, the group's earnings remain solid in spite of the weak performance of the core Volkswagen brand. The operating margin is lower than for premium manufacturers such as BMW, Daimler and JLR, but compares favourably with other volume manufacturers. Profitability was more resilient than other European groups' during the 2008-2009 crisis. FCF generation is extremely robust, in line with the highest-rated manufacturers, but will suffer from outflows related to the emissions scandal over the next few years, particularly in 2017-2019. Likewise, cash outflows related to the emissions scandal will take their toll on leverage in 2017-2019. However, following the downgrade to the 'BBB' category, leverage is now low for the ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - industrial operations' revenue increasing in the low to mid-single digits in 2017-2019; - industrial operating margin rebounding to more than 7% in 2017, excluding exceptional items, and remaining between 7%-7.5% through 2109, driven notably by a rebound of the Volkswagen PC division to more than 4% and a moderate recovery at Audi of between 8.5%-9% by 2019; - further exceptional charges of about EUR1 billion in 2017, related to the emissions crisis. Total cash outflows of EUR24 billion spread over 2017 (EUR16 billion) to 2019; - capex to fall moderately to around EUR18 billion in 2017-2018 and increase to more than EUR20 billion in 2019; - neutral working-capital movement on average over 2017-2019, including a large inflow in 2017, partially reversing the 2016 substantial outflow; - dividend payment reinitiated in 2017 increasing to more than EUR3 billion by 2019. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Tighter corporate governance practices - Evidence that core brands have not been impaired by the emission test crisis Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Further material reputational damage to the group and its brands - Further substantial negative findings as a result of ongoing investigations - Operating margins remaining below 3% (for industrial operations) and 4% (at group level) (industrial: 2016: 6.6%, 2017E: 7.3%, 2018E: 7.1% -- group: 2016: 3.3%, 2017E: 6.9%, 2018E: 7.2%) - Significant deterioration in key credit metrics, including FFO adjusted gross and net leverage above 2x and 1.5x, respectively, (gross: 2016: 1.1x, 2017E: 0.9x, 2018E: 0.9x ; net: 2016: -0.1x, 2017E: 0.2x, 2018E: 0.1x) - Cash from operations on adjusted debt below 50% (2016: 99%, 2017E: 131%, 2018E: 127%) LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity: We expect liquidity to remain healthy despite the substantial upcoming cash drains. It is supported by EUR23 billion in cash and securities at end-2016 after Fitch's adjustments for operational and non-readily available cash and an unused EUR5 billion credit line maturing in 2020. In addition, syndicated credit lines worth a total of EUR2.4 billion at other group companies were available at end-2016. Group companies had also arranged bilateral, confirmed credit lines with national and international banks in various countries for a total of EUR8.5 billion, of which EUR2.6 billion was drawn down.

The defection of several Monetary Policy Committee officials to the camp supporting a rise in base interest rates has given the pound, battered by another round of political uncertainty after this month's elections, some support in the past week. On the one hand, reinstating the minimum 0.5 percent of risk-weighted assets that banks are asked to hold as a buffer against shocks to consumer finances was a sign of confidence in an economy that has looked to be slowing.  But it may also take any unwanted steam out of areas of loan growth that could otherwise be cited as one reason for raising rates, helping policymakers hold off for longer with any hike in the Bank's main borrowing rates.  When you're looking at the buffer, they have increased it, and that is a marginal tightening of monetary conditions, and hence possibly a plus for the pound,  said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam.   For now, I think, sterling is stuck in a range between $1.26 and $1.28.  Sterling did gain against the dollar - rising 0.4 percent to $1.2774 - but that appeared to be mainly a by-product of the euro's full percentage point gain against the greenback due to comments on monetary policy by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi. Against the euro, the pound fell 0.6 percent to 88.41 pence, hitting its weakest level in two weeks. EURGBP=  Derek Halpenny, a strategist with MUFG in London, has been one of the bank analysts calling for a rise in sterling in recent months, judging that the worst of the pound's Brexit-led sell-off is now in the price.  But he also says the uncertainty generated by Prime Minister Theresa May's loss of her parliamentary majority in elections on June 8 has made it harder for sterling to rise in the near term.  May has sealed the deal she needs to approve a stripped-down legislative programme, but many political commentators still expect another election to be called in the next year under a new Conservative leader. Halpenny said the progress of the talks on Britain's departure from the European Union should be crucial to sterling in the coming weeks.    While macroeconomics might start to have a greater influence, the big events are still Brexit-related,  he said.  The sooner this first stage of talks is over, and we can get on to what investors really care about - the negotiating of a smooth transition period - the better (for the pound).

The justices will review a federal appeals court's ruling last year that the 2014 New Jersey statute permitting sports betting at casinos and racetracks violated a 1992 federal law that prohibits such gambling in all states except Nevada, Delaware, Montana and Oregon.  New Jersey had asked the Supreme Court to hear its appeal of an August 2016 ruling by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that its law violated the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act. New Jersey argues that the federal law infringes upon state sovereignty as laid out in the U.S. Constitution. Courts have voided two New Jersey laws, also including one in 2012, designed to raise revenue for state coffers through sports betting. The law now at issue would ban wagers on state college teams and limit bets to people age 21 and older at casinos and racetracks. In January, the Supreme Court had asked the incoming Trump administration to offer its views on whether the justices should take up New Jersey's appeal, and the administration advised against it. Christie, a Republican, served as an advisor to President Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race but was removed as the head of Trump's transition team after the election. Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, the National Hockey League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association all oppose New Jersey's law.

Guidelines adopted by the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) require players showing any potential signs of concussion after a head collision to be immediately withdrawn from play and assessed by sideline healthcare personnel, researchers note in JAMA.  But when they examined video footage of all 64 matches in the 2014 World Cup held in Brazil, researchers only saw medical professionals examine players for concussions in 12 instances accounting for just 15 percent of the head collisions seen on the field.  “Patients suspected of concussion need to be properly assessed by medical professionals prior to being potentially exposed to repeated injury in rapid succession,” Cusimano said by email. “In some instances these repeated injuries can lead to fatal or lifelong disabling consequences.” Researchers focused on players who had at least two observable signs of concussion such as athletes clutching their heads, being slow to get up, disoriented, displaying obvious disequilibrium, unconsciousness or seizure-like movements. A total of 61 athletes had 81 head collisions in 72 separate events, the study found. Among the minority of athletes examined by healthcare professionals, 11 were cleared to return to play and three were removed from the match or tournament, the study found.  Exams done by health providers averaged just 107 seconds, though assessments ranged from 64 seconds to 180 seconds.  Of the 81 collisions researchers observed in the game video, 14 players showed one or no signs of concussion, 45 had two signs and 22 had three or more signs.  Out of the 67 cases when players showed at least two signs of potential concussion, 11 received no assessment and returned to play immediately, while 27 got checked out by another player or referee and then went back to the game.  For the 22 players with three or more concussion signs, 19 returned to play during the same game after an average exam time of 84 seconds. Limitations of the study include the potential that exams were not recorded by game video that followed action on the field rather than activity on the sidelines, the authors note. Not all collisions involve injuries, and athletes may feign injury to draw a foul or downplay injury to remain in the game.  It’s also possible that video footage didn’t show every collision, and may have underestimated how many occurred, said Tamara Valovich McLeod co-author of the National Athletic Trainers' Association position statement on management of sport concussion and director of athletic training programs at A.T. Still University’s Arizona School of Health Sciences in Mesa. Even so, too few players got checked out and none were examined long enough, McLeod told Reuters Health by email. A thorough concussion assessment takes about 10 minutes, she said.  FIFA guidelines now dictate that play halt for three minutes to allow an on-pitch concussion assessment, noted Anthony Kontos, research director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Sports Medicine Concussion Program.  “There has been an increased focus on concussions in soccer at all levels,” Kontos, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “However, there are lingering issues regarding substitutions rules and lack of time stoppages in soccer to allow for evaluation of players without disrupting the game and potentially disadvantaging a team who has to play short while a player is evaluated.  The trouble is youth soccer leagues may take their cues on concussions from the World Cup, said Dr. Sara Chrisman of the Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center in Seattle.  “Most competitive youth sport athletes follow professional teams and look to them to set the norms as to how to handle injury,” Chrisman, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “If a professional sporting organization does not take concussion seriously, it sends a message that youth athletes should also not take concussion seriously.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sXmupm JAMA, online June 27, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-concussion-world-cup-idUSKBN19I28B"}, 
{"news_time":"2017-06-27 11:59:00","news_title":"Sprint, cable wireless talks scramble deal outlook","keywords":"Germany,Japan,Craig Moffett,Jonathan Chaplin,SPRINT CORP,STOCKS/ (UPDATE 2),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Sprint Corp's talks with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp about a wireless partnership added another layer of uncertainty to the outlook for potential deals in the cable and telecommunications sector. Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast, while putting merger talks with T-Mobile US Inc on hold until the end of July, sources told Reuters late on Monday. Sprint shares were up nearly 6 percent to $8.46 in late Tuesday morning New York Stock Exchange trading. There has been widespread speculation that the end of the U.S. Federal Communication Commission's latest spectrum auction would trigger a wave of consolidation in the telecommunications and cable sectors. Executives have openly talked about potential tie-ups, but no mergers have been struck. Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, described Sprint's talks to provide the backbone for a wireless network for Comcast and Charter as a  three-way hedge  for the companies.  From a game theory perspective, this is a fascinating move,  Moffett wrote in an email. The two cable companies are hedging for a possible tie-up between Sprint and T-Mobile that could reduce their negotiating leverage, and the wireless deal also allows Sprint to hedge against the risk that a merger with T-Mobile never happens, the analyst said. A wireless deal with Comcast and Charter would also give Sprint somewhat more negotiating leverage if it does secure a tie-up with T-Mobile, he added. New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin characterized Sprint's move as a clear negative for T-Mobile, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc. T-Mobile's shares fell 1.6 percent to $62.12, while those of Comcast fell less than 1 percent to $39.30. Charter's shares were little changed at $331.26. JPMorgan analysts said if the talks with Charter and Comcast failed, Sprint's negotiating position could weaken if it were to restart merger talks with T-Mobile, which is controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG. And if Sprint and T-Mobile merger talks fall apart, that could strengthen the case for a tie-up between T-Mobile and Dish Network Corp, Jefferies analysts said in a note. Dish shares were up 1.5 percent at $64.80 on Tuesday. Analysts have speculated that Dish, a satellite TV provider that has also been buying up spectrum, could be an attractive acquisition target for both Verizon and T-Mobile. Comcast and Charter announced a wireless partnership in May in a bid to offset customer attrition as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Both cable companies already have network-resale or mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreements with Verizon. MVNOs do not own networks, and instead rent capacity from established operators to sell on to their customers, usually at low prices due to their small overheads, with cheap distribution through the internet or convenience stores. The cable companies' agreement with Verizon restricts them to offer wireless within their own service areas, while a deal with Sprint could allow them to offer the service nationally, the analysts said. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the negotiations between the companies on Monday, said Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. A minority equity investment was being discussed but that it may not be part of any deal, sources told Reuters. Charter and Comcast could also look at jointly acquiring Sprint, but that is unlikely, the sources said. AT&T; shares tumbled 1 percent to $37.75 and Verizon shares were down 1.6 percent at $45.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/sprint-corp-stocks-idUSL1N1JO0YR"},

Energy and bank sector stocks rose on Wall Street, leaving the S&P; 500 and a global equities index little changed on the day. The euro hit its highest since early September versus the greenback at $1.1304 as Draghi, speaking to a conference in Portugal, said the ECB could adjust its policy tools as economic prospects improve in Europe.  Just the fact that the ECB is considering their options right now is considered to be a hawkish signal,  said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York. The dollar index fell 0.7 percent, with the euro up 1.03 percent to $1.1294. But the Japanese yen weakened 0.52 percent versus the greenback at 112.44 per dollar. Sterling was last trading at $1.278, up 0.47 percent on the day. The Bank of England raised banks' capital requirements and warned about levels of credit growth in pockets of the economy. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to take part in a discussion in London at 1:00 p.m. ET (1700 UTC). If her comments support the Fed's forecast of further monetary policy tightening this year, the dollar could bounce back.  Her words will be scrutinized for any color about the timing of the next rate hike against a backdrop of mounting concerns over the inflation outlook,  strategists at Societe Generale said in a note to clients. Also due to speak on Tuesday was Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer. The dollar weakness helped boost crude futures prices, though the backdrop of a long-standing supply glut kept gains in check. U.S. crude rose 2.21 percent to $44.34 per barrel and Brent was last at $46.90, up 2.33 percent on the day. Ian Taylor, head of the world's largest independent oil trader Vitol, told Reuters that Brent prices would stay in a range of $40-$55 a barrel for the next few quarters.  In the third quarter we should draw (down stocks), but we are unsure about the fourth quarter as U.S. production is likely to have a year-end spurt,  Taylor said. On Wall Street, energy stocks tracked the price of oil higher while banks also helped keep the S&P; 500 afloat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 25.3 points, or 0.12 percent, to 21,434.85, the S&P; 500 gained 0.65 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,439.72 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 19.60 points, or 0.31 percent, to 6,227.55. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.70 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.02 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.17 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.14 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.36 percent. U.S. Treasury yields rose in sympathy with European government debt weakness, after Draghi's comments. “He surprised the market with that upbeat stance,” said Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global in New York. “The European government bond market didn’t take it very well.” Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.2016 percent, from 2.137 percent late on Monday. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, with the spread between five-year notes and 30-year bonds dropping to a low of 92.7 basis points. That was the flattest level since late 2007. In corporate news, the EU slapped a record 2.42 billion euro fine on Alphabet's Google saying it had abused its dominant market position. Google said it was considering an appeal. Alphabet shares fell 1.1 percent. Gold prices, which tumbled to their lowest level in nearly six weeks on Monday, were supported by the softer dollar. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,246.35 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.09 percent to $1,247.50 an ounce. Copper rose 1.10 percent to $5,858.00 a tonne.

The defection of several Monetary Policy Committee officials to the camp supporting a rise in base interest rates has given the pound, battered by another round of political uncertainty after this month's elections, some support in the past week. On the one hand, reinstating the minimum 0.5 percent of risk-weighted assets that banks are asked to hold as a buffer against shocks to consumer finances was a sign of confidence in an economy that has looked to be slowing.  But it may also take any unwanted steam out of areas of loan growth that could otherwise be cited as one reason for raising rates, helping policymakers hold off for longer with any hike in the Bank's main borrowing rates.  When you're looking at the buffer, they have increased it, and that is a marginal tightening of monetary conditions, and hence possibly a plus for the pound,  said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam.   For now, I think, sterling is stuck in a range between $1.26 and $1.28.  Sterling did gain against the dollar - rising 0.4 percent to $1.2774 - but that appeared to be mainly a by-product of the euro's full percentage point gain against the greenback due to comments on monetary policy by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi. Against the euro, the pound fell 0.6 percent to 88.41 pence, hitting its weakest level in two weeks. EURGBP=  Derek Halpenny, a strategist with MUFG in London, has been one of the bank analysts calling for a rise in sterling in recent months, judging that the worst of the pound's Brexit-led sell-off is now in the price.  But he also says the uncertainty generated by Prime Minister Theresa May's loss of her parliamentary majority in elections on June 8 has made it harder for sterling to rise in the near term.  May has sealed the deal she needs to approve a stripped-down legislative programme, but many political commentators still expect another election to be called in the next year under a new Conservative leader. Halpenny said the progress of the talks on Britain's departure from the European Union should be crucial to sterling in the coming weeks.    While macroeconomics might start to have a greater influence, the big events are still Brexit-related,  he said.  The sooner this first stage of talks is over, and we can get on to what investors really care about - the negotiating of a smooth transition period - the better (for the pound).

The two dominant operators are in talks with wireless carrier Sprint that may include a range of options from the use of airwaves to an outright acquisition. Wherever they end up, a ménage-à-trois involving moguls John Malone, Brian Roberts and Masayoshi Son is likely to be ungainly. How these three got to this point is all a bit odd. For starters, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, Sprint entered into a two-month exclusive period for negotiations with Charter, controlled by Malone, and Comcast, led by the Roberts family. Sprint's shares popped 6 percent on Tuesday morning. Charter and Comcast are currently bound by an unusual pact formed in May to jointly expand their cellular ambitions. The partnership prevents either from making a material investment or acquisition in a wireless outfit without the other’s consent for a one-year period. Comcast rolled out a mobile initiative in April using Verizon’s network while Charter has similar designs. Meantime, Son, who controls Sprint though Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, has been agitating to do a deal for ages, starting by merging Sprint with T-Mobile US. They are the No. 3 and No. 4 mobile carriers in the United States, and have been locked in battle over the price-conscious clients of rivals AT&T; and Verizon. However their discussions proceed, it’s hard to imagine the three alpha executives easily coming to any agreement. Malone is known for whipping up devilishly complex structures that unusually involve a maze of tracking stocks and holding companies. Malone is trying to convince a skeptical Roberts to buy the troubled Sprint, valued at $65 billon with debt, the Journal reported.  Roberts, though, could be tempted by the cost savings a deal would bring. New Street Research reckons as much as $6 billion can be shed annually in network operating and capital expenses. Taxed at roughly 35 percent and capitalized, the present value of savings could reach nearly $40 billion.  With a potential windfall like that on the horizon, even the oldest of dogs might be convinced of a three-headed trick.

The company said that earnings in the second quarter, which ends on Friday, would fall substantially, sending its share price down 12 percent to 12.61 euros. Chief Executive Klaus Rosenfeld told analysts that a shift toward electric cars had forced Schaeffler to build many more prototype components, lifting research and development expenses while price pressures increased elsewhere.  What is new is that we were not able to compensate by lowering our production costs. This comes amid higher steel prices for certain products in the transmission area,  Rosenfeld said in a conference call on Tuesday. Herzogenaurach-based Schaeffler said it expects a 2017 adjusted operating profit (EBIT) margin of 11-12 percent, compared with previous guidance of 12-13 percent.       Fears of sector-wide margin pressure sent shares in rival suppliers Leoni (LEOGn.DE) and ElringKlinger (ZILGn.DE) down 3.5 percent and 2.4 percent respectively. Shares in Continental (CONG.DE) fell by 3.3 percent.   Schaeffler flagging increased pricing pressure will almost definitely raise concerns across the supplier space, especially with supplier valuation premium to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) at peak levels,  Jefferies analysts said in a note. Analysts at Morgan Stanley noted that Schaeffler is likely to have the highest exposure to combustion engine products such as engine systems and transmissions and therefore has  the most to do to address future industry changes for electric vehicles . Elringklinger, ZF and Continental all said they are sticking to their earnings targets. ZF said that pricing pressure is so constant that it is not a reason to change its annual forecast. Unlisted supplier Bosch said it will provide a financial update on results later in the year. Schaeffler expects growth from the autos business in the second quarter but could not say whether a hit to its profit margin was temporary or permanent. The odds that this is a lasting hit to margins or only temporary are  50-50 , Rosenfeld said.  Pricing pressure comes from the large customers,  he added, declining to name any of those customers.  It is a negotiation across the board. The fact that there is pricing pressure from the large OEMs is a reflection that they are changing their portfolios.  Schaeffler also said it had suffered a temporary supply chain shortage in the automotive spare parts business, without providing details. The company cut its forecast for 2017 free cash flow to about 500 million euros ($564 million) from about 600 million euros but stuck with a target of 4-5 percent revenue growth excluding currency effects. Rosenfeld warned in April that it would be difficult to sustain strong margins in automotive operations given rising steel prices, high R&D; costs and growing competition. Schaeffler said it now expects to report a slide in its first-half margin to about 11 percent from 12.8 percent a year earlier. It said it would publish key figures for the first six months of the year by mid-July and stuck to its 2020 profit guidance.

The shake up in an area sometimes viewed as a backwater by ambitious employees reflects a push by Italian banks to claw back bad debts that make up some 15 percent of total loans -- three times the European average. Instead of the lawyers that have traditionally dominated loan recovery, Ricci hired as his No.2 a former senior executive at Goldman Sachs' Realty Management Division. Italian banks have largely held onto loans backed by property and are now seeking to manage these assets more actively, as repossessions take years and judicial sales curtail their value.  We brought in some big guns ... but also several mid-level people from loan recovery specialists. And we moved staff with a more business-like approach from other areas of the bank to complement customary legal and technical skills,  Ricci said.  The challenge is to make everyone sing from the same hymn sheet.  Even after crises at Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca are resolved, Italy's banks will be sitting on 300 billion euros ($335 billion) of loans that soured during a harsh recession. The fragility of Italian banks, compounding chronic low growth and a huge public debt, make the country a dormant risk to euro zone stability. As the economy recovers, inflows of new problem loans have slowed to pre-crisis levels. But banks are struggling to shift impaired debts off their balance sheets, hurting their already weak profitability. Accounting rule changes and a European Central Bank review next year of assets held by small cooperative lenders could fuel fresh loan losses, warned Katia Mariotti of consultancy EY. Gross bad loan sales in Italy totalled just 15 billion euros in 2015-2016, according to the Bank of Italy. Sales Up to 70 billion euros in sales are now in the pipeline, driven by ECB-enforced clean-ups at Monte dei Paschi, Italy's fourth-largest bank, and the two Veneto lenders. Together the three are set to offload 45 billion euros in bad loans, using taxpayers' money to cover the bulk of ensuing losses. Italy's top bank UniCredit is meanwhile preparing to sell 18 billion euros of its bad loans, having already raised fresh capital to cover the hit to its balance sheet. Bank of Italy officials have publicly advised healthy lenders against selling their problem loans, however, warning that fire sales enrich only a handful of specialised buyers and risk blowing a hole in banks' capital. The ECB, which is yet to respond to bad loan reduction plans banks submitted in the spring, may see matters differently.  We don't know yet if our goals will be seen as sufficiently ambitious. It'll be a moment of reckoning when we hear back from the ECB,  one source at an Italian bank said.  If the ECB takes a hard stance it'll be hard to avoid the significant sales that the Bank of Italy is warning against.  A person familiar with the matter said the ECB, which directly supervises Italy's 13 largest banks, was analysing the heaps of data banks provided and assessing how realistic each lender's projections were. The euro zone's central bank can take measures to ensure compliance with its bad loan guidelines, which the Bank of Italy is set to adapt for the smaller banks still under its supervision. Senior supervisor Ignazio Angeloni said in May the ECB expected the guidelines to significantly speed up disposals. Cultural Shift Battling with a sluggish judicial system and patchy loan records, Italian banks on average recover in a year a sum equivalent to around 4 percent of their impaired loan stock. To boost that, some banks have struck joint ventures with collection specialists while others are bringing in fresh skills to explore ways of recouping debts while steering clear of Italian courts. But insiders say a cultural shift is required as well as an overhaul of processes that, partly because banks have not invested in technology, still rely largely on paper documents.  Italian banks will be given some time, even a year maybe, but, without selling, it will be hard for them to meet their non-performing loan reduction targets and the ECB will then be in a position to step up pressure,  said Andrea Resti, an academic who advises the European parliament on banking supervision. After writing down about 174 billion euros of debt and raising 63 billion euros via share issues since 2008, according to consultancy Prometeia, Italian banks have roughly halved the book value of their impaired loans. They value insolvent loans at less than 40 percent of their nominal value. The Bank of Italy calculates this is line with the recovery rate of 43 percent recorded by Italian banks in 2006-2015. But the average market price is around 20 percent of a loan's nominal value, meaning banks can only sell at a loss. Reuters calculations based on central bank data show that cutting Italy's gross impaired loan ratio to match UniCredit's 2019 target of 8.4 percent would require banks to raise some 19 billion euros in capital.  The market is thawing after years of paralysis but I believe that, at least over the medium term, some cash calls will be necessary if banks want to get rid of bad loans,  said Claudio Scardovi, Managing Director at AlixPartners.

Rosneft is suing Sistema for 170.6 billion roubles in damages following its purchase of oil producer Bashneft (BANE.MM) last year. Rosneft has alleged that certain assets were removed from Bashneft, while Sistema has rejected these claims as groundless. Sistema, majority owned by businessman Vladimir Evtushenkov, said earlier the court had frozen part of its 50 percent stake in telecoms company MTS (MBT.N) and its holdings in two more businesses as part of the legal dispute with Rosneft. The value of Sistema's frozen assets is 185 billion roubles  ($3.14 billion), an order issued by the arbitration court of the Russian region of Bashkortostan showed on Tuesday after the court held the first hearing in the case. Sistema said it would file an appeal. Rosneft, in which the Russian state has a controlling stake, declined to comment. The court will continue hearing the case on July 12, Russian news agencies reported. The dispute between Sistema and Rosneft has echoes of a situation in 2014 involving Sistema, when the Russian government seized Sistema's stake in Bashneft, saying Bashneft's privatization had been illegal. Sistema said on Monday that in addition to the freeze on 31.76 percent of MTS, 90.47 percent of Bashkirian Power Grid company and its wholly-owned Medsi medical clinics chain, it could not receive any income on those shares. As a result it could miss out on about 15 billion roubles in dividends from subsidiaries this year, potentially limiting its scope for acquisitions, according to analyst estimates. Shares in Sistema slumped by as much as 17 percent early on Tuesday but later pared some losses to trade about 6 percent lower by 1430 GMT.  VTB analysts estimated Sistema would only get about 8.5 billion roubles from MTS this year, down from 23 billion in 2016. Raiffeisenbank analysts put the overall dividend shortfall for Sistema at 15 billion roubles or more.  It would not hurt Sistema's ability to service its debt or fund its operational activity, but could restrict its freedom when it comes to mergers and acquisitions,  Raiffeisenbank analyst Sergey Libin said. Sistema said earlier this year that it was looking to boost its land bank as it expands in farming with a view to listing its agricultural business in the next few years.

The investment giant with oversight of $5.4 trillion in assets will buy Denver-based Cachematrix Holdings LLC in a deal slated to close next quarter, according to a statement by both companies. Terms were not disclosed. Cachematrix builds a software tool that banks can provide to corporate treasurers managing the cash and short-term debt they hold. Investments can be made in money-market funds provided by BlackRock and rival money managers, such as Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Just last week, BlackRock said it would take a stake in Scalable Capital, a European digital investment manager. The deals come two months after BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters he was considering up to four small acquisitions to shore up the New York-based company's technology and investment expertise. Fink has placed an unusual emphasis on technology for a company in his industry, including through the company's Aladdin operating system for investment management, which it licenses to rivals. The latest deal gives BlackRock a new stable of bank clients and pushes Aladdin further into the business of advising companies on how to invest their cash. In a statement, BlackRock said it plans to combine some of Cachematrix's features with Aladdin. On its website, Cachematrix lists Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and HSBC (HSBA.L) among its clients and reports assisting with $200 billion of client assets. Banks trying to meet strict requirements intended to prevent another financial crisis have been looking to shed deposits that would require them to hold more capital. Businesses have been eager to find places to put cash as ultra-easy monetary policy has pushed yields on debt to historic lows. BlackRock in 2015 expanded its reach in the business of managing large institutions' cash and short-term investments when it acquired the money-market fund business run by Bank of America.

Rosneft is suing Sistema for 170.6 billion roubles in damages following its purchase of oil producer Bashneft (BANE.MM) last year. Rosneft has alleged that certain assets were removed from Bashneft, while Sistema has rejected these claims as groundless. Sistema, majority owned by businessman Vladimir Evtushenkov, said earlier the court had frozen part of its 50 percent stake in telecoms company MTS (MBT.N) and its holdings in two more businesses as part of the legal dispute with Rosneft. The value of Sistema's frozen assets is 185 billion roubles  ($3.14 billion), an order issued by the arbitration court of the Russian region of Bashkortostan showed on Tuesday after the court held the first hearing in the case. Sistema said it would file an appeal. Rosneft, in which the Russian state has a controlling stake, declined to comment. The court will continue hearing the case on July 12, Russian news agencies reported. The dispute between Sistema and Rosneft has echoes of a situation in 2014 involving Sistema, when the Russian government seized Sistema's stake in Bashneft, saying Bashneft's privatization had been illegal. Sistema said on Monday that in addition to the freeze on 31.76 percent of MTS, 90.47 percent of Bashkirian Power Grid company and its wholly-owned Medsi medical clinics chain, it could not receive any income on those shares. As a result it could miss out on about 15 billion roubles in dividends from subsidiaries this year, potentially limiting its scope for acquisitions, according to analyst estimates. Shares in Sistema slumped by as much as 17 percent early on Tuesday but later pared some losses to trade about 6 percent lower by 1430 GMT.  VTB analysts estimated Sistema would only get about 8.5 billion roubles from MTS this year, down from 23 billion in 2016. Raiffeisenbank analysts put the overall dividend shortfall for Sistema at 15 billion roubles or more.  It would not hurt Sistema's ability to service its debt or fund its operational activity, but could restrict its freedom when it comes to mergers and acquisitions,  Raiffeisenbank analyst Sergey Libin said. Sistema said earlier this year that it was looking to boost its land bank as it expands in farming with a view to listing its agricultural business in the next few years.

But his company had signed a long-term branding and management deal with the building's developer, Talon International.

When Stehr's second and third children came along, he opened accounts for them too.  But now Stehr, a financial adviser based in the San Francisco Bay area, is now rethinking the math. His oldest two kids are in pricey private colleges and might end up in graduate school, while the youngest is eyeing the Naval Academy, which is free.   As parents consider the best way to save for college, financial advisers say the kind of accounts matter, as well as the plan to spend the money when the time comes.  One Bucket or Many?  It is a natural parental instinct to do what Stehr did: open new accounts as the kids come along. Parents like to keep things equal, and there is also something psychologically satisfying about watching each child's account grow.  Financial adviser Peter Palion of Master Plan Advisory in East Meadow, New York, says it does not matter how you slice the pie in terms of growth. The difference in compounding between three accounts with $3,000 and one account with $9,000 will be negligible if they all have the same allocations. Children who are far apart in age might have different risk tolerances along the way, though.  You might have an annual maintenance fee if you are saving in a tax-advantaged 529 college savings plan. Even at just $30 a year, it could amount to 3 percent of a $1,000 yearly contribution.  If you saved all in one account until it was time to spend the money, you could just shift the beneficiaries as needed, or open new accounts and distribute the funds, without penalty.  Most states offer a tax deduction for 529 contributions per tax return, not per account. But more accounts would be better in Virginia, where there is a deduction for contributions of up to $4,000 per account per year, says Carl Holubowich, a certified financial planner in the Washington, D.C. area.  Spending The psychology involved is especially tricky when it is time to spend down money saved for college. Saving college money for each child was so engrained in Ricardo Noceda's thinking that the idea of shifting funds from one account to the next was akin to stealing.   It's robbing Peter to pay Paul,  says Noceda, a physician from Orange County, California.  Though the money technically belonged to him, in his head all those years it was one bucket for Olivia, now 24, and one for Dylan, 22. Even when his older daughter ran short to pay for her last year of school, Noceda did not transfer money from the other account to cover the shortfall.  Kelly Bressette, a mom of three from Massachusetts, took a more pragmatic approach, after saving in separate 529 accounts for 15 years for her daughters, who are now 24, 22 and 19.   It was not easy because I needed to divide up the funds,  says Bressette. When it came to spending for the first two, she was cautious, because she was afraid of running out. Then it turned out that the youngest's tuition was far more expensive.   I decided that I would use $10,000 per year for the first child and second child, and then use $20,000 per year for the last child,  Bressette says.    Shifting funds around can often be more an issue of family dynamics than accounting, says Darin Shebesta, a financial adviser from Cave Creek, Arizona. A lot of it has to do with managing expectations, because even the kids get involved in the bucket theory - and can get attached to the notion that what is in their college fund belongs to them.  Jim Stehr will be sorting this out soon, as he decides what to do if his youngest gets a full ride. He had always told the kids that if there was money left over, they could have it.  The older two used all of their money up, but the youngest would be in for a windfall of more than six figures.   It would be a healthy chunk of change,  Stehr says.

Data showed consumer confidence for June rose more-than-expected, which could bolster the Federal Reserve's case for another rate hike this year. However, a steep fall in oil prices and a flattening yield curve have added to concerns over inflation, which remains below the Fed's 2 percent target.  The consumer remains confident and given that consumers drive two-thirds of the economy, that to me says, perhaps the news of a slowdown may be oversold,  said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial. The financial index rose 0.89 percent, leading the gainers among the major S&P; sectors, as investors expect the central bank to look through a slowdown in inflation and continue on their current path for rate hikes. Bank of America was up 1.4 percent and JPMorgan rose 0.8 percent, providing the biggest boost to the S&P.; The consumer discretionary index sector inched up 0.12 percent, with Home Depot boosting the Dow. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to take part in a discussion on global economic issues in London at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). Investors expect Yellen to offer more insight into the state of the U.S. economy.  I think at this point the Fed is more or less committed to raising rates as they're more worried about being behind the curve and reloading the gun in case of a recession,  added McMillan. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said on Tuesday the Fed rightly plans to raise rates once more this year, given recent inflation weakness is likely temporary. At 11:03 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 21.18 points, or 0.1 percent, at 21,430.73, the S&P; 500 was up 0.36 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,439.43. The Nasdaq Composite index was down 15.49 points, or 0.25 percent, at 6,231.66. The technology index fell 0.39 percent due to a drop in the shares of Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet. Alphabet fell 1 percent to $962.64 after EU antitrust regulators hit the tech giant with a record $2.7 billion fine. Since the beginning of the year, the tech index has jumped about 19 percent, making it the biggest force behind the S&P;'s record-setting rally. However, the sector has come under pressure of late over concerns about lofty valuations. Sprint rose 5.6 percent after the fourth-largest U.S. wireless service provider was said to be in talks with Charter Communications and Comcast about a wireless partnership. Comcast and Charter were down about 0.35 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,563 to 1,178. On the Nasdaq, 1,351 issues rose and 1,318 fell.

But a company known for engineering excellence is still trying to solve the very human problem of how to organize itself. Nearly two years ago, Google co-founder Larry Page announced the tech giant would be remade as Alphabet, a holding company whose units would include Google and an array of unrelated pursuits in areas such as healthcare, self-driving cars and urban planning. Wall Street cheered. Previously those riskier ventures had been lumped into Google's overall financial results. Investors would now see Google’s performance independent of its so-called “Other Bets,” an eclectic collection of 11 ventures. They include Nest, a maker of Wi-Fi enabled thermostats; Calico, which seeks to prolong the human lifespan; and X, the company's secretive research lab. Alphabet's top management also aimed to boost accountability by appointing chief executives to head each of the Other Bets. Few people in Google's constellation of ventures had ever held the title prior to that. But so far Alphabet has failed to show it can convert its Other Bets from experiments to businesses with the reach, impact and money-making potential of Google’s core search and advertising operations. Interviews with two dozen former Alphabet executives and employees reveal an organization grappling with how much time and resources Other Bets deserve in the pursuit of profitability. In the first quarter, which ended March 31, the ventures lost a combined $855 million; that's on top of a collective $3.6 billion loss for 2016. As a whole, Alphabet generated $90.3 billion in revenue in 2016. Google's share of that revenue was $89.5 billion, while its 2016 operating income was $27.9 billion. Alphabet's early days have seen more pruning than expansion of its holdings. The company has skinned back plans for Google Fiber, which delivers rapid Internet service in 10 metro areas. This month, Alphabet agreed to sell robotics company Boston Dynamics to Japanese multinational SoftBank Group Corp. It unloaded its Terra Bella satellite imaging business in February. At one point last year, it was even looking to sell Nest, the largest of the Other Bets, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Google paid an eye-popping $3.2 billion for the start-up in 2014.  (For a graphic showing Alphabet's holdings, see: tmsnrt.rs/2rNgdKN) Meanwhile, a series of executives have departed since the reorganization, including the heads of Nest, an Internet operation called Access and a venture capital firm known as GV. An Alphabet spokeswoman declined repeated requests for comment or to make executives available for interviews. Supporters of the restructuring frame the early struggles as typical growing pains. For now, Wall Street isn't worried: Alphabet's stock is near an all-time high, having reached $1,000 per share in June. Ruth Porat, the no-nonsense chief financial officer who has steered the restructuring, has won rave reviews from investors for enforcing financial accountability across Alphabet. Some Other Bets have made notable strides. Life sciences initiative Verily recently attracted $800 million in outside investment. Self-driving car project Waymo is considered among the leaders in the burgeoning industry. Still, it's not yet clear the structure will enable Alphabet to do what most companies cannot: conceive the next wave of innovation in-house or through the development of key acquisitions. That goal is central to both the company's mission and investor expectations, analysts say. “The reason Google gets to trade at a decent multiple… is because there's a growth story beyond advertising,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. CEO or COO? The Alphabet structure is Google’s stab at an age-old corporate conundrum: sustaining innovation within a giant enterprise. Alphabet's strategy is to give entrepreneurs the autonomy of a startup, coupled with the discipline of a traditional corporate structure. Roughly once a quarter, Other Bets leaders meet with the Alphabet board – comprised of Porat, Page, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and David Drummond, Alphabet's senior vice president of corporate development – to discuss funding and performance, according to two former employees. At the same time, Alphabet is establishing separate compensation plans for the Other Bets to reward employees if their ventures succeed, mirroring startup incentives. Attendees wait for a Google presentation in San Francisco, October 2016.Beck DiefenbachThe formula has primed Alphabet's emerging businesses for  global impact,  Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said this month at the annual stockholders meeting at the Mountain View headquarters.  There is one solution that we know works well in capitalism, which is boards, shareholders, CEOs,  Schmidt said.  My bet is that the traditional lessons of business organization will in fact result in success at Alphabet.  Still, Alphabet top brass continue to hold sway over key strategy and financing decisions, a dynamic that has chafed Other Bets chief executives who've complained they are treated more like chief operating officers than shot callers, according to people familiar with the situation. In addition, scrutiny from Wall Street limits how generous Alphabet can be in extending Google's resources to Other Bets, said Brian McClendon, a former vice president of engineering at Google.  As of yet, the restructuring hasn’t provided what I think is one of the immediate benefits, which is risk-taking investment,  he said. Nickeled and Dimed Some companies acquired by Google found that being part of Alphabet wasn't what they'd bargained for. Two former Nest employees said they were promised generous funding and time to achieve profitability following the company's acquisition by Google in 2014. But after the restructuring, Alphabet executives were keenly focused on revenue, one former employee said. Pricey overhead has made the path to profitability tougher. After the restructuring, Alphabet began charging Other Bets for their portion of shared services such as security and facilities, ending what had previously amounted to a subsidy, people familiar with the situation said. The units also felt pressure to maintain Google perks such as free employee meals.  “One of the pitfalls (of Alphabet) is that those companies are asked to stand on their own two feet, but they may inherit the cost structure of Google,  said Nest investor Peter Nieh, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. In early 2016, Alphabet explored selling Nest in an effort code-named Project Amalfi, according to three people familiar with the matter. No deal materialized, and Nest co-founder Tony Fadell departed last year. Fadell declined to comment. Boston Dynamics, acquired in 2013 during a robotics shopping spree led by Android creator Andy Rubin, enjoyed generous funding at first. But it was adrift after Rubin's departure, two former employees said. Rubin did not respond to requests for comment. Grumpy Googlers The creation of the Other Bets has also changed what it means to work for Google. Some grumble that their role now is to subsidize innovation at their sister companies, rather than to innovate themselves. “It did sort of send the message to people who stayed back at Google, whether in search or in ads: Your job isn’t to push the envelope,” one former Googler said. Employee transfers to X, the illustrious “moonshot factory,” are more complicated now that it's a separate entity, former employees say. That’s a striking shift, especially for high-performing employees accustomed to moving about the company almost at will, said Punit Soni, a former Google employee who is now chief executive of Learning Motors, an artificial intelligence startup. “A basic premise of Google was people could do whatever they wanted,” Soni said. “I can see why people will feel like it’s no longer the old Google.  In the meantime, co-founder Page is pursuing yet another  moonshot : flying cars.  He is the primary investor in Kitty Hawk, a startup in the field that is entirely outside the Alphabet umbrella.

The company said that earnings in the second quarter, which ends on Friday, would fall substantially, sending its share price down 12 percent to 12.61 euros. Chief Executive Klaus Rosenfeld told analysts that a shift toward electric cars had forced Schaeffler to build many more prototype components, lifting research and development expenses while price pressures increased elsewhere.  What is new is that we were not able to compensate by lowering our production costs. This comes amid higher steel prices for certain products in the transmission area,  Rosenfeld said in a conference call on Tuesday. Herzogenaurach-based Schaeffler said it expects a 2017 adjusted operating profit (EBIT) margin of 11-12 percent, compared with previous guidance of 12-13 percent.       Fears of sector-wide margin pressure sent shares in rival suppliers Leoni (LEOGn.DE) and ElringKlinger (ZILGn.DE) down 3.5 percent and 2.4 percent respectively. Shares in Continental (CONG.DE) fell by 3.3 percent.   Schaeffler flagging increased pricing pressure will almost definitely raise concerns across the supplier space, especially with supplier valuation premium to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) at peak levels,  Jefferies analysts said in a note. Analysts at Morgan Stanley noted that Schaeffler is likely to have the highest exposure to combustion engine products such as engine systems and transmissions and therefore has  the most to do to address future industry changes for electric vehicles . Elringklinger, ZF and Continental all said they are sticking to their earnings targets. ZF said that pricing pressure is so constant that it is not a reason to change its annual forecast. Unlisted supplier Bosch said it will provide a financial update on results later in the year. Schaeffler expects growth from the autos business in the second quarter but could not say whether a hit to its profit margin was temporary or permanent. The odds that this is a lasting hit to margins or only temporary are  50-50 , Rosenfeld said.  Pricing pressure comes from the large customers,  he added, declining to name any of those customers.  It is a negotiation across the board. The fact that there is pricing pressure from the large OEMs is a reflection that they are changing their portfolios.  Schaeffler also said it had suffered a temporary supply chain shortage in the automotive spare parts business, without providing details. The company cut its forecast for 2017 free cash flow to about 500 million euros ($564 million) from about 600 million euros but stuck with a target of 4-5 percent revenue growth excluding currency effects. Rosenfeld warned in April that it would be difficult to sustain strong margins in automotive operations given rising steel prices, high R&D; costs and growing competition. Schaeffler said it now expects to report a slide in its first-half margin to about 11 percent from 12.8 percent a year earlier. It said it would publish key figures for the first six months of the year by mid-July and stuck to its 2020 profit guidance.

The World Anti-Doping Agency, in announcing the change on Tuesday, said it was satisfied RUSADA had met four key demands. RUSADA has been authorized to run tests, using its trained doping control officers (DCOs), under the supervision of WADA-appointed international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD), WADA said in a statement on its official website. RUSADA was stripped of its WADA accreditation after a report published in November 2015 accused it of systematically violating anti-doping regulations. WADA said in May that Russia would remain an outcast until four key demands were met, chief among them the removal of twice Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva from her position as head of RUSADA's supervisory council and her replacement with an independent chair and vice-chair. WADA said on Tuesday it was now satisfied with RUSADA's fulfillment of the four demands, which included drug testers being allowed access to closed cities where it said athletes continued to evade testing, access to athletes' biological passports, and the implementation of a conflict of interest policy. WADA President Craig Reedie said this represented a milestone toward RUSADA's retrieval of its accreditation although  there is still more to be done.   After much work by the Agency and its partners, resumption of testing represents an important step forward in rebuilding anti-doping in Russia,  Reedie said in a statement.   We strongly encourage Russia to continue their efforts in the interest of clean athletes worldwide.  Important Step Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko welcomed WADA's decision as a  very important step  toward RUSADA becoming compliant.   We are striving to create a strong, independent anti-doping agency which, I hope, will win the respect and recognition of its colleagues,  R-Sport news agency quoted Mutko as saying. Isinbayeva stepped down from her position as chair of RUSADA's supervisory council last month, although she still remains a member.  Isinbayeva's appointment last December had infuriated WADA because she was a virulent critic of the decision by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to ban Russian track and field athletes from international competition. A majority of Russian athletes are set to miss the world championships in London in August if the ban is not overturned. Fifteen athletes, including 2015 world champion hurdler Sergey Shubenkov, have so far been cleared by the IAAF to compete as neutrals in international competitions after having demonstrated they have been training in an environment that fulfils the necessary anti-doping requirements.

The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) focuses on maintaining currency and price stability but Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, head of the watchdog, recommended last week that it should act in the interests of empowering citizens by promoting growth. The proposal comes as South Africa's economy has sunk into recession, its credit rating was downgraded and politics is gripped by questions over President Jacob Zuma's stewardship. Mkhwebane said the current mandate was focused on a  few commercial interests . The bank immediately rejected that, saying Mkhwebane's office had no business in making recommendations about how it is run. South Africa's central bank has raised interest rates by a cumulative 200 basis points since 2014 to containing rising inflation, hitting consumers who rely on cheap lending to make ends meet. South Africa's unemployment is at a 14-year high, and key sectors of the economy, such as trade and manufacturing, are struggling as the country reels in recession. Governor Lesetja Kganyago said in court filings that Mkhwebane's proposal would undermine SARB's role in keeping the financial system stable, hence it must be set aside. Kganyago said the public protector had no power to instruct parliament to amend the constitution.  From the moment it (the recommendation) was announced, it has had a serious and detrimental effect on the economy and for as long as it remains in place, it holds the risk of causing further rand depreciation, further ratings downgrades and significant capital outflows,  Kganyago said.  This gross overreach ... must be stopped in its tracks so that certainty and predictability about the Reserve Bank's role in our constitution democracy is affirmed.  Parliament also plans to mount a legal challenge to the proposal. The row over the central bank's role has also highlighted divisions in the tripartite political alliance of the ruling African National Congress party (ANC), the country's biggest union, Cosatu, and the South African Communist Party (SACP). Both the ANC and the SACP are opposed to altering the role of the central bank while Cosatu has backed calls for changes. South Africa's Deputy Finance Minister Sfiso Buthelezi said on Monday Treasury was yet to take a view on the proposal. Buthelezi, however, said the debate on whether it was necessary to change the central bank's inflation target range of 3 to 6 percent was welcome.  Perhaps it's a good (inflation targeting) band, but we set this 3 to 6 percent under different economic conditions, is it still relevant now?  Buthelezi said.

Oil prices have tumbled in recent weeks despite moves by Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last month to quell a global supply glut brought on in part by resurgent U.S. shale output.  I personally believe (the oil price) where we are right now is not sustainable. It comes in the form of two words: Saudi Arabia. They cannot have a scenario, which is $43 or $44 (per barrel) oil, and sustain their national budgets,  Tim Dove, Pioneer's CEO, said at the JPMorgan Energy Equity Investor Conference in New York. Despite the supply glut, Pioneer has no plans to stop drilling new wells, Dove said.   We're not going to not drill, because this very well may be the time where the well costs are as low as they're ever going to be,  he said. Pioneer, one of the largest oil producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, has hedged most of its 2017 oil production but has not been about to hedge more than roughly a third of is 2018 output since OPEC's meeting last month, Dove said.  We can pare away and still be profitable even in a $45 (per barrel) environment,  he said.  We may just dial back at the margin in that scenario and not be a significant over-spender.

Fitch also downgraded Vicenza's Viability Rating (VR) to 'f' from 'cc'. The Rating Watch on Vicenza's senior debt has been revised to Positive (RWP) from RWE. Fitch has also affirmed Intesa Sanpaolo's (IntesaSP) IDRs and VR at 'BBB'/'F2' and 'bbb' respectively. The Outlook on Intesa is Stable. At the same time Fitch has affirmed Veneto Banca's state-guaranteed notes at 'BBB'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The rating action follows the announcement that Vicenza and Veneto Banca were placed into liquidation after the Italian government passed a law decree (n.99, 25 June 2017) on Sunday. On 23 June, the European Central Bank determined that the banks were 'failing or likely to fail' as a result of lack of capital and, on the same date, the Single Resolution Board concluded that a resolution action was not necessary in the public interest, so that normal Italian insolvency proceedings would achieve the resolution objectives. The decree includes the sale of certain bank assets and liabilities to IntesaSP. These assets include performing loans, financial assets, tax assets, customer deposits, senior bonds (including state-guaranteed notes), assets under management and administration, branches and staff as well as certain subsidiaries. IntesaSP has not acquired the two banks' equity and subordinated debt as well as claims, litigations, non-performing exposures and other subsidiaries and shareholdings. The terms of the transaction allow IntesaSP to return the assets and liabilities to the two banks if the government decree is not converted into law, which requires a vote in both chambers of the Italian government within 60 days of the government decree being promulgated, or if the final law results in an increased cost to IntesaSP. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT Vicenza The downgrade of Vicenza's Long- and Short-Term IDRs to 'D' and of the VR to 'f' reflects that the bank has been placed into liquidation. The RWP on Vicenza's senior unsecured bonds reflects Fitch's expectation that these will be upgraded to the same level as IntesaSP's senior debt once the government decree has been converted into law, which will make the transfer of senior debt to IntesaSP final. IntesaSP The affirmation of the ratings reflects our opinion that the transaction does not affect the VR of the bank. We believe that the transaction is neutral to the bank's risk appetite, capitalisation and asset quality. IntesaSP receives a cash contribution from the Italian government to cover the impact of the asset transfer on its capital ratios, which will allow the bank to maintain a transitional CET1 ratio of 12.5%. The cash contribution will also cover integration and rationalisation costs related to the acquisition. In addition, the government will guarantee against potential risks, obligations and claims on IntesaSP related to events prior to the sale. Vicenza's and Veneto's non-performing exposures will remain in the banks that have been placed under liquidation. IntesaSP has the right to return up to EUR4 billion high-risk performing loans to the banks in liquidation by 31 December 2020 if these loans become impaired. In total, IntesaSP will receive EUR4.875 billion in cash from the Italian government and EUR1.5 billion as public guarantees against potential legal risks. IntesaSP's ratings continue to reflect the bank's diversified and stable business model, combined with a leading domestic franchise in various market segments, which will become stronger in North-Eastern Italy following the transfer of Vicenza's and Veneto Banca's selected activities. IntesaSP's company profile has helped the group generate profitability that has remained above domestic peers' in a challenging operating environment. The bank's sound execution track record has enabled IntesaSP to generate consistent profitability through the economic cycle, which differentiates the bank from its domestic peers. The ratings further reflect Fitch's view of the group's resilient capitalisation and robust funding structure, but also the group's asset quality, which remains weak compared with international peers, and a high level of unreserved impaired loans, which weighs on capitalisation. IntesaSP's Short-Term IDR of 'F2' is the higher of the two possibilities for a 'BBB' Long-Term IDR under our criteria, reflecting that the bank's short-term liquidity profile is supported by ready access to central bank facilities given the ECB's accommodative policy. The ratings of the senior debt issued by IntesaSP's funding vehicles, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Ireland, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Luxembourg, S.A. and Intesa Funding LLC, are equalised with that of the parent because the debt is unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by IntesaSP and Fitch expects the parent to honour this guarantee. DCR IntesaSP IntesaSP's DCR is at the same level as the bank's Long-Term IDRs because in Italy derivative counterparties have no preferential legal status over other senior obligations in a resolution scenario. SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF) Vicenza, IntesaSP Despite Vicenza's senior creditors suffering no losses as a result of the regulatory action, the SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that although external support is possible it cannot be relied upon. Senior creditors can no longer expect to receive full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that the bank becomes non-viable. The EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) for eurozone banks provide a framework for the resolution of banks that requires senior creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of a bank receiving sovereign support. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Vicenza, IntesaSP The subordinated Tier 2 debt issued by Vicenza is downgraded to 'C'/Recovery Rating 'RR6' to reflect poor recovery prospects for the subordinated bondholders that remain in the bank that is being liquidated. The Italian state will become a senior creditor of the liquidated bank, which means that recovery prospects for junior creditors out of the liquidation are poor. Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital securities issued by IntesaSP are notched down from the VR in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles. Tier 2 subordinated debt is rated one notch below the VR for loss severity to reflect below-average recovery prospects. No notching is applied for incremental non-performance risk because write-down of the notes will only occur once the point of non-viability is reached and there is no coupon flexibility before non-viability. The legacy Upper Tier 2 debt rating reflects its higher loss severity given its subordination to senior unsecured and subordinated Tier 2 obligations (two notches) and incremental non-performance risk (one notch) for its cumulative coupon deferral subject to constraints. Legacy Tier 1 notes are notched down four times from the VR, two notches for loss severity for deep subordination and another two for non-performance risk as coupon deferral is constrained by look-back clauses. Additional Tier 1 notes are rated five notches below the VR, two notches for loss severity relative to senior unsecured creditors and three notches for incremental non-performance risk, the latter notching reflecting the instruments' fully discretionary interest payment. SENIOR STATE-GUARANTEED SECURITIES Vicenza, Veneto Banca The long-term rating of the state-guaranteed debt is based on Italy's direct, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the issues, which covers payments of both principal and interest. Italy's guarantee was issued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance under Law Decree 23 December 2016, n. 237, subsequently converted into law 15/2017. The ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that Italy will honour the guarantee provided to the noteholders in a full and timely manner. The state guarantee ranks pari passu with Italy's other unsecured and unguaranteed senior obligations. As a result, the notes' long-term ratings are in line with Italy's 'BBB' Long-Term IDR. Under the decree, the notes are being transferred to IntesaSP. IntesaSP will have the right to cancel the guarantee. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT Vicenza Fitch expects to withdraw Vicenza's IDRs and VR once the decree is converted into law without material amendments and the sale is formally completed in line with original expectations. Fitch expects to simultaneously upgrade Vicenza's senior unsecured debt that has been transferred to IntesaSP to 'BBB', in line with IntesaSP's senior debt rating. If the decree is not converted into law or if the transaction does not proceed as planned, which Fitch currently does not expect, the senior debt would likely be downgraded as losses to senior creditors would become more likely. IntesaSP IntesaSP's ratings could be downgraded if the bank does not meet its impaired loan reduction targets and its capital remains highly exposed to unreserved impaired loans. Similarly, deterioration in the bank's funding and liquidity would put pressure on the ratings, as would prioritising dividend distribution over capital retention in case of need. IntesaSP's ratings remain sensitive to deterioration in the operating environment in Italy and to Italy's sovereign ratings. Its Short-Term IDR would be downgraded if the bank is unable to successfully manage the tapered ECB asset buying programme and replace central bank funding with market funding. An upgrade of the ratings would require a significant improvement of the bank's asset quality and, given the bank's overwhelmingly domestic operations, an upgrade of Italy's sovereign rating. The ratings of the senior debt issued by Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Ireland, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Luxembourg, S.A. and Intesa Funding LLC are sensitive to the same considerations that affect the senior unsecured debt issued by the parent. DCR IntesaSP The DCR is sensitive to changes to IntesaSP's Long-Term IDR. SR AND SRF IntesaSP, Vicenza An upgrade of the SR and any upward revision of the SRF would be contingent on a positive change in the sovereign's propensity to support Italian banks. While not impossible, this is highly unlikely, in Fitch's view. We expect to withdraw Vicenza's SR and SRF once the other issuer ratings are withdrawn. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES IntesaSP, Vicenza IntesaSP's subordinated debt and hybrid securities' ratings are primarily sensitive to changes in the VR, from which they are notched. The ratings are also sensitive to a change in the notes' notching, which could arise if Fitch changes its assessment of their non-performance relative to the risk captured in the VRs or their expected loss severity. For Additional Tier 1 issues this could reflect a change in capital management or flexibility, or an unexpected shift in regulatory buffers and requirements, for example. We expect to withdraw Vicenza's subordinated debt once we withdraw the bank's other ratings. SENIOR STATE-GUARANTEED SECURITIES Vicenza,Veneto Banca The notes' ratings are sensitive to changes in Italy's Long-Term IDR. If IntesaSP decides to cancel the guarantees on this senior debt, Fitch will no longer rate the notes based on the guarantee but might assign ratings based on IntesaSP's senior debt rating. The rating actions are as follows: Vicenza Long-Term IDR: downgraded to 'D' from at 'CCC'/RWE Short-Term IDR: downgraded to 'D' from 'C'/RWE Viability Rating: downgraded to 'f' from 'cc' Support Rating: affirmed at '5' Support Rating Floor: affirmed at 'No Floor' Long-term senior unsecured notes and EMTN programme: 'CCC'/'RR4' placed on RWP from RWE Short-term rating on EMTN programme: 'C' placed on RWP from RWE Subordinated debt: downgraded to 'C'/'RR6' from 'CC'/'RR5' State-guaranteed debt: affirmed at 'BBB' Veneto Banca State-guaranteed debt: affirmed at 'BBB' IntesaSP Long-Term IDR: affirmed at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable Short-Term IDR: affirmed at 'F2' Viability Rating: affirmed at 'bbb' Support Rating: affirmed at '5' Support Rating Floor: affirmed at 'No Floor' DCR: affirmed at 'BBB (dcr)' Senior debt (including debt issuance programmes): affirmed at 'BBB'/'F2' Commercial paper/certificate of deposit programmes: affirmed at 'F2' Short-term deposits: affirmed at 'F2' Senior market-linked notes: affirmed at 'BBBemr' Subordinated Tier II debt: affirmed at 'BBB-' Subordinated upper Tier II debt: affirmed at 'BB' Tier 1 instruments: affirmed at 'BB-' AT1 notes: affirmed at 'B+' Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Ireland plc Commercial paper/short-term debt affirmed at 'F2' Senior unsecured debt: affirmed at 'BBB' Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Luxembourg, S.A.

At 10:48 a.m. ET (1448 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index was up 26.17 points, or 0.17 percent, at 15,342.19. Four of the index's 10 main groups advanced. Energy stocks led with a 1.1 percent rise, as oil prices extended gains. U.S. crude rallied 2.2 percent to $44.32 a barrel. Cenovus Energy rose 2.8 percent to C$9.41. The heavily weighted financials group added 0.3 percent, as modest advances by some of Canada's largest banks led the index higher. On the down side, the technology group was among the most influential index movers, retreating 0.8 percent. The moves tracked a sell-off in U.S. tech shares, which had come under recent pressure over lofty valuations, and were also hit by a drop in Alphabet Inc stock following news that European Union antitrust regulators had hit the tech giant with a record $2.7 billion fine.

Oil prices have tumbled in recent weeks despite moves by Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last month to quell a global supply glut brought on in part by resurgent U.S. shale output.  I personally believe (the oil price) where we are right now is not sustainable. It comes in the form of two words: Saudi Arabia. They cannot have a scenario, which is $43 or $44 (per barrel) oil, and sustain their national budgets,  Tim Dove, Pioneer's CEO, said at the JPMorgan Energy Equity Investor Conference in New York. Despite the supply glut, Pioneer has no plans to stop drilling new wells, Dove said.   We're not going to not drill, because this very well may be the time where the well costs are as low as they're ever going to be,  he said. Pioneer, one of the largest oil producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, has hedged most of its 2017 oil production but has not been about to hedge more than roughly a third of is 2018 output since OPEC's meeting last month, Dove said.  We can pare away and still be profitable even in a $45 (per barrel) environment,  he said.  We may just dial back at the margin in that scenario and not be a significant over-spender.

Speaking to a conference in Portugal, ECB President Mario Draghi said the ECB could adjust its policy tools of sub-zero interest rates and massive bond purchases as economic prospects improve in Europe. But any change in the bank's stance should be gradual, as  considerable  monetary support is still needed and the rebound in inflation will also depend on favorable global financing conditions, he added. The euro's gains briefly elevated it more than 1 percent against the greenback to $1.1304 in the U.S. morning session, marking its strongest level since Sept. 8, 2016.  Just the fact that the ECB is considering their options right now is considered to be a hawkish signal,  said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York. The status of the ECB's bond-buying program has been a key driver of the euro's value in recent weeks. The dollar jumped against the euro earlier this month after the central bank said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying program. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.7 percent at 96.783 after touching a 13-day low of 96.649 earlier in morning trading. The dollar's weakness was exacerbated after a survey showing weaker-than-expected U.S. home price acceleration in April. Recent data on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation have given pause and housing data has been mixed. Traders were awaiting comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT), when she is scheduled to take part in a discussion on global economic issues in London. Traders expect Yellen to maintain her positive outlook on the U.S. economy despite the recent weak data, reinforcing the central bank's plan to raise rates once more this year and three times next year. The dollar  could be in line to rebound  on Yellen's comments, said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington, in a research note. The dollar hit a more than one-month high against the yen, of 112.15 yen. Manimbo said traders who are bearish on the yen have the most faith in the Fed raising rates again this year.

Residents in Tajoura district said the bodies had begun washing up at the end of last week. Several had been partially devoured by stray dogs, according to a local coast guard official. The toll was expected to increase as the flimsy boats used to carry migrants as far as international waters normally carry more than 100 people. Three migrants died in the Mediterranean on Monday night, a German aid group said, during Italian-led rescue operations in which thousands more were pulled to safety. About 5,000 migrants were picked up off the Libyan coast by emergency services, Italy's navy, aid groups and private boats on Monday, and rescues were continuing on Tuesday, according to an Italian coastguard spokesman.  Despite all efforts, three people died from a sinking rubber boat  and rescue boats in the area are struggling to cope, German humanitarian group Jugend Rettet said on Facebook. Jugend Rettet (Rescuing Youth) is one of about nine aid groups patrolling seas into which people traffickers have sent more than half a million refugees and migrants on highly dangerous voyages towards Europe over the past four years.  Rescuers carry a bag containing the dead body of a migrant at the coast of Tajoura, east of Tripoli, Libya, June 27, 2017.Ismail Zitouny We reached the capacity limit of our ship, while our crew is seeing more boats on the horizon. Currently, all vessels are overloaded,  Jugend Rettet added.  The total number of migrants reaching Europe by sea so far this year is less than half that counted in the same period of 2016, thanks to a deal between the EU and Turkey which blocked a once-busy route to Greece. But the number coming to Italy has risen.   Rescuers carry a bag containing the dead body of a migrant at the coast of Tajoura, east of Tripoli, Libya, June 27, 2017.Ismail ZitounyAbout 72,000 migrants arrived in Italy on the perilous route from Libya between Jan. 1 and June 21, roughly 20 percent more than in 2016, and more than 2,000 died on the way, according to the International Organization for Migration.  Criminal gangs have taken advantage of widespread lawlessness in Libya to establish profitable businesses, cramming mainly sub-Saharan African and Bangladeshi migrants into flimsy rubber boats. The Spanish naval ship Victoria, deployed in the European Union's Mediterranean mission, went to the aid of six boats and took on migrants from rescue vessels that were already full to capacity, Spain's defense ministry said. The Victoria then headed to the southern Italian island of Lampedusa with 907 migrants on board, one of whom was in critical condition, a ministry statement said.    Italy and the EU are trying to work with Libyan authorities to fight smugglers, but the same chaos which allowed the gangs to flourish is hampering official efforts.

At an event hosted by women's magazine  Brigitte  on Monday evening, Merkel said she had taken note of other German parties favoring same-sex marriage and would allow a free vote.  I would like to lead the discussion more into a situation where it is a question of conscience rather than something I push through with a majority vote,  she said. The move could antagonize some in her traditionally Catholic conservative bloc, some of whom oppose any change. Merkel has previously argued against same-sex marriage.  SPD leader Martin Schulz said on Tuesday his party would push for a vote in parliament this week, before the start of the summer recess.  I hope our colleagues in the conservatives will cooperate,  he said, raising the pressure on his conservative partners - who want a vote after the election. Schulz needs to make up ground for his center-left party in the election race and has sharpened his attacks on Merkel, but he made clear he would not end the coalition. Merkel's conservatives accused him of acting irresponsibly.  That is a breach of trust,  said Volker Kauder, head of Merkel's conservative bloc in parliament, adding the SPD's behavior on such a sensitive topic showed it was  not suited to government .   With broad support among Germans for gay marriage, the law would likely get easy approval in the lower house of parliament if conservatives could vote according to their conscience and not face a party whip.  Polls put Merkel's conservatives 10-15 points ahead of the SPD, but short of a parliamentary majority.  The SPD, pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens have made gay marriage, a step up from same-sex civil partnerships which have been allowed since 2001, a condition for a tie-up. The LSVD association representing gays welcomed Merkel's shift while describing it as a face-saving measure.   After 15 years of an ideological blockade .. social pressure and the commitments of other parties have made an impact,  said LSVD spokesman Axel Hochrein.  Equal rights for all people is part of our constitution,  he said.

The stay had initially only protected 114 detainees from the Detroit area. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith sided with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union who filed an amended complaint on Saturday seeking to prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from deporting Iraqis from anywhere in the United States.  The ACLU argued those being deported could face persecution, torture, or death because many were Chaldean Catholics, Sunni Muslims, or Iraqi Kurds and that the groups were recognized as targets of ill-treatment in Iraq. Goldsmith agreed with the ACLU on the grave consequences deportees may face, writing in his seven-page opinion and order that:  Such harm far outweighs any interest the Government may have in proceeding with the removals immediately.  On Thursday, Goldsmith ordered a stay in the Michigan Iraqis' deportation for at least two weeks while he decided whether he had jurisdiction over the merits of deporting immigrants who could face physical danger in their countries of origin. He expanded his stay on Monday to the broader class of Iraqi nationals nationwide, saying it applies to the removal of all Iraqi nationals in the United States with final orders of removal who have been or will be detained by ICE. There are 1,444 Iraqi nationals who have final deportation orders against them, although only 199 of them were detained as part of a nationwide sweep by immigration authorities, federal prosecutors said in court on Monday. Those detained had convictions for serious crimes, including rape and kidnapping, ICE said. Goldsmith also said his stays were designed to give detainees time to find legal representation to appeal against their deportation orders, and to give him time to weigh the question of his jurisdiction. Daniel Lemisch, acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, called the opinion  highly extraordinary.   But it's a very extraordinary circumstance because of the on-the-ground situation in Iraq,  Lemisch said by phone, referring to the danger faced by possible deportees.  ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt praised the ruling for saying that  the lives of these individuals should not depend on what part of the United States they reside and whether they could find a lawyer to file a federal court action.  Goldsmith's order came the same day the U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory to President Donald Trump by reviving parts of a travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries. The roundup in Michigan followed Iraq's agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from Trump's revised temporary travel ban. Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago, but they had been allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them. That changed after the two governments came to the agreement in March. Reporting by Steve Friess in Detroit; Editing by Eric M.

The justices narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had completely blocked key parts of a March 6 executive order that Trump had said was needed to prevent terrorism attacks, allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the United States. [tmsnrt.rs/2seb3bb] The court issued its order on the last day of its current term and agreed to hear oral arguments during its next term starting in October so it can decide finally whether the ban is lawful in a major test of presidential powers. In a statement, Trump called the high court's action  a clear victory for our national security,  saying the justices allowed the travel suspension to become largely effective.  As president, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm. I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive,  Trump added. Trump's March 6 order called for a blanket 90-day ban on people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees while the government implemented stronger vetting procedures. The court allowed a limited version of the refugee ban, which had also been blocked by courts, to go into effect. Trump issued the order amid rising international concern about attacks carried out by Islamist militants like those in Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin and other cities. But challengers said no one from the affected countries had carried out attacks in the United States. Federal courts said the travel ban violated federal immigration law and was discriminatory against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution. Critics called it a discriminatory  Muslim ban.  Related CoverageU.S. judge halts deportation of Iraqis nationwideAhmed al-Nasi, an official in Yemen’s Ministry of Expatriate Affairs, voiced disappointment.  We believe it will not help in confronting terrorism and extremism, but rather will increase the feeling among the nationals of these countries that they are all being targeted, especially given that Yemen is an active partner of the United States in the war on terrorism and that there are joint operations against terrorist elements in Yemen,  he said. Groups that challenged the ban, including the American Civil Liberties Union, said that most people from the affected countries seeking entry to the United States would have the required connections. But they voiced concern the administration would interpret the ban as broadly as it could.  It's going to be very important for us over this intervening period to make sure the government abides by the terms of the order and does not try to use it as a back door into implementing the full-scale Muslim ban that it's been seeking to implement,  said Omar Jadwat, an ACLU lawyer. During the 2016 presidential race, Trump campaigned for  a total and complete shutdown  of Muslims entering the United States. The travel ban was a signature policy of Trump's first few months as president.  A family embraces each other as members arrive at Washington Dulles International Airport after the U.S. Supreme Court granted parts of the Trump administration's emergency request to put its travel ban into effect later in the week pending judicial review in the autumn, in Dulles, Virginia, U.S., June 26, 2017.James Lawler Duggan'Bona Fide Relationship' In an unusual unsigned decision, the Supreme Court on Monday said the travel ban will go into effect  with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.   A lack of a clearly defined relationship would bar from entry people from the six countries and refugees with no such ties. Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin, who successfully challenged the ban in lower courts, said that students from affected countries due to attend the University of Hawaii would still be able to do so. Slideshow (10 Images)Both bans were to partly go into effect 72 hours after the court's decision. The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department pledged to implement the decision in an orderly fashion.  We will keep those traveling to the United States and partners in the travel industry informed as we implement the order in a professional, organized, and timely way,  a State Department spokeswoman said. Trump signed the order as a replacement for a Jan. 27 one issued a week after he became president that also was blocked by federal courts, but not before it caused chaos at airports and provoked numerous protests. Even before the Supreme Court action the ban applied only to new visa applicants, not people who already have visas or are U.S. permanent residents, known as green card holders. The executive order also made waivers available for a foreign national seeking to enter the United States to resume work or study, visit a spouse, child or parent who is a U.S. citizen, or for  significant business or professional obligations.  Refugees  in transit  and already approved would have been able to travel to the United States under the executive order. A Conservative Court The case was Trump's first major challenge at the Supreme Court, where he restored a 5-4 conservative majority with the appointment of Neil Gorsuch, who joined the bench in April. There are five Republican appointees on the court and four Democratic appointees. The four liberal justices were silent. Gorsuch was one of the three conservative justices who would have granted Trump's request to put the order completely into effect. Fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he warned that requiring officials to differentiate between foreigners who have a connection to the United States and those who do not will prove unworkable.   Today's compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding - on peril of contempt - whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,  Thomas wrote. The state of Hawaii and a group of plaintiffs in Maryland represented by the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the order violated federal immigration law and the Constitution's First Amendment prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. Regional federal appeals courts in Virginia and California both upheld district judge injunctions blocking the order. Reporting by Lawrence Hurley.

The comments from Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, a centrist U.S. rate-setter, reinforce the central bank's wait-and-see approach to two months of surprisingly soft price readings which have brought its preferred inflation measure down to 1.5 percent.  I'm sticking to my outlook that we're on the right path,  Harker told the European Economics and Financial Centre in London, according to prepared remarks.  In the case of inflation, I've seen the factors exerting downward pressure as temporary.  Yet Harker, who votes on the Fed's monetary policy committee this year under a rotation, hedged somewhat by delaying to early 2018 the time frame in which he expects inflation to rebound to a 2-percent target. He had previously penciled in the end of 2017. The Fed has raised rates three times since December in a nod to unemployment having fallen last month to its lowest level in 16 years. Overall Fed forecasts predict another rate hike this year, and they see inflation hitting target by the end of 2018.  I still support the continued gradual removal of accommodation,  Harker said.  I still see another rate hike as appropriate for 2017.

The longer the crisis around Qatar continues, the deeper and stronger the lines of conflict will become,  Gabriel told reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.   We hope that there soon can be direct discussion among all those involved because a further escalation will serve no one.  Gabriel said a 2015 agreement in which major powers lifted international sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program had helped avert military conflict. U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the deal, but Gabriel said Germany and Europe would resist any efforts to cancel it. He said Iran and Germany remained  worlds apart  on Israel's right to exist, which he called  non-negotiable , but that he and Zarif had open discussions about that issue and many others. Gabriel said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was trying to make Iran more attractive to foreign investors as part of a broad effort to improve the lives of the Iranian people. But he said Iran could also improve its standing by helping to reduce tensions in the region. Zarif said Iran was interested in working toward a political solution to the conflict with Qatar - which, unlike its Gulf neighbors, maintains good relations with Tehran - arguing that  pressure and sanctions and blockades  were not the answer. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of support for Islamist militants, an allegation Qatar denies. They have since issued 13 demands including closing Al Jazeera television, curbing relations with Iran, shutting a Turkish base and paying reparations. Gabriel said he viewed the Arab list as the  starting point of negotiations, not the end . Zarif also invited Gabriel to visit Iran amid a push by both countries to expand business and trade ties. He said the German finance and economics ministers had pledged during his meetings in Berlin to use all means to strengthen trade.

The recommendation from the National Consultative Committee on Ethics (CCNE) comes two months after President Emmanuel Macron promised to legislate on access to medically assisted procreation for lesbians if elected. The all-clear from CCNE, a panel which deliberates on sweeping societal changes made possible by the progress of science, brings France a step closer to the biggest gay rights reform since same-sex marriage was legalized in 2013. A group that spearheaded months of protests before the legalizsation of gay marriage denounced the view of the ethics committee. It urged Macron in a statement not to launch what it said would be a  futile  debate on the issue. It cited a poll by Opinionay survey which found earlier this month that 77 percent of respondents answered  yes  when asked if they felt the state should guarantee the right of children born through medically assisted techniques to a mother and a father. Medically assisted procreation is widely available in places such as Britain, Belgium and Spain but it is reserved in France to heterosexual couples, with most or all of the bill paid for by public healthcare funds. France was the 14th country in the world to legalize gay marriage. The CCNE, which is made up of a rotating membership of 39 people representing the main religions as well as ethics experts and scientific researchers, was created by late President Francois Mitterrand in 1983. Gay rights group SOS Homophibie welcomed its recommendation and called on Macron to legislate rapidly. The CCNE said it opposed recourse to surrogate mothers, one of the only ways gay male couples could aspire to parenting, though they can adopt.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/france-politics-procreation-idUSL1N1JO0TF"},

The East African nation considers the project at Stiegler's Gorge in the UNESCO-designated Selous Game Reserve as vital in its bid to diversify its energy mix as part of plans to end chronic energy shortages. Covering 50,000 sq km, the reserve is one of the largest protected areas in Africa, according to UNESCO. It is know for its elephants, black rhinoceroses and giraffes, among many other species.  President John Magufuli  wants construction of this project to start as quickly as possible and produce an abundant supply of electricity to speed up the development of the country , his office said in a statement. It did not give the cost of the project. The statement said a team of experts from Ethiopia would arrive in the country this week to provide advice on its implementation. Ethiopia has an array of hydropower projects under construction, including the $4.1 billion Grand Renaissance Dam along the Nile River that will churn out 6,000 MW upon completion. Authorities say hydropower projects will ease shortage in a country where demand for power currently outpaces supply. Tanzania also aims to add about 2,000 MW in gas-fired generation by 2018.  However, critics say construction of a hydropower dam in a major river that runs through the Selous Game Reserve could affect wildlife and their habitats downstream.  The government has previously come under criticism for granting Australia-based miner Mantra Resources to build a $400 million uranium mine in the same sanctuary despite pressure from environmental groups who opposed to the project.

The investment giant with oversight of $5.4 trillion in assets will buy Denver-based Cachematrix Holdings LLC in a deal slated to close next quarter, according to a statement by both companies. Terms were not disclosed. Cachematrix builds a software tool that banks can provide to corporate treasurers managing the cash and short-term debt they hold. Investments can be made in money-market funds provided by BlackRock and rival money managers, such as Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Just last week, BlackRock said it would take a stake in Scalable Capital, a European digital investment manager. The deals come two months after BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters he was considering up to four small acquisitions to shore up the New York-based company's technology and investment expertise. Fink has placed an unusual emphasis on technology for a company in his industry, including through the company's Aladdin operating system for investment management, which it licenses to rivals. The latest deal gives BlackRock a new stable of bank clients and pushes Aladdin further into the business of advising companies on how to invest their cash. In a statement, BlackRock said it plans to combine some of Cachematrix's features with Aladdin. On its website, Cachematrix lists Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and HSBC (HSBA.L) among its clients and reports assisting with $200 billion of client assets. Banks trying to meet strict requirements intended to prevent another financial crisis have been looking to shed deposits that would require them to hold more capital. Businesses have been eager to find places to put cash as ultra-easy monetary policy has pushed yields on debt to historic lows. BlackRock in 2015 expanded its reach in the business of managing large institutions' cash and short-term investments when it acquired the money-market fund business run by Bank of America. BlackRock's cash business included nearly $400 billion in assets at the end of March. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-moneymarket-idUSL1N1JK00K"},

The issue became a hot election topic after Merkel's three potential coalition partners, including her current SPD  partners, made it a condition for sharing power, effectively forcing the conservative chancellor's hand. At an event hosted by women's magazine  Brigitte  on Monday evening, Merkel said she had taken note of other German parties favoring same-sex marriage and would allow a free vote.  I would like to lead the discussion more into a situation where it is a question of conscience rather than something I push through with a majority vote,  she said. The move could antagonize some in her traditionally Catholic conservative bloc, some of whom oppose any change. Merkel has previously argued against same-sex marriage.  SPD leader Martin Schulz said on Tuesday his party would push for a vote in parliament this week, before the start of the summer recess.  I hope our colleagues in the conservatives will cooperate,  he said, raising the pressure on his conservative partners - who want a vote after the election. Schulz needs to make up ground for his center-left party in the election race and has sharpened his attacks on Merkel, but he made clear he would not end the coalition. Merkel's conservatives accused him of acting irresponsibly.  That is a breach of trust,  said Volker Kauder, head of Merkel's conservative bloc in parliament, adding the SPD's behavior on such a sensitive topic showed it was  not suited to government .   With broad support among Germans for gay marriage, the law would likely get easy approval in the lower house of parliament if conservatives could vote according to their conscience and not face a party whip.  Polls put Merkel's conservatives 10-15 points ahead of the SPD, but short of a parliamentary majority.  The SPD, pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens have made gay marriage, a step up from same-sex civil partnerships which have been allowed since 2001, a condition for a tie-up. The LSVD association representing gays welcomed Merkel's shift while describing it as a face-saving measure.   After 15 years of an ideological blockade .. social pressure and the commitments of other parties have made an impact,  said LSVD spokesman Axel Hochrein.  Equal rights for all people is part of our constitution,  he said.

We offer our condolences to the those who lost their lives and to those who suffered injuries,  Shigehisa Takada, chairman and CEO of Takata, said at the company's last annual shareholder meeting as a listed company. The meeting came a day after Takata, facing tens of billions of dollars in costs and liabilities following almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits, said it had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan and the United States. As part of the arrangements it will be largely acquired for $1.6 billion by the Chinese-owned U.S.-based Key Safety Systems. The grandson of the company's founder, Takada was criticized in the Japanese media for failing to address victims at a press conference announcing the bankruptcy on Monday.

Takada  was full of excuses,  said one female investor in her 40s from Tokyo.   Constantly blaming the media and those around him, it's not surprising things ended up like this,  she said.  The ammonium nitrate compound used in the air bags was found to become volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat, causing the devices to explode with too much force and spray shrapnel into vehicle compartments. Takata shares were untraded with a glut of sell orders on Tuesday. The company is due to be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on July 27.

The longer the crisis around Qatar continues, the deeper and stronger the lines of conflict will become,  Gabriel told reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.   We hope that there soon can be direct discussion among all those involved because a further escalation will serve no one.  Gabriel said a 2015 agreement in which major powers lifted international sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program had helped avert military conflict. U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the deal, but Gabriel said Germany and Europe would resist any efforts to cancel it. He said Iran and Germany remained  worlds apart  on Israel's right to exist, which he called  non-negotiable , but that he and Zarif had open discussions about that issue and many others. Gabriel said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was trying to make Iran more attractive to foreign investors as part of a broad effort to improve the lives of the Iranian people. But he said Iran could also improve its standing by helping to reduce tensions in the region. Zarif said Iran was interested in working toward a political solution to the conflict with Qatar - which, unlike its Gulf neighbors, maintains good relations with Tehran - arguing that  pressure and sanctions and blockades  were not the answer. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of support for Islamist militants, an allegation Qatar denies. They have since issued 13 demands including closing Al Jazeera television, curbing relations with Iran, shutting a Turkish base and paying reparations. Gabriel said he viewed the Arab list as the  starting point of negotiations, not the end . Zarif also invited Gabriel to visit Iran amid a push by both countries to expand business and trade ties. He said the German finance and economics ministers had pledged during his meetings in Berlin to use all means to strengthen trade.

The East African nation considers the project at Stiegler's Gorge in the UNESCO-designated Selous Game Reserve as vital in its bid to diversify its energy mix as part of plans to end chronic energy shortages. Covering 50,000 sq km, the reserve is one of the largest protected areas in Africa, according to UNESCO. It is know for its elephants, black rhinoceroses and giraffes, among many other species.  President John Magufuli  wants construction of this project to start as quickly as possible and produce an abundant supply of electricity to speed up the development of the country , his office said in a statement. It did not give the cost of the project. The statement said a team of experts from Ethiopia would arrive in the country this week to provide advice on its implementation. Ethiopia has an array of hydropower projects under construction, including the $4.1 billion Grand Renaissance Dam along the Nile River that will churn out 6,000 MW upon completion. Authorities say hydropower projects will ease shortage in a country where demand for power currently outpaces supply. Tanzania also aims to add about 2,000 MW in gas-fired generation by 2018.  However, critics say construction of a hydropower dam in a major river that runs through the Selous Game Reserve could affect wildlife and their habitats downstream.  The government has previously come under criticism for granting Australia-based miner Mantra Resources to build a $400 million uranium mine in the same sanctuary despite pressure from environmental groups who opposed to the project.

Emphasising that Europe's largest economy was growing strongly and adding jobs, Schaeuble, who has been finance minister since 2009, said September's vote was an opportunity for voters to say who was best placed to continue Germany's sound stewardship.  These elections are not about the achievements of the past,  he told a meeting of the conservative Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) economic council.  They are about who we can trust with the best recipes for the coming years.  Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU holds a comfortable poll lead, but the SPD hopes to close the gap by promising to use capital taxes to finance a drive to reduce inequality. Schaeuble used his speech to representatives of German business to warn of the dangers of this approach.  The investment rate in Germany is not as high as it should be. Whoever leads a debate on redistribution is leading a debate that doesn't improve but harms investment,  he said to applause from hundreds of party and business representatives.  We don't need working groups to know that reintroducing capital taxes would be poison for Germany as an investment location in a globalised economy,  he said.  We need to make sure the state remains effective without consuming an ever greater share of gross domestic product.  Schaeuble said Britain's decision to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president were some of the biggest challenges facing the continent, repeating his calls for deeper fiscal cooperation to match the euro zone's monetary union. But said helping to stabilise Africa would be Europe's greatest challenge in coming decades. If it fails, it could face a migration crisis that would dwarf the one experienced in 2015, when more than a million migrants arrived on Europe's southern shores, he warned.

NBG is selling the unit as part of a restructuring plan approved by the European Union to exit non-banking operations and focus on core banking.  The board gave its green light to the sale,  the banker said. The banker did not disclose details of the agreed sale price or other terms.

Calamos-EXIN was competing against three interested Chinese groups: Fosun, Shanghai-based Gongbao and Wintime.

Petroleos de Venezuela [PDVSA.UL] last week launched one of its largest offers on the open market in recent years to buy more than 6 million barrels of fuel and up to 9 million barrels of diluents for the second half of 2017. The tenders come as the company known as PDVSA struggles to pay suppliers for previously imported cargoes, which in some cases have been waiting for months to discharge at Venezuelan ports. PDVSA has few options to supply Venezuela's domestic market and feed some of its refining units other than importing what it has been unable to produce domestically, according to the documents. Venezuela's Paraguana Refining Center, which consists of the Amuay and Cardon refineries, will process only 405,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July due to maintenance and a lack of light oil and spare parts, according to the documents and a union leader. The original plan for July was to process 437,000 bpd, or 46 percent of capacity, one of the document says, close to the processing rates registered in recent months.

Alitalia filed in May to be put under special administration for the second time in less than a decade, starting a process that will lead to the airline being overhauled, sold off or wound up.  In case of an acquisition, we would be interested in a majority stake, not a minority one,  Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told journalists during a news conference in Rome.  We are not interested in a 49 percent stake.  Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, had already expressed an interest in Alitalia, but previously stressed it was keen on cooperating with the business rather than buying it. Ryanair had also said it wanted to provide short-haul traffic to feed Alitalia's long-haul network and offered to deploy aircraft this summer if the Italian carrier cut capacity significantly. However, on Tuesday O'Leary said Ryanair would consider a bid for the entire airline once it was restructured by the administrators. More than 30 parties have expressed an interest in Alitalia, although local media said none of the offers were for the entire airline but only for specific assets such as planes or airport slots. The commissioners have now given selected parties access to Alitalia's books, with non-binding offers due by July 21. The government has repeatedly said it would prefer to sell the airline in one block, partly to minimise the impact on its 12,500 staff. It has ruled out re-nationalising Alitalia. Whereas Etihad Airways, which came to Alitalia's rescue in 2014, was bound by European rules that limit ownership by groups from outside the EU to 49 percent, Dublin-based Ryanair would be free to buy a bigger stake. Without a majority stake, Etihad's influence was limited despite being the largest single investor and the lack of full control meant it could not deal with labour and other problems effectively. Ryanair already has a strong presence in Italy. The airline expects its Italian passengers to rise to 36 million this year, O'Leary said. Official traffic data put the total at 32.6 million last year. (Writing by Agnieszka Flak; Editing by Keith Weir)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/alitalia-ma-ryanair-hldgs-idUSL8N1JO3OX"},

Known as pyrosomes, they are tubular colonies of hundreds or thousands of tiny individual creatures called zooids, enmeshed together in a gelatinous tunic roughly the consistency of gummy bear candy.  No relation to jellyfish, they resemble bumpy, opaque pickles in the water, typically a few centimeters or inches long, though some grow 1 or 2 feet (30cm or 60cm) in length. They feed by filtering microscopic algae, or phytoplankton, as they float with the current, and are known to glow in the dark - a bioluminescent characteristic that gives the organism its scientific name -- Pyrosoma, Greek for  fire body.  Pyrosomes have rarely if ever been seen along the U.S. West Coast until 2012, when first spotted in California waters. Since then, they have gradually multiplied and spread north, before exploding in numbers this spring, according to scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Although harmless to humans, they have been especially troublesome to the commercial salmon catch in Oregon, with large globs of the rubbery critters clogging fishing gear by the thousands in recent months. Some have even washed ashore.  It gets to a point where they're so abundant, you can’t even fish out there, so you have to pick up your gear and move elsewhere,  Nancy Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Oregon Salmon Commission, said on Monday. A single five-minute trawl with a research net by scientists off the Columbia River in late May scooped up roughly 60,000 pyrosomes, NOAA reported. Pyrosomes – colonies of thousands of individual organisms called zooids – are pictured aboard a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research vessel in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Oregon in this May 2017 handout photo obtained by Reuters June 26, 2017.  Hilarie Sorensen/NOAA Fisheries/Handout via REUTERSFishermen were also hit in southeastern Alaska, where some crews suspended operations earlier this year when pyrosome densities were at their height, said Aaron Baldwin, a fishery biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.  There were clouds of them in the water,  he said. Karen Johnson, who fishes for halibut and tracks pyrosome reports on her Facebook page in Sitka, Alaska, said she has personally seen them glowing in a bucket of live specimens caught by her brother. Pyrosomes – colonies of thousands of individual organisms called zooids – are pictured aboard a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research vessel in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Oregon in this May 2017 handout photo obtained by Reuters June 26, 2017.  Hilarie Sorensen/NOAA Fisheries/Handout via REUTERS I stuck them in a dark room, and moved the water a little bit, and sure enough, they were bioluminescent,  she told Reuters. Scientists believe the pyrosome phenomenon is related to elevated sea temperatures along the Pacific Coast that have brought other changes to marine life during the past few years, including a surge in California sea lion strandings. More baffling is how far from the tropics pyrosomes have strayed.  Certainly being up in Alaska is way out of their range,  NOAA research biologist Ric Brodeur said. Still unclear is whether they will linger long enough to significantly upset the region's food web. Pyrosomes are extremely efficient filters of phytoplankton, the principal diet of tiny shrimp-like krill, which in turn are a staple for some species of fish, whales and even seabirds, according to biologists.  Organisms like pyrosomes typically reproduce quickly, though their numbers could crash again once conditions become less favorable, NOAA scientist Keith Sakuma said, adding,  We just don't know what the long-term implications area.

Fitch has also affirmed all other ratings assigned to New York Life and certain of its subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings reflect New York Life's leading market position in the U.S. individual life insurance market, extremely strong capitalization and conservative operating profile. Key competitive strengths include the company's strong brand recognition, well-established market position, effective career distribution system and its stable block of participating whole life insurance. New York Life is one of the top producers of whole life insurance and a leading writer of guaranteed income annuities. The company's market position is deepened by its loyal and productive career agency distribution channel, which Fitch believes reduces pricing pressure and anti-selection in competitive market environments. Fitch views New York Life's extremely strong capitalization as a fundamental strength to its rating, which is reflected by its RBC ratio of 550%, Prism capital model score of 'Extremely Strong' and low operating leverage at year-end 2016. Financial leverage, defined as surplus notes to total adjusted capital (TAC), remained low at 8%. New York Life reported a 3% increase in TAC during 2016 to $24 billion, which was primarily driven by earnings and unrealized investment gains. Fitch views New York Life's profitability as moderate on an absolute basis but favorable on a risk-adjusted basis, given its conservative product profile and operating strategy. Its large, traditional life insurance book generates high-quality, stable earnings, which is supported by its non-insurance business. The company reported statutory net income of $1.1 billion in 2016 compared with $257 million in 2015. The statutory accounting treatment of the company's acquisition of John Hancock's closed block adversely affected results in 2015. Fitch expects the relative stability of New York Life's par whole life book and earnings diversification from non-insurance businesses to be somewhat offset by low interest rates and lower income from limited partnerships investments. New York Life manages a well-diversified liquid investment portfolio that continues to perform well, despite continued low interest rates. The company's risky assets ratio remains above the industry average and in line with similarly rated mutual peers with participating products, given their strategy to pass investment performance to policyholders. As of year-end 2016, New York Life's risky asset ratio was 96%, driven primarily by its above-average exposure to Schedule BA assets. Credit impairments remain modest and well below historical averages. The ratings on the funding agreement-backed note programs of New York Life Funding and New York Life Global Funding recognize that the trust obligations are secured by funding agreements issued by New York Life with cash flow structures that enable the trustees to pay the principal and interest on the notes. Thus, the note programs are dependent on New York Life's credit quality and are assigned a rating equal to the company's IFS rating. RATING SENSITIVITIES New York Life's IFS ratings are currently at Fitch's highest level. Key ratings triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --A decline in capitalization which includes an RBC ratio below 450% or a PRISM capital model score below 'Extremely Strong'; --Future increases in financial leverage to more than 15%, or a reduction in GAAP-based, EBIT fixed-charge coverage below 6x; --Significantly reduced profitability evidenced by a GAAP operating ROA sustained below 0.5%; --A major acquisition that leads New York Life away from its core expertise and significantly reduces the proportion of its participating whole life insurance; --An unexpected shift in tax, regulatory or market dynamics that weakens New York Life's competitive strengths. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: New York Life Insurance Company --IFS at 'AAA'; --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --$1,000,000,000 5.875% surplus note due May 15, 2033 at 'AA'; --$1,000,000,000 6.75% surplus note due Nov. 15, 2039 at 'AA'. New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation --IFS at 'AAA'. NYL Capital Corporation --Commercial paper at 'F1+'. New York Life Funding --Program rating at 'AAA'.

Pope Francis would like to heal a decades-old rift with China, where Catholics are divided between those loyal to him and those who belong to a government-controlled official church. The Vatican said in a statement on Monday it was  observing with grave concern the personal situation of Bishop Peter Shao Zhumin of Wenzhou, forcibly removed from his episcopal see some time ago . Asked about the Vatican's comments, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China protects the right religious belief in accordance with the law along with  normal  religious activities, but like other countries will strengthen its management of religious matters.  We oppose any country, any party, using so-called individual cases to interfere in China's internal affairs,  Lu said. The government has not publicly commented on where the bishop might be or what has happened to him.  The diocesan Catholic community and his relatives have no news or reasons for his removal, nor do they know where he is being held,  the Vatican said in its statement about Shao.  One obstacle to better ties is the question of who should make senior clerical appointments in China. China says bishops must be named by the Chinese Catholic community and refuses to accept the authority of the pope, whom it sees as the head of a foreign state that has no right to meddle in China's affairs. The two sides have been at loggerheads since the expulsion of foreign missionaries from China after the Communists took power in 1949. Another source of friction is the Vatican's maintenance of official ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a wayward province to be taken back by force if necessary.

Several have announced plans for EU subsidiaries so they can continue to sell their policies across Europe.  To meet our clients' needs as an industry and ensure full compliance with the law, the government has to deliver an orderly withdrawal, a stable transition and a sensible and mutually beneficial future trading relationship,  Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, said in a statement ahead of the trade body's conference on Brexit on Tuesday. The ABI said it would like to see formal cooperation between Britain's main political parties in Westminster and between the upper and lower houses of parliament to ensure a Brexit deal. It said insurance issues that needed to be resolved included the treatment of contracts written before Brexit but still in force after Brexit, the future of the European health insurance card which cuts travel insurance for Britons, and the risk of increased complications around driving in Europe. Stephen Barclay in his first speech as City minister told the conference he was listening to industry concerns. Global reinsurers and Lloyd's of London have also said Britain and the EU need to maintain access to one another's markets and existing EU insurance contracts should remain in place after Brexit. Brexit is a worry for EU insurers too, conference speakers said, as insurance companies with EU bases currently hold more than 700  passports  allowing them to sell policies across the EU, including into Britain.  Brexit has immediate effects on countries within the EU and if we don't get it right, the consequences will be quite dramatic,  Kevin Thompson, CEO of Insurance Ireland, told the conference.

The military arrested the journalists in Myanmar's northeastern Shan state on Monday after they covered a drug-burning event organised by the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), an ethnic armed group designated as an  unlawful association  by the Yangon authorities. The reporters are from two media outlets publishing both in Burmese and English, the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) and the Irrawaddy. They were among the few media organisations providing the world independent coverage of Myanmar when it was under military rule before a democratic transition began in 2011. The arrests alarmed Myanmar's media community, increasing fears that freedom of speech has become increasingly restricted since the government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi took power in April last year.  Everyone should be treated according to the law,  Suu Kyi's spokesman Zaw Htay told Reuters. He added that the military told him it planned to charge the reporters under the Unlawful Association Act. A military source confirmed this. Citing information from the army, Zaw Htay said the three reporters and four other men arrested with them were  being treated very well  at a military guesthouse and would be handed over to the police  tomorrow or the day after tomorrow . Despite pressure from human rights bodies and the West, Suu Kyi's government has retained loosely worded security laws dating to British colonial rule, which ended in 1948, and decried by monitors as violating free speech. Suu Kyi has not spoken out against increasingly frequent arrests of reporters and activists. The Unlawful Association Act has long been used by the authorities to arbitrarily arrest and detain people in Myanmar, in particular people in ethnic and religious minority areas, according to human rights watchdog Amnesty International, which has called on the government to release the journalists. Western governments have also expressed their concern over the incident.  Journalists need to be able to do their work, as a free press is essential to Myanmar's success,  the U.S. embassy in Yangon said on its official Facebook page. The editors from the publications where the reporters work told Reuters they had tried obtaining explanations from the military and the government, but to no avail.  We are all concerned about the situation, because we have lost connection with the detainees,  Than Win Htut, a DVB editor, told Reuters.

The move would cause a huge problem for the state, which has accumulated a $15 billion bill backlog due to a budget stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. It could force Illinois to stop making full payments on other state-mandated or court-ordered spending such as pensions and payroll.  The filing in U.S. District Court by attorneys representing Medicaid recipients asked Judge Joan Lefkow to order the state to pay $500 million a month for four months to start reducing a $3.1 billion pile of unpaid bills owed to managed care organizations that turn pay doctors and others.  As long as Illinois remains without an enacted budget, the proposed order calls for the state to spend an additional $586 million a month to cover Medicaid-related bills incurred after June 30, 2017.    The proposed order noted that eventual federal Medicaid reimbursements would reduce Illinois' monthly outlay to $543 million. The two sides are scheduled to appear on Wednesday before Lefkow, who previously ruled Illinois' minimal payments to managed care organizations did not comply with federal consent decrees that resulted from two cases filed against the state in 1992.  The judge had ordered negotiations aimed at getting Illinois to  substantial  compliance with the decrees, noting the state has managed to make its monthly bond and pension payments on time and in full. [nL1N1JG1J2] Monthly payments related to the Medicaid and other consent decrees have totaled only about $160 million. [nL1N1J30SL] In the wake of Lefkow's order, Illinois general obligation bond prices plummeted and yields soared in municipal market trading, although the bonds subsequently clawed back some losses. The state comptroller last week pledged to not delay or diminish bond payments.  Illinois Attorney General spokeswoman Eileen Boyce said the filing is under review  in light of the state's ongoing severe fiscal crisis.   Rauner ordered lawmakers back into a special session, which began June 21 and is scheduled to end on Friday, to pass a budget before fiscal 2018 begins on Saturday. [nL1N1JN1VD] Entering a third-straight fiscal year without a spending plan could sink Illinois' credit ratings to  junk,  a first for any U.S. state.

From cooks, babysitters and gardeners to laundry workers and carers for the elderly, the  Kaushalya Karnataka  - or skilled Karnataka - scheme aims to improve skills of domestic workers so they can demand better salaries, benefits and more job options.  Domestic workers are the most exploited among the unorganized sector workers and the scheme wants to change that,  said Ashraful Hasan, director at the state-run skill development department.  Our program hopes to give a woman cooking in a home the option of joining a bigger catering service or a maid the option of being a professional housekeeper.  There are more than 4 million domestic workers in India, most of them women, according to official data. But campaigners say there are likely to be millions more in the unregulated sector. As demand for domestic help across Indian cities has shot up, there have been several high-profile cases of abuse of maids in recent years, many involving well-off families. A bill to provide domestic workers with a minimum monthly salary of 9,000 Indian rupees ($140) and benefits including social security cover and mandatory time off is awaiting approval in parliament. In Karnataka, there are an estimated 300,000 domestic workers, according to Hasan. While a maid will know how to mop and sweep a floor, the scheme - in which workers will receive up to 10 days' training - will teach them hygiene in the home, how to make a hotel-style bed as well as communication skills, he said. Domestic workers will also be taught how to operate gadgets now common in many urban Indian homes, like dishwashers, washing machines and blenders. Campaigners cautiously welcomed the program, but said better skills would not necessarily lead to better working conditions.  These are largely part-time workers who are not considered as professionals by anyone,  said Geeta Menon of the non-profit Stree Jagruti Samiti that promotes domestic workers' rights.  Unless the government connects the skilled worker to progressive employers, the situation will not change.  The program aims to create an additional 100,000 skilled workers in Karnataka, providing jobs to unemployed youths and  opening up new opportunities for work overseas, officials said. Josephine Valarmathi of the National Domestic Workers' Movement said a government certificate would at least recognize the  dignity of labor  in the work of maids.  It's a start but we have to wait and watch if domestic workers get the dues they have been demanding for years,  she said.

PKN's Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania relies on rail to ship its products to the Klaipeda oil terminal on the Baltic Sea, a route of about 250 kilometres (155 miles), but has been at odds with state-run Lithuanian Railways over transport fees since 2014. In 2016, the railway company took PKN's Lithuanian subsidiary Orlen Lietuva, which operates the refinery, to court over what it said were 6.4 million euros ($7.2 million) in unpaid fees and interest after Orlen rejected fee increases imposed in 2014. One of the sources said that the agreement reached to resolve the matter was favourable for PKN, which is state-owned, because the new fees will be higher than Orlen Lietuva has been paying until now but not as high as those it was supposed to have been paying since the increase in 2014. Lithuania's government said in a statement on Tuesday that Lithuanian Railways and PKN Orlen would sign an agreement in Vilnius on Wednesday but did not give any details. PKN Orlen declined to comment. News of an agreement coincided with the announcement that PKN's long-serving and respected chief financial officer will leave the company, sending PKN shares down 2.7 percent on Tuesday. Heavy Investment Orlen Lietuva has been a financial burden on its parent in recent years. In 2014 PKN wrote down the value of Orlen Lietuva by 4.2 billion zlotys ($1.1 billion) after the refinery swung into the red. It returned to profit in 2015. In total, PKN has spent $4 billion on the Mazeikiai refinery, including the purchase price, since buying a controlling stake from Russia's Yukos in 2006. The dispute over transport fees centred on Orlen Lietuva's rejection of the railway company's new methodology to calculate its fees. Polish newspaper Puls Biznesu, which was first to report that a deal would be signed on Wednesday, said an agreement became possible after Lithuania's parliamentary election in October triggered management reshuffles at state-run firms, including the railways.

Capital One participated through its venture arm, Tel Aviv-based Riskified said in a statement. Riskified, whose clients include U.S. retailers Macy's and Foot Locker Inc, said it would use the funds to expand globally and accelerate sales of its software, which helps merchants spot online payment fraud and reduce false alarms that cause genuine buyers to be turned down. In 2016, every dollar of fraud cost merchants $2.40, up from $2.23 a year ago, according to a report from LexisNexis. Fraud as a percentage of revenues grew to 1.47 percent from 1.32 percent over the year.  As more and more consumers move their shopping online, the fraudsters follow,  Riskified co-founder and Chief Executive Eido Gal said in an emailed response to questions by Reuters.  The market for our service is big and getting bigger.  Founded in 2013, Riskified is among a growing number of software developers which help companies analyze vast amounts of data with little manpower.

Gal described Riskified's investors as strategic partners, but declined to say whether companies owned by Groupe Arnault would be using its technology. LVMH said in May that it would launch an e-commerce site to host all of its brands, as the world's biggest luxury goods group seeks to capitalize on the sector's online sales boom.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, in his first appearance before a congressional committee since his confirmation hearing in the spring, plans to push for adequate funding for the agency's enforcement and examination functions, as well as a $240 million investment in information technology, for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1.  The $240 million that the SEC plans to spend on information technology in FY 2018 is quite modest, by way of comparison, to the amounts that the major Wall Street firms spend on their own information technology systems,  Clayton said in prepared testimony before a U.S. Senate appropriations subcommittee.   In 2016, one large financial institution alone spent more than $9.5 billion on technology firm-wide,  he added. The SEC is asking Congress to keep its budget flat at about $1.6 billion, the same amount that White House also proposed in May.    By contrast, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is asking Congress to approve a $281.5 million budget. That is slightly more than the White House's proposal, which called for keeping the regulator's budget flat at $250 million.  The $31.5 million in additional funds is not a formulaic or superficial number, but a thorough and informed assessment of what the CFTC needs to execute its mission,  acting Chairman Chris Giancarlo said in prepared remarks.  Clayton, in his prepared testimony, planned to stress the importance of the reserve fund, a pool of money established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that the agency has used to help finance technological improvements that help it detect problems in the marketplace. The White House proposal called for scrapping the $50 million reserve fund in 2019. The SEC and White House are also requesting an additional $245 million on top of the $1.6 billion to help pay for upcoming leasing expenses on the agency's headquarters.  Clayton also will announce plans to conduct a national recruitment effort to hire a small business capital formation advocate, a new position at the SEC required by legislation signed into law during the end of former president Barack Obama's administration.

Fed officials have signalled that they plan to continue on their current trajectory of interest rate hikes despite a slow down in inflation. But softer-than-expected U.S. data has given  rise to some caution.                        A huge sell order totalling 1.85 million ounces pushed gold to a six-week low on Monday, although the precious metal ultimately failed to break below the 200-day moving average.          If yesterday gold wasn't able to push below the 200-day moving average that's a positive sign,  said ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele.      The market is sceptical about Fed rate rises this year and next. Overall we're optimistic about the outlook for gold, we (see) a weaker dollar later in the year,  she added.       Spot gold        rose 0.5 percent to $1,250.30 per ounce by 1357 GMT. It hit a near six-week low of $1,236.46 on Monday.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen addresses the British Academy in London at 1700 GMT, after a speech by Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in the U.S. city at 1515 GMT     Before that, the dollar        slipped 0.6 percent against major currencies, hitting a nine month low versus the euro after the European Central Bank President said he might begin to reduce the Bank's emergency economic stimulus.            A weak dollar makes dollar-priced gold cheaper for non-U.S. investors.            Gold prices have gained every month this year save June, thanks partly to geopolitical tensions which most recently included Syrian hostilities, a bailout of Italian banks, the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump and Britain's negotiations to quit the European Union.      The gold market is seeing a bit of a bid right now. Growing tensions in the Middle East may be playing a part,  said INTL FCStone's Ed Meir in a note.      The White House warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Monday that he and his military would  pay a heavy price  if it conducted a chemical weapons attack and said the United States had reason to believe such preparations were underway.

While financial technology is changing how financial services and information are being delivered, there is no evidence that services like crowdfunding,  robo  advice and cloud computing will fundamentally change underlying activities such as lending, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) said in a report published on Tuesday. The findings of the FSB, which coordinates regulation for the Group of 20 Economies (G20), signal no immediate rush to bring in new rules at the global level to mitigate financial stability risks. Regulators have taken a relatively relaxed approach to fintech, given its tiny size compared to banks with investment totaling $21 billion in the first nine months of 2016, but the FSB said it would keep monitoring the sector. Apart from potential risks, fintech offers potential benefits as well, such as greater efficiency, transparency, competition and resilience of the financial system, and economic growth, it said.  The FSB will continue to monitor and discuss the evolution of the potential financial stability implications of fintech developments,  it said. A lack of data is also making it harder to assess financial stability threats, and regulators don't want to stifle a new sector with heavy handed rules. Fintech activities are already covered within broader financial rules, and many countries are already planning to take further measures to protect consumers and investors, the FSB said. It identified three  priority areas  for international collaboration on monitoring fintech: managing operational risks such as management failures; mitigating cyber risks; and monitoring risks to the financial system that could emerge as fintech activities increase. The report classifies fintech by activities and primary function, an essential first move before fashioning any new rules.  Regulators need to understand the impact that developments in fintech can have on financial stability, especially given the rapid rise of innovation in this space,  said Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada and chair of the FSB's fintech issues group.  Our report today sets out a clear picture of supervisory and regulatory issues, which the FSB will continue to monitor and discuss going forward.

In a document submitted to the Supreme Court, Rodrigo Janot said Temer  fooled Brazilian citizens  and owed the nation millions in compensation for accepting bribes. The lower house of Congress must now vote on whether to allow the tribunal to try the conservative leader.     Traders expect Temer to garner the support of one-third of the lower house needed to block the trial, although some fear his backing may melt away if lawmakers are forced to vote several times to protect the unpopular president.     The vote, which does not yet have a date, is likely to delay the implementation of Temer's planned reforms of the pension system and labor regulations, seen by investor as key to curb debt and lift long-term economic growth.     The Brazilian real weakened 0.7 percent, while 5-year credit default swaps widened 2 basis points to 237 basis points.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 0.3 percent, dragged down by blue-chips such as lenders Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA and beer producer Ambev SA.     Shares of Kroton Educacional SA and Estácio Participações SA ranked among the biggest decliners on lingering concerns that regulators may veto a tie-up between both college operators.     Losses in the index were capped, however, by a rally in shares of miners and steelmakers, such as Vale SA and Cia Siderúrgica Nacional SA, boosted by soaring prices of metals.     Other Latin American markets were mostly down as traders avoided risky bets ahead of a widely awaited speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen later in the day.     Investors will closely monitor her remarks for clues over future monetary policy after a recent batch of mixed economic figures suggested it may be forced to increase rates at a slower pace than expected.

Whether he would actually take action remains unclear. In April, Trump backed off from a threat to withdraw from NAFTA after he said that Canadian and Mexican leaders telephoned him asking him to halt a planned executive order in favor of opening discussions.

It is the biggest fine the EU has ever imposed on a single company in an antitrust case, exceeding a 1.06-billion-euro sanction handed down to U.S. chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) in 2009. The European Commission said the world's most popular internet search engine has 90 days to stop favoring its own shopping service or face a further penalty per day of up to 5 percent of Alphabet's average daily global turnover. The fine, equivalent to 3 percent of Alphabet's turnover, is the biggest regulatory setback for Google, which settled with U.S. enforcers in 2013 without a penalty after agreeing to change some of its search practices. Related CoverageGoogle says it is considering appeal against EU antitrust fineFactbox: EU hits Google with record $2.7 billion fineThe EU competition enforcer has also charged Google with using its Android mobile operating system to crush rivals, a case that could potentially be the most damaging for the company, with the system used in most smartphones. The company has also been accused of blocking rivals in online search advertising. The Commission found that Google, with a market share in searches of over 90 percent in most European countries, had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager holds a news conference at the EU Commission's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 27, 2017.Francois Lenoir What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation,  European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Google said its data showed people preferred links taking them directly to products they want and not to websites where they have to repeat their search. Slideshow (6 Images) We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission's decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,  Kent Walker, Google's general counsel, said in a statement. The action follows a seven-year investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals such as U.S. consumer review website Yelp (YELP.N), TripAdvisor (TRIP.O), UK price comparison site Foundem, News Corp (NWSA.O) and lobbying group FairSearch. The penalty payment for failure to comply would amount to around $12 million a day based on Alphabet's 2016 turnover of $90.3 billion. The Commission did not specify what changes Google had to make.  This decision is a game-changer. The Commission confirmed that consumers do not see what is most relevant for them on the world’s most used search engine but rather what is best for Google,  said Monique Goyens, director general of EU consumer group BEUC. Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, welcomed the Commission's findings and urged it to act on Google's Android mobile operating system following its 2013 complaint that Google restricted competition in software running on mobile devices.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, in his first appearance before a congressional committee since his confirmation hearing in the spring, plans to push for adequate funding for the agency's enforcement and examination functions, as well as a $240 million investment in information technology, for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1.  The $240 million that the SEC plans to spend on information technology in FY 2018 is quite modest, by way of comparison, to the amounts that the major Wall Street firms spend on their own information technology systems,  Clayton said in prepared testimony before a U.S. Senate appropriations subcommittee.   In 2016, one large financial institution alone spent more than $9.5 billion on technology firm-wide,  he added. The SEC is asking Congress to keep its budget flat at about $1.6 billion, the same amount that White House also proposed in May.    By contrast, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is asking Congress to approve a $281.5 million budget. That is slightly more than the White House's proposal, which called for keeping the regulator's budget flat at $250 million.  The $31.5 million in additional funds is not a formulaic or superficial number, but a thorough and informed assessment of what the CFTC needs to execute its mission,  acting Chairman Chris Giancarlo said in prepared remarks.  Clayton, in his prepared testimony, planned to stress the importance of the reserve fund, a pool of money established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that the agency has used to help finance technological improvements that help it detect problems in the marketplace. The White House proposal called for scrapping the $50 million reserve fund in 2019. The SEC and White House are also requesting an additional $245 million on top of the $1.6 billion to help pay for upcoming leasing expenses on the agency's headquarters.  Clayton also will announce plans to conduct a national recruitment effort to hire a small business capital formation advocate, a new position at the SEC required by legislation signed into law during the end of former president Barack Obama's administration.

President Donald Trump wanted more of that and a less  mean  rollback of Obamacare. Yet the Senate spared only 1 million of the 23 million set to lose health coverage under the House plan, according to Congressional Budget Office figures. On that showing, even a Republican-only deal will need surgery.  The CBO on Monday scored the Senate bill, released on Thursday after weeks of secrecy. It would reduce the U.S. deficit by some $200 billion more over a decade than the plan that passed the House in May, while the projected insurance-premium hikes are steep rather than stratospheric. But they would still be painful for lower and middle-income individuals. For example, a 64-year-old making $26,500 a year would see an increase of more than 280 percent to $6,500 a year by 2026, the CBO said.  Before the CBO's score came out, the White House sought to further undermine the office by saying it has a poor track record in healthcare projections, having overstated the early take-up of coverage under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Yet the CBO is broadly nonpartisan and, importantly, it's consistent in how it evaluates legislation, so its analysis carries weight.  Four conservative Republicans have already said they can't support the current bill, largely because it doesn’t go far enough in repealing Obamacare. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who wrote a commentary on Monday opposing the plan, said the bill would fail if the chamber voted to proceed on Tuesday.  Moderates are also unhappy. Roughly in line with the House bill, under the Senate version Washington would spend around $800 billion less over 10 years on Medicaid – healthcare for lower-income Americans – than under current law, according to the CBO, with 15 million fewer enrolled in the program. Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, as one example, opposes ending the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, which his state and dozens of others adopted.  Republicans have pledged for years that they would repeal Obamacare but they have a slim 52-member majority in the 100-member Senate. Changes that appease conservatives might alienate centrists, and vice versa. The GOP leadership will need both heart and head to pass any form of repeal.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Syngenta, a distant third in the global seeds market behind Monsanto and Dupont (DD.N), is determined not to lose ground on its rivals as the seeds and crop-protection sector continues an unprecedented wave of mergers and acquisitions. The Swiss group, the world's leading crop chemicals maker, itself fought off unwanted suitor Monsanto before agreeing to be taken over by ChemChina to secure better access to Asian markets and is now targeting its own acquisitions and licensing deals.  We are very interested in seed assets from remedies and beyond that,  Chief Executive Erik Fyrwald told a news conference at the group's Basel headquarters, responding to a question about assets to be sold by Bayer. Bayer last month said it will sell its LibertyLink-branded seeds businesses, a key part of asset sales required to satisfy competition authorities looking at the $66 billion Monsanto deal. ChemChina Chairman Ren Jianxin addresses a news conference at the headquarters of Swiss agrochemicals maker Syngenta in Basel, Switzerland June 27, 2017.Arnd Wiegmann The goal is to strengthen Syngenta's leadership position in crop protection and to become an ambitious No.3 in seeds,  the company said in a news release on Tuesday. Slideshow (4 Images)Seeds will be the main plank of the growth strategy to meet ChemChina's target for Syngenta to double its revenue over the next five to 10 years, the Chinese group said on Tuesday. ChemChina, which has acquired close to 98 percent of Syngenta's shares, also plans to float a minority stake in its newly acquired subsidiary on the stock market in the next five years or so to bolster its balance sheet.  The timing of the minority IPO of Syngenta will depend on the market situation, but the time frame would be about five years,  ChemChina Chairman Ren Jianxin, now also Syngenta chairman, said at the news conference. Ren also dismissed as  rumors  reports that ChemChina could merge with state-owned Chinese peer Sinochem.

The technology index fell 0.7 percent due to a drop in the shares of Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet. Alphabet fell 1.2 percent to $960.55 after EU antitrust regulators hit the tech giant with a record $2.7 billion fine. Since the beginning of the year, the tech index has jumped about 19 percent, making it the biggest force behind the S&P;'s record-setting rally. However, the sector has come under pressure of late over concerns about lofty valuations. To make matters worse, investors are also shifting to high-dividend paying defensive sectors such as utilities in a rising interest rate environment.  The indices continue to hover near the very high end of the recent ranges, suggesting this week's end-of-the-quarter window dressing is likely to see more sector rotation,  Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, wrote in a note.  The broadening out of the markets, we believe, is essential for the markets to escape a near-term correction.  Yellen is scheduled to take part in a discussion on global economic issues in London at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). Investors expect Yellen to offer more insight into the state of the U.S. economy, which would support the Fed's forecast of a rate hike this year. Fed officials have signaled that they would look through a slowdown in inflation and continue on their current path for hikes. But investors are skeptical and market pricing shows only a 40 percent chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting. At 9:38 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.84 points, or 0.12 percent, at 21,383.71 and the S&P; 500 was down 5.01 points, or 0.20 percent, at 2,434.06. The Nasdaq Composite was down 28.06 points, or 0.45 percent, at 6,219.09. Seven of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the telecommunications index's 1.16 percent fall leading the decliners. Sprint rose 2.2 percent to $8.20 after the fourth-largest U.S. wireless service provider was said to be in talks with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp about a wireless partnership. Comcast and Charter were down about 0.7 percent. T-Mobile was down 3.4 percent at $61.06 after Reuters reported that Sprint had put its merger talks with the company on hold. General Motors slipped 0.6 percent to $34.30 after the automaker lowered its outlook for new sales in 2017. Fiat Chrysler fell 1.2 percent, while Ford was off 0.5 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,267 to 1,200. On the Nasdaq, 1,316 issues fell and 912 advanced.

The Ivy League school said in the lawsuit it wants to designate all single-occupant restrooms at its law school as gender neutral, but the plan would run afoul of the state building code, which does not count gender-neutral bathrooms when it assesses whether a public building has enough toilets. The suit was filed on Friday in Connecticut Superior Court in New Haven, after the university received complaints from law school students. Yale has asked the state to drop requirements that single-user restrooms have an assigned gender label. Restrooms have become a flashpoint in the fight over transgender rights, following North Carolina passed a law last year requiring people to use public restrooms that corresponded with their birth gender. The measure was partially repealed in March after the state lost hundreds of millions of dollars from economic boycotts. Texas lawmakers are expected to consider a similar measure next month. Proponents of the bathroom bills say they aim to protect individual privacy. That is not a factor in the Yale case, which focuses on single-occupant restrooms.  The proposed shift in designation to gender neutral .... would facilitate quick access to a bathroom within the building for persons of all gender identities,  the 315-year-old university wrote in the lawsuit. The state code would require Yale to build more bathrooms to be in compliance with rules about the number of restrooms for men and women. The school said it would be impractical and unnecessary in its century-old law school building. A spokesman for Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and officials from the state Codes and Standards Committee, which oversees the rules, were not immediately available.

A Moscow-based cyber security firm, Group-IB, said it appeared to be a coordinated attack simultaneously targeting victims in Russia and Ukraine. In Copenhagen, global shipping firm Shipping company A.P. Moller-Maersk said it had suffered a computer system outage caused by a cyber attack thought it was not immediately clear if it was connected. One of the firms Group-IB said had been hit in Russia, Damco, which is Maersk's logistics company. The latest disruptions follow a spate of hacking attempts on state websites in Ukraine in late 2016 and repeated attacks on its power grid that prompted security chiefs to call for improved cyber defences. Rosneft, one of the world's biggest producers of crude oil by volume, said its oil production had not been affected.  The company's servers underwent a powerful hacking attack,  the company said on Twitter.  The hacking attack could lead to serious consequences, but the company has moved to a reserve production processing system and neither oil output nor refining have been stopped.  Rosneft's website was unavailable in Moscow as of 13:25 GMT and had been offline for at least an hour before that. Russian metals giant Evraz said its IT systems had been affected too, Russia's RIA news agency reported. In Ukraine, Yevhen Dykhne, director of Boryspyl Airport, said it had been hit by a cyber attack.  In connection with the irregular situation, some flight delays are possible,  Dykhne said in a post on Facebook. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Pavlo Rozenko said the government's computer network had gone down as well and posted a picture on Twitter of a computer screen with an error message. The Ukrainian central bank said a number of banks and companies, including the state power distributor, were hit by a cyber attack that disrupted some operations.  As a result of these cyber attacks these banks are having difficulties with client services and carrying out banking operations,  the central bank said in a statement.

The justices will hear the plaintiffs' appeal of a ruling last year in favor of Iran by the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court's ruling in the case is also likely to dictate the outcome of a similar dispute pending before the justices in which four different groups of plaintiffs representing those injured in other allegedly Iran-backed attacks are seeking to enforcement court judgments by seizing $17.6 million in assets held by Iranian government-owned Bank Melli. At issue is how to determine what assets are immune from seizure under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, a federal law that restricts when foreign entities can be sued in U.S. courts. The long-running Chicago lawsuit arose from a 1997 attack in which three members of the Islamic militant group Hamas blew themselves up in Jerusalem, killing five people. Eight U.S. citizens were injured. They and some of their relatives, including lead plaintiff Jenny Rubin, sued Iran in a U.S. court for its alleged role and obtained a $71.5 million judgment that they then sought to collect on. They targeted three collections of ancient Persian artifacts including prehistoric pottery, ornaments and precious tablets with Elamite writing held by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History and the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute. The museums have said they own the artifacts, but the plaintiffs maintain that Iran does. Iran has previously sought return of some of the items. The court will hear arguments and decide the case in its next term, which begins in October. In a similar case, the Supreme Court last year ruled that almost $2 billion in frozen Iranian assets must be turned over to American families of people killed in the 1983 truck bombing by Hezbollah militants of a U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut and other attacks blamed on Iran.

CCO is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter). CCO's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is currently 'BB+' with a Stable Outlook. The company is expected to use net proceeds to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks of Class A common stock of Charter or common units of Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (CCH), a subsidiary of Charter. As of March 31, 2017, Charter had $1.9 billion available under its Class A common stock buyback program, an amount that excludes any potential buybacks of CCH common units. Pro forma for the proposed issuance, as well as debt issuances in April 2017 and subsequent note repurchases, Charter had approximately $63.3 billion of debt outstanding as of March 31, 2017, including $47.4 billion of senior secured debt. Today's issuance is in line with Fitch's expectation that Charter will issue debt using additional debt capacity created primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from future prospective debt issuances issued under additional debt capacity created are expected to be used for investment in the business, accretive acquisitions and shareholder returns. Charter management has stated it plans to target the low end of its target leverage range of 4x to 4.5x. KEY RATING DRIVERS M&A; Activity Credit-Positive: In May 2016, Charter completed its merger with Time Warner Cable and acquisition of Bright House Networks. Fitch continues to view these transactions positively and believes they strengthen Charter's overall credit profile. Fitch estimates that on a pro forma basis for the last 12 months (LTM) ended March 31, 2017, including a full year of the transactions and recent debt issuances and redemptions, total leverage was 4.3x while senior secured leverage was 3.2x. Integration Key to Success: Charter's ability to continue managing the simultaneous integration of two transactions and limit disruption to its overall operations is critical. Charter is also managing the transition to all-digital services and the introduction of its interactive IP-based video user interface across the TWC and Bright House systems. Similar efforts in their legacy systems boosted ARPU and accelerated growth in revenue, EBITDA margin and FCF. Credit Profile Changes: As of March 31, 2017, Charter served 25.1 million residential customers and is the country's second largest cable multiple-system operator. Pro forma LTM revenue and EBITDA totalled approximately $40.5 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively. Charter's pro forma total leverage and senior secured leverage have declined since peaking at 4.4x and 3.5x, respectively, at June 30, 2016. The decline was driven primarily by EBITDA growth as Charter benefited from ongoing operating improvements. Improving Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are having a positive impact on the company's operating profile, resulting in a strengthened competitive position. The market-share-driven strategy, which is focused on enhancing the overall competitiveness of Charter's video service and leveraging its all-digital infrastructure, is improving subscriber metrics, growing revenue and average revenue per unit (ARPU) trends, and stabilizing operating margins. Debt Capacity Growth: Charter management has stated it plans to target the low end of its target leverage range of 4x to 4.5x. Fitch expects Charter to continue to create additional debt capacity and remain within its target leverage primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under additional debt capacity created are expected to be used for investment in the business, accretive acquisitions and shareholder returns. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --Mid-single-digit pro forma revenue growth highlighted by continued high-speed data and commercial service revenue growth. --Pro forma EBITDA margin improves as ARPU growth from subscribers taking more advanced video services and higher-speed data service tiers offsets increased programming costs and spending to enhance customer service and products. --Fitch estimates Charter will generate more than $4 billion of FCF in 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating actions would be contemplated given the following: --Integrating TWC and Bright House while limiting disruption in the company's overall operations; --Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to its industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives; --Operating profile strengthens as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth envisioned when implementing the current operating strategy; --Reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x. Fitch believes negative rating actions would likely occur given the following: --A leveraging transaction or the adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan; --Adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy; --A perceived weakening of Charter's competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth along with strengthening operating margins. LIQUIDITY Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory given the rating category. Charter's financial flexibility will improve in step with the growth of FCF generation following the completion of the transactions. Charter generated $3.7 billion of FCF during the LTM ended March 31, 2017, and Fitch expects Charter to generate more than $4 billion in 2017. The company's liquidity position at March 31, 2017 includes cash of $2.7 billion and is supported by $2.8 billion of borrowing capacity from its $3 billion revolver, which expires in May 2021, and anticipated FCF generation. Charter's pro forma maturity profile is manageable with less than 10% of outstanding debt maturing before 2020 including $148 million in 2017, $2.2 billion in 2018, and $3.5 billion in 2019. Fitch believes that Charter has the financial flexibility to retire near-term maturities with cash on hand and future FCF.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, speaking at an event organised by the Association of Banks in Singapore late on Tuesday, said that these will be businesses that are related to or complementary to banks' core financial operations.  The line between financial and non-financial business is blurring. Banks are facing increasing competition from online and non-financial players that have leveraged their large user base to provide digital wallets, payments and remittance services,  Heng said.  To maintain our competitive edge, we must ready ourselves for the next wave of change,  he said. In this year's budget, Singapore unveiled projects to invest in infrastructure, deepen the workforce's technology skills and digitalise the economy. This came after a Singapore advisory panel proposed a 10-year strategy aimed at ensuring annual economic growth of 2-3 percent. The Monetary Authority of Singapore said in a statement that it will allow banks to engage in the operation of digital platforms that match buyers and sellers of consumer goods or services as well as the online sale of such goods or services. Banks are currently prohibited from selling consumer goods.  The logic is compelling. With the ubiquity of the smartphone, customers increasingly want banking to be seamlessly integrated into their daily lives,  said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta.  There are a number of areas where a banking service can be nicely integrated into e-commerce, and we welcome the opportunity to do so,  he said. The central bank said banks need not seek prior regulatory approval before conducting or acquiring major equity stakes in permissible non-financial businesses. To limit their exposure and ensure that banks continue to focus on their core businesses, MAS will cap such permissible non-financial operations to 10 percent of the banks' capital. MAS will issue a consultation paper detailing the policy changes by the end of September.

The new bank will hold around 223 billion euros ($250.85 billion) worth of assets, Bankia said. The two nationalised banks - both formed from the merger of several failed lenders - were bailed out at the height of the financial crisis with around 24 billion euros of public money after heavy losses on property loans. Bankia Chairman Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri said the deal would help recover public funds. He did not rule out further divestment by the state in 2017. The state holds around 67 percent of Bankia and 65 percent of the smaller BMN. After the deal, Spain's bank bailout fund FROB is expected to hold around 66.6 percent of the new lender.  It was the right timing from a macroeconomic point of view due to the strengths of the Spanish economy and also due to the pace of the current reduction of the unemployment rate,  Bankia Chief Executive Jose Sevilla told analysts on a conference call. Spain's economy grew by 3.2 percent in 2016 and is expected to match that this year, boosted by private consumption, a tourism boom and strengthening exports, and while unemployment remains the second highest in the EU after Greece, job creation is also gaining pace. Below Market Expectations The lenders agreed to a 7.8-for-1 share swap deal, valuing BMN at around 825 million euros ($924 million) or 0.4 times book value, below market expectations of between 0.45 to 0.6 times book value, according to Deutsche Bank and UBS analysts. In March BMN was valued at over 1 billion euros by an independent adviser selected by FROB. The state had already injected 1.6 billion euros into BMN. Bankia shares rose 4 percent on Tuesday. Analysts said the deal made sense because each bank had a different geographic footprint. However, the combined group is expected to shrink as lenders struggle with ultra-low interest rates and competition over lending. After years of consolidation, the number of lenders in Spain has shrunk to 13 from 55 in 2008 before a housing market bubble burst, triggering an almost five-year economic slump. Banco Popular, the country's sixth-biggest bank, was taken over by Spain's largest bank Santander in early June for a nominal one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse without the use of public aid. On Sunday, Italy started winding down two failed regional banks in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros. The Bankia and BMN tie-up is expected to increase earnings per share by 16 percent after three years, equivalent to an increase of 245 million euros in net profit in this period, and would be positive after one year. The transaction is also expected to generate gross cost synergies of 155 million euros a year. The total capital invested will be 2 billion euros, including 1 billion euros for the clean-up of BMN's balance sheet and 300 million euros for restructuring costs. After the deal is finalised, Bankia expects fully-loaded core capital ratio - a closely watched measure of a bank's strength - of 12 percent by December with a Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE) increase of around 120 basis points. In a statement to the market regulator, Bankia said it would issue a maximum of 205.7 million new shares to help finance the deal, which is expected to be finalised by the end of this year. $1 = 0.8890 euros Additional reporting by Paul Day and Tomas Cobos; Editing by Susan Thomas","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bmn-ma-bankia-idUSL8N1JO0XL"},

Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein also lambasted British Prime Minister Theresa May for threatening to change human rights laws if they got in the way of security operations, saying her words would give heart to authoritarian governments. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights told an audience in London late on Monday that the struggle against terrorism was  being exploited by governments  and risked undermining international rights treaties.  And this contagion is spreading, fast,  Zeid said, citing suppression of dissent in Egypt, Bahrain and Turkey  under the banner of fighting terrorism . The U.N. Convention against Torture lays down an absolute ban, he said, noting that criminals also have basic rights.  If other leaders start to follow the same rhetorical course, undermining the Convention with their words, the practice of torture is likely to broaden, and that would be fatal.  Scuttling the pact would remove a pillar of international law, he said. Trump said in January that he thought waterboarding - an interrogation technique banned by President Barack Obama that simulates drowning - worked as an intelligence-gathering tool. But he also said he would defer to his senior officials.    Persistent Flirtation  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein of Jordan speaks during a news conference at the United Nations European headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, May 1, 2017.Pierre AlbouyZeid said he was worried by Trump's  persistent flirtation  with a return to torture. There was little immediate danger of the United States using torture in interrogations, but that could change if there was an attack on U.S. soil, he said.  Mindful of how the American public has, over the last 10 years, become far more accepting of torture, the balance could be tipped in favor of its practice.  After Islamist deadly militant attacks on London and Manchester, May told the Sun newspaper that if human rights laws  get in the way  of measures to tackle Islamist militancy,  we will change those laws to make sure we can do them . Zeid said her remarks no doubt reflected real anger but also seemed  intended to strike a chord with a certain sector of the electorate, and it is this expectation that truly worries me .  Whatever the intention behind her remarks, they were highly regrettable, a gift from a major Western leader to every authoritarian figure around the world who shamelessly violates human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism,  he said. Zeid also decried Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's rights record - police say almost 9,000 people, many of them small-time drug users and dealers, have been killed since he took office.  The president of the Philippines has spoken openly about extra-judicial killings. And the president of the United States of America has said that torture could be necessary in certain circumstances. There is no longer any pretence. They are breaking long-held taboos,  Zeid said.  The dangers to the entire system of international law are therefore very real.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. In December 2010, Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his activism in promoting human rights in China, which responded by freezing diplomatic ties with Norway. They normalized ties in December last year. Liu is being treated in a hospital in the northern city of Shenyang for late-stage liver cancer, having been granted medical parole, his lawyer told Reuters on Monday.  A video of Liu's wife, Liu Xia, who has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize, crying and talking about her husband's condition was shared online late on Monday.  (They) cannot perform surgery, cannot perform radiotherapy, cannot perform chemotherapy,  Liu Xia said in the video. She did not elaborate. It was not clear when the video was filmed. A source close to the family confirmed the authenticity of the video and said Liu was being treated using targeted therapy.  They say his cancer has already spread too far for other treatments, but because we cannot meet the doctors treating him, we have no way to tell if this is true,  he said. Liu and his wife wanted to return to Beijing for treatment but the authorities rejected their request, the source said. The prison bureau of Liaoning province said on Monday that Liu was being treated by eight  well-known tumor experts,  but Western politicians and rights activists have voiced concern about the quality of treatment. The United States called for his release.  We call on the Chinese authorities to not only release Mr. Liu, but also to allow his wife, Ms Liu Xia, out of house arrest,  said Mary Beth Polley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said. China should  provide them the protections and freedoms, such as freedom of movement and access to medical care of his choosing, to which they are entitled under China’s constitution and legal system, and international commitments,  Polley said.     'No Country Has Right to Gesticulate' Protesters wearing masks of Chinese Nobel rights activist Liu Xiaobo stand outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China June 27, 2017.Bobby YipLiu was in serious condition but his life was not in immediate danger, said researcher at Amnesty International Patrick Poon, citing several sources. His wife was taking care of him in hospital, he added, but it is unclear when she learned about his disease, which was diagnosed in late May, or how long she had been by his side.  While Liu Xiaobo is on medical parole, it doesn't mean he is entirely free and he is still subject to various restrictions,  Poon said.  U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, co-chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, called in a statement on Monday for President Donald Trump to seek Liu's  immediate humanitarian transfer to the United States.  Slideshow (2 Images)Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, responding to a question about Liu, said the issue was an internal affair.  We have said many times that no country has the right to gesticulate about China's internal affairs,  Lu told a regular briefing. Asked whether China would consider allowing Liu to go abroad for treatment, Lu said:  All other countries should respect China's judicial independence and sovereignty and should not use any so-called individual case to interfere in China's internal affairs.  Wang Qiaoling, the activist wife of rights lawyers Li Heping, likened Liu's case to that of her husband and dozens of other lawyers detained in Beijing's most recent clampdown on dissent, who say they suffer illnesses due to mistreatment. Wang said some of those detained in the crackdown, which began on July 9, 2015, had  met with high blood pressure.   We suspect Mr Liu Xiaobo 'met with liver cancer', and call for an independent third-party medical organization to be involved,  she said on Twitter.  China has in the past acknowledged problems of mistreatment in the criminal justice system and has repeatedly vowed to crack down to address them. In Hong Kong, about 70 supporters of Liu took to the streets to demand his immediate release, chanting slogans denouncing the Chinese government as a  murderer.  The protesters, including prominent democracy activists Martin Lee and Joshua Wong, gathered outside Beijing's main representative office in Hong Kong, the Central Liaison Office, and plastered pictures of Liu on its gates and held up banners.  We should not be indifferent toward such blatant unfairness,  Wong said of Liu's plight. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-idUSKBN19I0C9"},

The coalition said it had carried out strikes on known IS targets in the town on Sunday and Monday - the day the Observatory said the prison was hit, killing 57 people. The coalition said the mission had been  meticulously planned  to reduce the risk of possible harm to non-combatants. It added it would assess the Observatory's allegation. Islamic State is believed to have moved most of its leadership to al-Mayadeen in Syria's Euphrates Valley, southeast of the group's besieged capital Raqqa, according to U.S. intelligence officials. Among operations moved to al-Mayadeen, about 80 km (50 miles) west of the Iraqi border, are its online propaganda operation and its limited command and control of attacks in Europe and elsewhere, they say. The Observatory said the air strike took place on Monday at dawn, hitting a building in the town of al-Mayadeen that was being used as a prison.  Separately, Syrian state-run TV station al-Ikhbariya cited its Deir al-Zor correspondent as saying coalition warplanes had destroyed a building in al-Mayadeen used as a prison by Islamic State to hold a  large number of civilians . The U.S.-led coalition is supporting an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters in their assault on Islamic State in its de facto capital of Raqqa in northern Syria.  The Coalition conducted strikes on known ISIS (Islamic State) command and control facilities and other ISIS infrastructure in (Mayadeen), Syria, June 25 and 26,  Colonel Joe Scrocca, coalition director of public affairs, said in an email to Reuters.  The removal of these facilities disrupts ISIS's ability to facilitate and provoke terrorist attacks against the coalition, our partner forces and in our homelands. This mission was meticulously planned and executed to reduce the risk of collateral damage and potential harm to non-combatants.

An estimated one in three girls in the developing world is married before the age of 18, with one girl married off every two seconds, according to experts. The World Bank said ending child marriage would reduce population growth, boost girls' educational achievements and increase their earnings.   It would also lead to women having healthier and better educated children, further boosting prosperity.  Child marriage not only puts a stop to girls' hopes and dreams, it also hampers efforts to end poverty and achieve economic growth and equity,  World Bank economist Quentin Wodon said in a statement.  Related CoverageFactbox: The hidden economic costs of child marriage Ending this practice is not only the morally right thing to do but also the economically smart thing to do,  added Wodon, who co-authored the report - the first to look at the economic impact of child marriage.  One of the biggest economic benefits of ending child marriage would derive from a reduction in population growth, according to the study co-authored by the International Center for Research on Women. Girls who marry young have more children on average than those who delay marriage.  Ending child marriage would reduce fertility rates by 11 percent on average in 15 of the worst affected countries analyzed in the study. Global gains from lower population growth could exceed $500 billion annually by 2030, with cumulative gains topping $4 trillion, the study said. Although world leaders have pledged to end child marriage by 2030 under the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals agreed in 2015, investments to end the practice remain limited. The authors said this was likely partly due to the fact child marriage was seen as a social issue and the economic case had not been made forcefully enough. Each year of secondary education reduces the risk of child marriage by five percentage points or more, the report said. Child brides are more likely to drop out of school than their peers who marry later, which in turn impacts their ability to earn a living. Early marriage reduces women's earnings in adulthood by 9 percent, the study said, while the children of child mothers tend to suffer poorer development and health.  The economic benefits of lower rates of under-five mortality and stunting - that can lead to irreversible damage to health - which would result from ending child marriage could reach more than $90 billion annually by 2030, the bank estimated.

Ending child marriage would cut population growth and boost girls' educational achievements and earning ability, boosting national prosperity, according to a report by the bank and the International Center for Research on Women.     Here are some facts: - Some 15 million girls a year are married before the age of 18 - one girl every two seconds. - Niger has the highest rate of child marriage with nearly  77 percent of girls wed before 18, followed by Chad with over 68 percent, and Mali and Bangladesh with over 59 percent.  - Although rates of child marriage have fallen, the total number of child brides continues to increase due to population growth. Impact on Population Growth  - Women who marry early tend to have more children. Ending child marriage would reduce the fertility rate by 12 percent in Nigeria, 15 percent in Ethiopia and Niger and 18 percent in Bangladesh, having significant implications for population growth. - Niger's population would fall by around 5 percent by 2030 if child marriage ended immediately, having a positive effect on national budgets and welfare.  - Lower population growth would increase GDP. If child marriage had ended in 2015, the estimated annual global benefit would be $566 billion by 2030. - The benefit would be almost $1 billion in Nepal, $1.7 billion in Niger and $4.8 billion in Ethiopia.      Child Mortality and Development - Children born to child brides are more at risk of death or poor development due to lack of good nutrition. - Three in 100 deaths among under-fives are attributable to the young age of the mother. One in 100 stunted children are stunted because of early childbirths. - The global annual benefit from ending under-five mortality and stunting would be $98 billion by 2030.  Education     - Child brides are much more likely to drop out of school, affecting their future ability to earn money.  - Child marriage reduces women's earnings by 9 percent. In Nigeria this is equivalent to $7.6 billion annually in lost earnings and productivity. - Ending child marriage could increase national earnings by an average of 1 percent. - Reducing populations would also produce big savings in national education budgets. Eliminating child marriage would save countries 5 percent or more of their education budget by 2030. Sources: World Bank, Girls Not Brides.

The Outlooks are Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. The upgrades reflect the completion of Ethias's recovery plan in May 2017 and resulting strengthening of capital profile and reduced exposure to interest rate risk. Ethias is planning further actions aimed at strengthening its capital position, although these may negatively impact profitability in 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Ethias's strong capital position, as indicated by Fitch's Prism FBM, good profitability, albeit potentially volatile, and strong franchise in Belgium. Offsetting these factors are Ethias's moderate exposure to interest rate risk, and the reliance of its parent company, Vitrufin, on Ethias for funding the payment of interest and principal on its EUR278 million debt. This is likely to exert pressure on Ethias's capital and cash flow over the next two years. On 12 May 2017 Ethias announced the completion of the recovery plan that it initiated in October 2016, following a request by the National Bank of Belgium (NBB). The plan comprised strengthening its capital position and reducing the sensitivity of its Solvency II coverage ratio to low interest rates. We expect one further measure outlined by the NBB, financial reinsurance on credit spreads of corporate bonds, to be carried out in 2017. Ethias also integrated Whestia, a small insurance subsidiary, at end-June 2017, marginally benefiting Ethias's solvency position. The recovery plan included measures to reduce Ethias's exposure to interest-rate risk associated with the capital-intensive 'First A' products, under which guarantees are paid until the policyholder reaches the age of 99. The main measure, a 'Switch VI' offer, where customers were offered a 25% premium on contract value in case of surrenders marked another step in Ethias's efforts to reduce the amount of contracts related to First A products. Since 2014, around 80% of reserves related to these products have been redeemed by policyholders. Ethias launched a new 'Switch VII' offer on 29 May 2017, offering policyholders of First A products a financial incentive to redeem their contracts. If the offer is successful, Ethias's capital profile is likely to further improve in 2017. The offer closes on 7 July 2017. In addition, Ethias is in discussion with potential buyers for the remaining part of the First A portfolio. The disposal may come at a cost, but it would contribute to significantly reducing Ethias's exposure to interest rate risk. Ethias has a strong but still volatile capital position, reflecting its exposure to interest-rate risk. At end-2016, Ethias's group regulatory Solvency II ratio was 146%, excluding transitional arrangements. It improved to 157% in 1Q17 following data enhancements. Ethias targets a Solvency II ratio of 150%. Fitch's Prism FBM score for Ethias was 'Strong' based on end-2016 data, after deduction of the Vitrufin debt (2015: 'Strong'). Ethias's financial leverage (FLR) ratio, including Vitrufin's debt, was 28% at end-2016 (2015: 33%). Vitrufin relies on Ethias for dividends to pay the interest and principal on its EUR278 million debt, which matures in January 2019. Ethias has historically pre-funded all interest expenses related to the Vitrufin debt via dividend payments that are deducted from Ethias's solvency capital. In 2018, Ethias plans to pay further dividends of EUR278 million (EUR45 million ordinary dividend on 2017 result and EUR233 million as a dividend in account on 2018 result) to Vitrufin. Ethias's IFRS net income was EUR424 million in 2016, after a profit of EUR638 million in 2015 and a significant loss in 2014 of EUR598 million. Despite the profit in 2016, Ethias's financial performance is sensitive to interest-rate changes and can be volatile. Fitch estimates that the Switch VII offer could cost Ethias up to EUR150 million, depending on the acceptance rate. Further, the announced intention to dispose the remaining First A reserves could result in a one-off loss for Ethias. This would negatively impact profitability in 2017, despite being positive for Ethias's capital profile. Ethias is exposed to interest-rate risk as life technical liabilities are subject to relatively high minimum guaranteed returns. However, Fitch views this risk to be reducing as liabilities reduce. Therefore, the agency places limited reliance on the duration gap between assets and liabilities, despite the potential for it to increase with changes in business mix. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be upgraded on redemption of Vitrufin's debt and if Ethias's Prism score remains at least  Strong , the Solvency II ratio above 150% and FLR below 25%. The ratings are likely to be downgraded if Ethias's Prism FBM falls to  Adequate  or FLR increases to above 35%.

The Uzbek government forced students, teachers and doctors to plant cotton and harvest it from 2015 to 2017, stopping children from receiving a full education, Human Rights Watch and the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights said in a report.  The quality of education at all levels is greatly undermined even when children aren't sent out to work because their teachers are sent out to work,  Jessica Evans, a Human Rights Watch researcher, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Half the time the kids are left alone because there aren't teachers in the room,  she added.     Those who refused to work on cotton fields risked being fired, expelled from school or having their welfare payments slashed, the report said. In one irrigation project funded by the World Bank spanning an area where the government had agreed to prohibit forced and child labor, researchers found children as young as 13 working in fields as well as adults who had been coerced into working. The World Bank provided almost $700 million in loans to the Uzbek government for agriculture and water projects in 2015 and 2016.  The World Bank Group does not condone forced labor in any form and takes seriously reports of incidents in the cotton sector of Uzbekistan,  a World Bank spokesperson said in response to the report.  We continue to voice our strong concerns on labor issues to the government of Uzbekistan.  Uzbek authorities could not be reached for comment. Human rights groups say Uzbekistan is concealing a state-orchestrated forced labor system that underpins its position as the world's fifth-largest cotton exporter. They cite regular arrests, intimidation and harassment of activists. This has sparked a global boycott almost 300 companies, including fashion giants such as Zara and Yves Saint Laurent, who pledged not to knowingly source Uzbek cotton until the government ends forced and child labor in the industry.  Rights groups said the systemic nature of forced labor in the Uzbek cotton industry made it highly unlikely that any company souring a significant amount of cotton from Uzbekistan was free of forced labor in their supply chain. A leading campaigner against forced labor in Uzbekistan, Elena Urlaeva, was arrested in March ahead of an international meeting where she was scheduled to give evidence on human rights violations. She was released three weeks later. One of the few independent rights defenders in Uzbekistan, Urlaeva has regularly been beaten, arrested and sexually abused by Uzbek authorities, rights groups said. In early 2017, the International Labour Organization (ILO), found that although Uzbekistan is making progress in eliminating child labor from its cotton industry, forced labor was still widespread.  ILO monitoring did not find any instances of forced or child labor in projects supported by the World Bank. Reporting by Anna Pujol-Mazzini @annapmzn, Editing by Ros Russell.

Between 2009 and 2015, a number of customers of Baltikums Bank, Privatbank and Regionala Investiciju Banka used offshore companies in Panama, Belize, Great Britain to transfer payments to North Korea, bypassing international sanctions, the regulator said.  A situation where banks are being used or indirectly end up in chains of actors evading sanctions is unacceptable,  said Peteris Putnins, head of Latvian Banking watchdog told reporters. The banks were fined for breaching rules on preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. Putnins said the internal control systems at the banks, which mainly serve non-resident clients, had been lax. Both Baltikums Bank and Privatbank said they would improve their internal control systems. Regionala Investiciju Banka said in an emailed comment to Reuters that the bank has already been working to upgrade its anti-money laundering measures in recent years, including reviewing its client base. The fines are a result of information from an ongoing investigation carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.

Draghi indicated that the central bank might tweak its stimulus so that it does not become more accommodative as the economy recovers.                  “He surprised the market with that upbeat stance,” said Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global in New York. “The European government bond market didn’t take it very well.”     Treasury yields rose in line with European bonds.                  Benchmark 10-year notes             were last down 13/32 in price to yield 2.18 percent, up from 2.14 percent late on Monday.     The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, with the gap between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                dropping to a low of 92.70 basis points. That was the flattest level since late 2007.     The difference between yields on two-year and 10-year notes                declined to 76.80 basis points, its lowest level since Sept. 2.     The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve officials including New York Fed President William Dudley indicated that further monetary policy tightening was likely.     That has led short- and intermediate-dated debt, which is more sensitive to interest rate changes, to underperform, while concerns about tepid growth and falling inflation have supported long bonds.     Longer-dated debt has also rallied as investors reach for higher yields.     Fund managers “are really defensive and believe that yields could really ratchet lower, and they’re putting money into duration,” said di Galoma.     Fed chair Janet Yellen is due to speak later on Tuesday.     San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Tuesday that central banks in the United States and other advanced economies would find themselves stuck with slow growth over the long term unless fiscal authorities do something decisive to turn things around.                  The Treasury will sell $34 billion in five-year notes on Tuesday as part of $88 billion in sales of new coupon-bearing supply this week.

Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose for a fourth consecutive session but worries over persistent oversupply capped gains.                  The U.S. dollar        fell, pressured by strength in the euro after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door to tweaks that might begin to reduce the central bank's emergency stimulus to the economy shortly.                  Escalating a trade dispute with Canada in the run-up to talks on renegotiating NAFTA, the U.S. Commerce Department on Monday imposed preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber of up to 7.72 percent.

The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3260, while it touched its strongest since June 19 at C$1.3197.     Gains for the loonie came ahead of remarks on Wednesday by Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, who will be participating in a panel discussion at the European Central Bank's Forum on Central Banking.     Data on Friday showing weaker-than-expected domestic inflation has reduced the chances of an interest rate hike next month from the Bank of Canada.

Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds.

Two former bankers at Lloyds' HBOS Reading business were among those jailed in February for their involvement in the scam, which affected 64 people, including Noel Edmonds, a TV presenter and former disc jockey. Lloyds set up a 100 million pound ($128 million) compensation scheme in April and set the end-June deadline for payment to victims hit by the fraud, which involved siphoning off money from struggling businesses. According to one source with knowledge of the matter, less than a fifth of the 64 victims have received compensation offers and only one has reached a settlement with the bank. Edmonds is seeking more than 70 million pounds in compensation for businesses he alleges were destroyed by the fraud. He has set up a website with an  honesty countdown  clock showing the time remaining for Lloyds to meet its self-imposed deadline. Lloyds on Tuesday said it now plans to make compensation offers to some customers by the end of June. Others  might need more time to provide input into the review,  it said. A bank spokesman said in an email:  Our focus is on swift, fair and appropriate compensation.  HBOS, once Britain's biggest mortgage lender under the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands, had to be rescued in a state-engineered takeover in 2008 by rival Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds subsequently needed a 20 billion pound bailout of its own after taking on HBOS. Victims of the fraud have accused the bank of dragging out the compensation process and underestimating the final amount it will have to pay.  Lloyds clearly just want to grind down its fraud victims by a process of attrition, making the process of getting recompense as difficult and frustrating as possible to force them into accepting less than their entitlement,  Jonathan Coad, a lawyer for Edmonds said. The jailed bankers pushed struggling business owners to employ a costly turnaround consultancy as a condition for receiving loans and, in some cases, hand over ownership. One of the bankers received designer watches, exotic holidays and sex with prostitutes in return for referring clients to the consultancy, evidence presented in the trial showed. The delay in compensation is adding to the stress of victims, some of whom have lost their homes or investments and had families crumble, said Nikki Turner, one of the victims who helped to uncover the fraud with husband Paul.  We were vindicated in court but it's been a bit of a Pyrrhic victory - we can't get on with our lives,  Turner told Reuters on Tuesday. $1 = 0.7847 pounds Reporting By Andrew MacAskill and Lawrence White.

There was a risk  that somehow we allow petty politics to interfere with economic logic, and we end up with a suboptimal solution that fails to maximise our mutual benefit,  he said. Hammond said that the shift from industry to services in most major economies had led to the economic marginalization of many people who now view globalization as a threat. He urged G20 leaders meeting in Hamburg next week to work toward the liberalization of trade in services.

The BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said British banks must now hold 5.7 billion pounds ($7.28 billion) between them as an additonal buffer against bad times, and that it will probably double that in November. After voters decided to leave the European Union a year ago, the FPC cut to zero a requirement that banks create an extra capital buffer as part of a broad range of stimulus measures to help the country cope with the shock. But the economy has performed more strongly than expected since the referendum, despite some recent signs of a slowdown. Some of the central banks' interest rate setters now think it is time to raise its main interest rate. BoE Governor Mark Carney said the FPC's action did not in itself imply that monetary policy was also about to tighten.  Monetary policy is the last line of defence to address financial stability issues,  Carney told a news conference.  In that regard, we don't need monetary policy to do our job. In fact, by doing our job we allow monetary policy to focus on its job which is returning inflation sustainably to target in an exceptional period.  British inflation is above the BoE's target at 2.9 percent and is set to rise higher as sterling's fall since last year's Brexit vote feeds through into prices. Carney expect this will be temporary but other policymakers say it could have a lasting impact and want to lift interest rates off their record low. The FPC declared that risks to Britain's economy from its financial system were back at a  standard  level and that banks should set more money aside in case of a future downturn. To do that, the FPC raised its counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCyB) - which rises and falls along with the ups and downs of the economy - to 0.5 percent from zero, with a one-year implementation phase. It expects to raise the buffer to 1 percent in November, the level that reflects an economy that is running normally. The BoE also said regulators would publish tighter rules on consumer lending next month and it would bring forward to September from November its checks on whether banks could cope with consumer loans losses. J.P. Morgan economist Allan Monks said the BoE's move on Tuesday was modest and probably reflected signs that consumer lending has already started to slow after growing at its fastest pace in 11 years in late 2016.  The BoE's response to the strength in consumer lending was towards the milder end of the range of potential outcomes,  he said. Bank shares fell after Tuesday's BoE announcement but quickly recovered to their levels earlier on Tuesday. Credit Worries The BoE also said it was concerned that lenders were placing too much weight on recent low losses, which could only be achieved in the current benign conditions.  As is often the case in a standard environment, there are pockets of risks that warrant vigilance,  the BoE said. Existing restrictions on high loan-to-income mortgage lending were likely to stay for the long term, the BoE said, and it also tweaked the rate against which lenders must test borrowers' ability to repay their mortgages. On Brexit, the BoE said it was continuing to oversee banks' preparations for Britain leaving the EU in 2019, including the possibility of an abrupt exit without any trade deal, potentially cutting off banks from their European customers. The BoE warned of risks from China where private-sector borrowing is more than two and a half times annual economic output.  High debt makes China vulnerable to shocks. This could affect the global economy and UK banks,  it said. It also warned that British corporate bonds and commercial real estate may be overvalued. Both had their valuations boosted by low interest rates, but these did not appear to take into account how low interest rates reflected a weak economic outlook.

(Reuters) - At a glitzy weekend gathering of donors to the powerful Koch brothers' network, much of the talk was about the conservative political group's criticism of the healthcare bill moving through the U.S. Senate. That opposition suggests billionaires Charles and David Koch, powerful players in Republican politics, remain at odds at least on some key issues with President Donald Trump, whose campaign last year they refused to back. But beyond healthcare, the Kochs and their operatives have welcomed much of the fledgling administration's actions, including efforts to roll back federal regulations, the decision to pull out of the Paris global climate accord, a Veterans Administration reform bill and the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Koch officials say their network has better access to the Trump administration than they expected given past frictions, partly because former Koch operatives have been hired in key administration jobs. “Overall, we’ve made tremendous progress on the federal level that we haven’t been able to make in the last 10 years,” said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, a Koch-backed advocacy group. Vice President Mike Pence has played a key role, meeting privately with Charles Koch on Friday, as well as Marc Short, a former member of the Koch network who is now Trump's point man in Congress.  Charles Koch, addressing more than 400 supporters gathered at The Broadmoor luxury resort in Colorado for the event, touted the progress the organization is making, particularly since the 2016 election. “When I look at where we are — at the size and effectiveness of this network — I’m blown away,” he said. “I’m more optimistic now than ever.” The Koch brothers have been a force in American politics since the 1980s. Their influence has largely been powered by a fortune centered on Koch Industries, the second-largest privately held company in the United States with annual revenues of more than $115 billion from interests in energy, chemicals and other sectors.  Both Trump and the Koch network have incentives to build warmer ties. The Kochs could end up spending hundreds of millions to preserve the Republican majority in Congress during next year’s midterm elections. Attendees to the weekend meeting had to donate at least $100,000 to be invited. Koch-funded groups such as Freedom Partners could also help build support among conservative activists for tax reform and other Trump administration agenda items. Mutual Wariness During the 2016 campaign, the Kochs kept their distance from Trump. Charles Koch spoke out against Trump's proposed Muslim registry, invoking a comparison to Nazi Germany. The network did not actively work to defeat Trump during the Republican primary. But when he secured the nomination, the group did not spend money backing him or criticizing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. By contrast, the Koch network spent more than $120 million in the 2012 election to defeat President Barack Obama.     For his part, Trump lumped the Kochs in with other special-interest groups, boasting that he did not need their money and that they could not influence him. U.S. President Donald Trump addresses a joint news conference with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 26, 2017.Kevin LamarqueBut the Koch network began showing its clout in the spring when it worked with the White House to push the House of Representatives healthcare bill in a more conservative direction.     Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch advocacy group, teamed with Pence and Short, Trump’s legislative affairs director, to help get the measure through the House.     Pence is viewed as a trusted friend of the Koch network, dating to his time as a congressman.     At the meeting with Charles Koch on Friday they discussed healthcare and tax reform, Phillips and other Koch aides said.      Short is a former Pence aide and Koch alumni, having run the Koch political organization that became Freedom Partners. Stephen Ford, a speechwriter for Pence, has worked for Freedom Partners.     Koch operatives were encouraged when the White House recently cooled to the idea of a tax on imports, the so-called “border adjustment tax” advocated by House Speaker Paul Ryan.     Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners mounted a media and public-pressure campaign against the border tax. Phillips has met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the issue. Mnuchin’s chief of staff, Eli Miller, served as the Ohio director of AFP.     Mnuchin has since come out against the tax in meetings with members of Congress, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina said at the donor retreat.     On the veterans bill, Koch group Concerned Veterans of America was able to work with one of their own. Darin Selnick, a former senior adviser to that group, is now a top aide to Trump’s Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin.     That group is working with the White House on the more than 130 federal judicial vacancies Trump must fill, partnering with conservative legal advocate Leonard Leo, who has become a trusted Trump adviser on the issue.     Leo joined Charles Koch on stage at a donor event on Saturday night. A Koch group,  Concerned Veterans of America, mounted a grassroots campaign to secure Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.     Yet some stark policy differences remain between the Kochs and the Trump administration.     The Kochs, who are proponents of criminal justice reform, are frustrated with the Department of Justice's effort to crack down on low-level drug offenders. They also disagree with Trump's hardline immigration stance.     Asked about the Koch network’s successes, a White House aide did not expressly address the network’s goals, but said Trump “has already made tremendous progress toward making our country prosperous and safe again.”     In interviews with attendees at the donor summit, opinions on Trump were mixed, but even some critics found reason to praise the administration. Several mentioned Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, an advocate of charter schools and vouchers.     Other attendees were effusive in their praise of Trump’s actions so far.     “He's walks the walk,” said Al Hartman, CEO of a property management firm in Houston. “He's doing exactly what everyone wants done.” Reporting By James Oliphant; Editing by Caren Bohan and Cynthia Osterman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-koch-idUSKBN19I137"},

By Jamie McGeever LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - Only a year after throwing caution to the wind to shore up the UK economy following the shock Brexit referendum result, the Bank of England is in a bind. At the centre of the problem is the exchange rate. Sterling's plunge since the Brexit vote is fueling the highest inflation in four years. But that very inflation is eroding earnings, squeezing consumers and hampering growth. If the Bank keeps policy loose to ride out the economic slowdown, it risks triggering another slide in sterling and subsequent jump in inflation. If on the other hand it tightens to curb inflation, it risks hitting consumers and homeowners where it hurts. Or maybe there's a third way. The Bank's Financial Policy Committee on Tuesday raised capital requirements for UK banks to tackle the growing risk of lax lending, forcing them to set aside an extra 11.4 billion pounds. This could be increased in November, the Bank said.  Consumer credit has been growing much faster than household incomes,  the BoE said, adding that there were  pockets of risks that warrant vigilance.  The consumer also figures prominently in the sudden shift of sentiment on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee that has made an interest rate hike more likely than at any time in a decade. Annual inflation is 2.9 percent, well above the Bank's 2 percent target and unnerving a growing number of policymakers that it could spiral out of control. Economists at Nomura even think the BoE will raise rates at its next meeting in August. But where are these inflationary pressures coming from? Wage growth has for years undershot the Bank's expectations and the economy is slowing as Brexit gets underway. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reckons the UK economy will grow 1 percent next year, the lowest growth of all 32 countries in its global outlook bar one. If the OECD is right, Britain will be the only one of these 32 countries to post slowing growth over the four years 2014-2018. Few observers see strong domestic inflation pressures. Sole Driver Although the world economy is in its rudest health for six years, global inflation is low too. The global price of oil has fallen 20 percent in the last two months to around $45 a barrel. If oil prices stay where they are, some measures of headline U.S. and euro zone consumer price inflation will likely be below 1 percent early next year, predict economists at Citi. Ultimately, the Bank of England's inflation worries come down to one thing: sterling. The narrow 5-3 vote to keep rates on hold at the last MPC meeting and chief economist Andy Haldane's Damascene conversion last week to consider voting for higher rates show that the exchange rate is the key variable in setting policy. Haldane estimated that the currency's 3 percent fall since the Bank's May Inflation Report would mechanically add around 0.2 percentage points to growth and inflation over the next two to three years. The BoE doesn't specifically target the exchange rate, and policymakers do their best to avoid commenting on it publicly. But while they'd never say it, the last thing they want is another wave of depreciation that will lift the cost of imports and inflation even higher. For example, a slide to $1.20 in the coming months from $1.27 currently isn't a far-fetched scenario. It would represent a fall of nearly 6 percent, adding a further 0.4 percentage points to inflation over the coming years, by Haldane's metrics. The British public's longer-term inflation expectations for the next five to 10 years rose to 3.1 percent in June from 3.0 percent in May, Citi said last week. That's close to February's peak of 3.2 percent. Another sterling slide would probably result in a new high. The Bank refrained from raising rates when inflation hit 5 percent in 2011, when the post-crisis recovery was fragile and in its infancy. Now, the global economy and banking system is in better shape, so a policy response to inflation is more likely. The BoE's problem is exacerbated by the yield curve. Yields are falling and the curve is its flattest since October. With stock markets rising - the FTSE 100 hit a record high this month - financial conditions are easing, not tightening. A stable or higher exchange rate will help offset that and bring inflation back to target. So policymakers will be quietly happy that since the MPC's 5-3 vote split on June 15, sterling has been well behaved in a fairly narrow range of $1.26-$1.28.

In a statement following a review of U.S. economic policies, the IMF said the Trump administration's push for annual growth of over 3 percent for a sustained period was unlikely to be achieved partly because the labor market is already at a level consistent with full employment. The IMF in April had forecast U.S. growth of 2.3 percent for 2017 and 2.5 percent for 2018, based partly on gains from expected tax cuts and new federal spending. But given the lack of details on the U.S. administration's  still evolving policy plans  the IMF said it decided to remove the assumed stimulus from its forecasts. The IMF said the Trump administration's latest budget plans would place a disproportionate share of spending cuts onto low- and middle-income households, adding  this would appear counter to the budget's goals of promoting safety and prosperity for all Americans.  Instead, the Fund suggested a tax policy that would improve the federal revenue-to-GDP ratio, more balanced cuts that strengthen the social safety net's efficiency, and efforts to contain healthcare cost inflation.

Yellen is scheduled to take part in a discussion on global economic issues in London at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). Investors expect Yellen to offer more insight into the state of the U.S. economy, which would support the Fed's forecast of a rate hike this year.

The latest figure, which reflects a reduction in swaps notional equivalent to US$1,000trn, or 13 times global GDP, comes after banks embraced compression in response to stringent leverage ratio treatment under Basel III, tearing up superfluous contracts to slim down bloated derivatives portfolios. Compression, which involves matching identical and offsetting trades between clients and netting them down into fewer line items, emerged as a vital activity following the 2009 G20 agreement, which aimed to reduce systemic risk through new swaps reporting and clearing requirements under Dodd-Frank in the US and EMIR in Europe. That has piled additional pressure on dealers and buyside firms to eliminate unnecessary swap inventory as they cut the operational burden associated with unwieldy swaps books. Notional outstanding of OTC swaps fell to US$483trn by the end of 2016, down from a US$707trn peak in 2011, according to the Bank for International Settlements, and largely driven by compression. “Hitting the US$1 quadrillion mark is a significant achievement for the market,” said Peter Weibel, CEO of triReduce. “Our clients, both dealers and the buyside, are focused on eliminating as much notional principal as possible to meet regulatory goals and to manage their own balance sheets.” Innovation Although operational for 14 years, the volume of swaps eliminated through triReduce tripled in 2014 as the service added more cycles in conjunction with swaps clearinghouse LCH SwapClear. The platform now runs up to 200 cycles each year alongside six central counterparty clearinghouses, with more still to come onboard. LCH hit its own US$1 quadrillion compression landmark a year ago through a combination of triReduce cycles and its own unilateral service and blended-rate compression, which enables trades with different interest rates to be collapsed. The process of unlinking trades was added to the triReduce service in 2014, increasing matching rates by enabling contracts to be eliminated without an agreement from the opposite party. Matching was increased by another 20% in 2015 with the introduction of upscaling, which enables counterparties to increase the notional amount of an existing trade to trigger a match and associated tear-up that might not otherwise emerge. While cleared swaps represent the bulk of compression activity, growth has been high in non-cleared contracts such as cross-currency swaps, which now attract hefty collateral requirements under uncleared swaps margin rules that went live in 2016 for the first wave of participants. TriReduce compresses across 28 currencies in interest rates swaps, credit default swaps, FX forwards and commodity swaps.

Trading in off-the-runs has declined in recent years as post-financial crisis regulations requiring banks to hold more capital led to a decline in market making for the securities, which comprise 98 percent of the $13.8 trillion U.S. Treasury market but less than one-third of average daily volumes. OpenDoor's auctions bring together buyers and sellers including central banks, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, primary dealers, asset managers, hedge funds and trading firms.

In a speech to the Association of British Insurers, Barclay, whose official title is Economic Secretary to the Treasury, sought to reassure banks and insurers that he was qualified for the job. His predecessor, Simon Kirby, was stripped of his role in overseeing the industry's preparations for Brexit after banks worried he had too little experience in finance.  Prior to becoming an MP (member of parliament), I worked in both the insurance and banking sectors, and at the City regulator. I plan to bring that industry focus to bear in discussions within Whitehall and beyond,  Barclay said. He also sought to calm worries that government was not hearing the sector's concerns about Brexit - lenders said last year their concerns were falling on deaf ears.  I know that my job will involve a great deal of listening to your concerns, and indeed your ideas for growth and investment,  Barclay said.  But it will also be about showing you that we’re acting on what you tell us.  Apart from securing access to the EU's single market after Brexit, banks and insurers in the UK want to continue hiring staff from outside Britain. Barclay said the British people understand the importance of businesses being able to access global talent and to move individuals around their organisations.  The concerns on immigration expressed during last year’s referendum were not about insurers bringing in the skills they need to keep their businesses at the cutting edge,  he said. Catastrophe Bonds Barclay said Britain will be on track to become a centre for insurance-linked securities such as catastrophe bonds later this year. Britain's insurance industry has been pushing to set up a catastrophe bond market to take on rival centres such as Bermuda, which already have regulations in place to allow the repackaging of large risks like hurricane insurance as debt instruments.  The regulations are now being finalised so they can be laid in parliament before the summer recess, with a view to the regime coming into force in the autumn of this year,  Barclay said in a letter to lobby group the London Market Group (LMG). Catastrophe bonds other insurance-linked securities are popular investments for pension funds due to their high yield compared with traditional asset classes. Catastrophe bond issuance totalled $5.8 billion in 2016, according to broker Aon Benfield.  We hope this partnership with government sets a strong precedent for other initiatives and growing its share of the global market,  said Malcolm Newman, chairman of the LMG's ILS taskforce.

The moves - almost two years after the Volkswagen scandal broke - come as the German government faces growing pressure ahead of national elections on Sept. 24 to reduce emissions or see some cities ban diesel cars themselves. On Monday, Reuters reported the transport ministry was pushing carmakers to update engine management software to cut pollution in up to 12 million diesel vehicles in the country, citing people familiar with the talks. On Tuesday, the transport ministry and the environment ministry announced the creation of a  national diesel forum  to work with the auto industry and regional governments to cut emissions, with the first meeting set for Aug. 2.  We want emissions to fall across Germany,  Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said in a statement. Dobrindt, a member of the Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, has come under fire for being close to the country's powerful car industry and for not doing enough to combat vehicle pollution.  Government sources told Reuters on Monday the software update could cost 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion to $2.8 billion), but HSBC analysts said hardware might be needed that could mean costs of up to 10 billion euros. Sales of diesel cars have been falling since the Volkswagen scandal, but have dropped even faster since cities, including Stuttgart and Munich, have considered banning some diesel vehicles, blaming emissions for increased respiratory disease. Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks, a member of the center-left Social Democrats that are Merkel's junior coalition partners, said the diesel forum was an opportunity for carmakers to win back lost trust and improve air quality. More Transparent Tests? Demonstrators protest against pollution from diesel vehicles in front of the Transport ministry in Berlin, Germany, June 27, 2017 .Rene WagnerSeparately, the transport ministry said it was setting up a new institute to ensure  more transparency and reliability  in vehicle tests, involving consumer organizations, local governments and environmental groups, as well as the auto industry and ministries. However, the KBA motor vehicle authority, which reports to the transport ministry and currently oversees vehicle testing, will remain responsible for licensing new models.  The ministry said the new institute would test about 70 car models a year using realistic driving scenarios, rather than relying solely on laboratory conditions, and the emissions and fuel consumption results would be made public to allow car buyers to make better comparisons. It noted that current official tests do not take into account factors such as the use of air conditioning and radio, or the weather or style of driving, which all influence fuel consumption. Germany's VDA auto industry association said in a statement its members were keen to give customers more information about variance in fuel efficiency and would fully participate in the new institute in the interests of more transparency. However, the environmentalist Greens questioned how independent the new institute would be given the car industry is set to pay its annual budget of 2 million euros. In the aftermath of the Volkswagen scandal, the German transport ministry ordered tests on the carbon dioxide emissions of 29 models. On Tuesday, it said 17 passed the test, while 10 models still needed to be tested in the coming months. However, some versions of an Opel Zafira car and a Smart For Two produced by Daimler emitted more carbon dioxide than they should, although the Smart model still needed to undergo further tests. Both versions of the models in question are now discontinued. Zafira diesels already on the road will have to undergo a software update, the ministry said, although the licenses for both vehicles will not be withdrawn.  Opel said the Zafira had passed all legal tests, noting fewer than 3,800 of the model in question had been sold in Germany.

The moves - almost two years after the Volkswagen scandal broke - come as the German government faces growing pressure ahead of national elections on Sept. 24 to reduce emissions or see some cities ban diesel cars themselves. On Monday, Reuters reported the transport ministry was pushing carmakers to update engine management software to cut pollution in up to 12 million diesel vehicles in the country, citing people familiar with the talks. On Tuesday, the transport ministry and the environment ministry announced the creation of a  national diesel forum  to work with the auto industry and regional governments to cut emissions, with the first meeting set for Aug. 2.  We want emissions to fall across Germany,  Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said in a statement. Dobrindt, a member of the Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, has come under fire for being close to the country's powerful car industry and for not doing enough to combat vehicle pollution.  Government sources told Reuters on Monday the software update could cost 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion to $2.8 billion), but HSBC analysts said hardware might be needed that could mean costs of up to 10 billion euros. Sales of diesel cars have been falling since the Volkswagen scandal, but have dropped even faster since cities, including Stuttgart and Munich, have considered banning some diesel vehicles, blaming emissions for increased respiratory disease. Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks, a member of the center-left Social Democrats that are Merkel's junior coalition partners, said the diesel forum was an opportunity for carmakers to win back lost trust and improve air quality. More Transparent Tests? Demonstrators protest against pollution from diesel vehicles in front of the Transport ministry in Berlin, Germany, June 27, 2017 .Rene WagnerSeparately, the transport ministry said it was setting up a new institute to ensure  more transparency and reliability  in vehicle tests, involving consumer organizations, local governments and environmental groups, as well as the auto industry and ministries. However, the KBA motor vehicle authority, which reports to the transport ministry and currently oversees vehicle testing, will remain responsible for licensing new models.  The ministry said the new institute would test about 70 car models a year using realistic driving scenarios, rather than relying solely on laboratory conditions, and the emissions and fuel consumption results would be made public to allow car buyers to make better comparisons. It noted that current official tests do not take into account factors such as the use of air conditioning and radio, or the weather or style of driving, which all influence fuel consumption. Germany's VDA auto industry association said in a statement its members were keen to give customers more information about variance in fuel efficiency and would fully participate in the new institute in the interests of more transparency. However, the environmentalist Greens questioned how independent the new institute would be given the car industry is set to pay its annual budget of 2 million euros. In the aftermath of the Volkswagen scandal, the German transport ministry ordered tests on the carbon dioxide emissions of 29 models. On Tuesday, it said 17 passed the test, while 10 models still needed to be tested in the coming months. However, some versions of an Opel Zafira car and a Smart For Two produced by Daimler emitted more carbon dioxide than they should, although the Smart model still needed to undergo further tests. Both versions of the models in question are now discontinued. Zafira diesels already on the road will have to undergo a software update, the ministry said, although the licenses for both vehicles will not be withdrawn.  Opel said the Zafira had passed all legal tests, noting fewer than 3,800 of the model in question had been sold in Germany. European governments have promoted diesel cars as part of efforts to fight climate change as they produce less carbon dioxide than petrol cars, although environmental groups have cast doubt over how much less they produce and have focused instead on the levels of toxic nitrogen oxides they emit.

The seminar, jointly sponsored by MSCI and China's two stock exchanges, was held days after the global index publisher decided to include 222 China  A-shares  into its emerging markets benchmark. The inclusion would help prop up the value of China's quality blue-chips, and would help stabilize its stock market, Fang said in his speech, a transcript of which was posted on CSRC's website. In an effort to reduce policy uncertainty,  related departments of CSRC should set up regulator communication channels with international institutional investors, constantly listen to their needs, and give timely feedback to their opinions , Fang said. In addition, the CSRC would make it easier for global investors to allocate their assets into A-shares, by making adjustment accordingly, to the quota and capital flow mechanisms of major cross-border investment channels, including the  Connect  links, and the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme, Fang said. However, CSRC and MSCI agreed during the negotiations, that overseas derivative products based on China indexes must be created on the basis of effective cross-border supervision.  Regarding the pre-approval of derivative products, we've made clear two baselines: first, they cannot harm China's financial stability; Second, main liquidity of key derivative products must stay in China,  Fang said, admitting such a practise does not confirm to international norms.  To such a big country as China, financial and economic stability is of paramount importance ... China will work with various parties to write new rules that fit globalisation in economics and finance.

{"news_time":"2017-06-27 08:28:00","news_title":"Philippine leader appears in public as rumors of health woes swirl","keywords":"Philippines,Christopher ","sector":"World","content":"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte reappeared in public on Tuesday after an absence of a week, his longest disappearance from the spotlight as president, amid concerns about his health that the government insists are baseless. Duterte gave a speech at the presidential palace of about 25 minutes late on Tuesday, during which he railed at Islamist militants for their bloody occupation of a southern town, but made no mention of why he had been absent from the public eye. Known for a busy schedule and lengthy speeches often several times a day, the 72-year-old Duterte's low profile this month has fueled rumors he is in declining health and that the government is trying to keep that under wraps. What has created most intrigue is Duterte being largely missing during what is the biggest crisis of his year-old presidency, as the military battles for a sixth week to defeat Islamic State-linked rebels currently occupying Marawi City on his home island of Mindanao. Answering queries from reporters about Duterte's long absences, his spokesman, Ernesto Abella, said he was well and running the country as normal.   He is very well, he's just busy doing what he needs to do,  he said. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte gesture as he addresses Filipino-Muslim leaders during an Eid al-Fitr celebration at the Malacanang Presidential Palace in Metro Manila, Philippines June 27, 2017.Romeo Ranoco As you've seen he's been very much in the public eye but being out of the public eye, that is when he is able to do office work, he signs papers, he reads, he consults, he's actually very busy.  The thing that is very important to note is that he is on top of every situation, he is aware of what's happening, he's updated regularly, he reads, he listens and he's quite aware. This is just his working style.  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte gesture as he addresses Filipino-Muslim leaders during an Eid al-Fitr celebration at the Malacanang Presidential Palace in Metro Manila, Philippines June 27, 2017.Romeo RanocoDuterte was last seen on June 20 in two cities close to the violence-torn Marawi, visiting soldiers and evacuees. That followed a three-day absence after a speech in which he said his health was  immaterial , amid raised eyebrows about his failure to appear in public for Independence Day on June 12. Duterte's known ailments include back problems, migraines due to nerve damage after a motorcycle accident and Barrett's oesophagus, which impacts his throat. He also suffers from Buerger's disease, caused by his heavy smoking in younger days, which can cause blockages in the blood vessels. His office has recently said he has been experiencing fatigue. His closest aide, Christopher  Bong  Go, on June 15 posted images on social media of Duterte signing documents and standing in front of a television showing a news bulletin, adding further fuel to rumors that something was wrong.

Investors representing 65.52 percent of Stada's equity signed up for the bid, below a 67.5 percent threshold, despite the 49 percent premium offered by the buyout groups to trump a rival offer from private equity duo Advent and Permira. The new offer is unlikely to see the price increased, but may come with a lower acceptance threshold, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter isn't public.      Before launching a new bid, however, Bain and Cinven want irrevocable commitments from investors that they will tender their shares, the sources said.     Any new bid launched within a year would need recommendation from Stada's executive and supervisory boards and approval by financial watchdog Bafin, as German takeover rules otherwise bar Bain and Cinven from amending their offer a second time. The buyout groups made an initial proposal of 58 euros per share before tabling their 66 euros per share bid in April. The sources said investors such as hedge funds held back some of their shares, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock after a successful initial tender offer. But the buyout groups also struggled to galvanize non-professional, often elderly investors, many of whom the bidders feared were ignoring or forgetting letters from their custodian banks. A relatively large 27 percent of shares are held by retail investors. Index tracking funds that cannot tender initially but only after a successful deal hold about 12 percent of the stock. Lowering the acceptance hurdle too far under any new offer would complicate the buyers' efforts to get debt financing for the deal because the German takeover code requires at least 75 percent ownership for full access to a target company's cash, which could then be used to back the borrowing. Cinven declined to comment, while Bain was not immediately available for comment.  Stada shares, which touched a record high last month, fell to 56.51 euros, their lowest level since April, but later trimmed their losses to trade around 3 percent lower. Bain and Cinven had offered 66 euros per share. While former counterbidders Advent and Permira remain interested in Stada, they are not expected to take immediate action to put together a new bid, but will wait to see if Bain and Cinven launch a second attempt, people close to the matter said. Advent and Permira declined to comment.  We had been expecting the deal to go through as we had viewed the offer as a great deal for shareholders, so we view this as a significant setback,  Jefferies analyst James Vane-Tempest wrote, who has a  hold  rating on Stada shares. Many buyout firms are flush with cash after recent divestments and amid cheap borrowing costs. They are particularly attracted to healthcare assets for their reliable cash flows and resistance to swings in the business cycle.

However, we also regard this decision as a mark of confidence in Stada’s abilities, which our employees have impressively demonstrated, in particular over the past months.    Stada said the termination of the deal did not have an impact on its earnings targets. For 2017, Stada still expects sales adjusted for currency and portfolio effects of 2.28 billion to 2.35 billion euros, with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 430 million to 450 million euros.

Most economists expect the currency transition to be smooth with foreign reserves solid, the dirham balanced and public finances improved by lower global oil prices that eased the cost of energy imports. The central bank late last year said the first stages of a gradual move from currency controls to a flexible exchange rate would be implemented in the second half of 2017, along with other reforms like inflation targeting. Central Bank Governor Abdellatif Jouahri has said he will release the start date by the end of June, but denied that floating the currency will be a devaluation, in a statement in response to market speculation before the announcement. Foreign reserves have dropped $4.4 billion in the last two months. Foreign exchange reserves are at 218.5 billion dirham ($22.38 billion), according to central bank data, 2.3 percent lower than a week ago and 10.8 percent below a year ago. 'Winners and Losers' Morocco's departure from a soft peg means  a more flexible regime to support gradual opening of the domestic economy,  Ales Bulir, an IMF researcher, said at a forum on the reform.  Morocco has gone through 20 years to prepare for floating the currency,  he said, though he recognized the transition will create  new winners and losers.  The dirham is fixed via a peg that is 60 percent weighted to the euro and 40 percent to the dollar. The first stage will ease that peg to allow the currency to trade in a narrow range, which will expand gradually over a few years. How far the first stage will open the currency is unclear. Sources last year said trading fluctuation will widen by 2.5 percent each way, from 0.6 percent, expanding to fully remove the peg in a process that could take up to 15 years, depending on the market response. In parallel, the central bank is expected to introduce hard currency interbank trading and would intervene on a regular basis using the foreign reserves to ensure liquidity. Egypt abandoned its currency peg in November and shifted to a flexible exchange rate regime, a move that accompanied a $12-billion IMF loan. That sent the cost of living soaring as the Egyptian pound's value halved. But Morocco has done more than other North African countries to adopt economic reforms, curbing its deficit, ending fuel subsidies and freezing public sector hiring. Still, the currency liberalisation is a major step and one the kingdom wants to adopt gradually, wary of unrest, like the riots over food prices that followed IMF-backed reforms in the 1980s. Ratings agencies and the IMF have said Morocco's gradual approach and economic fundamentals meant the dirham was unlikely to see any drastic fall. 'Recipe for Success' After its board meeting, Morocco's central bank revised its projection of foreign exchange reserves downward, but said reserves were at levels to cover six months of imports in 2017 and close to this level by the end of 2018. Aleksander Berentsen, a University of Basel professor of economic theory, said Morocco's macro-economic stability meant it was a good moment to liberalise the dirham and the central bank was in a position to adjust to changes.  It's a recipe for success,  Berentsen said. Ahead of the announcement of the date for the first phase, traders were preparing to be ready by June 30, which some sources with knowledge of the process say is when the interbank market system will go live. But anticipation over the flexible exchange rate has some currency traders in the Casablanca bourse concerned, especially over the transparency of public institutions and economic data.  Our main concern is access to reliable macroeconomic data, and more generally, transparency,  said one trader. Last month, Morocco's foreign exchange regulator released its monthly trade deficit numbers nearly two weeks later than usual, in one case cited by traders.  This is Morocco, we're used to delays,  a trader said.  I don't believe officials have done enough to explain to the general public why we're doing this.

The Joint European Torus (JET) project, located in southeast England at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, studies the potential of fusion power as a low-carbon energy source for future generations. It is currently the only operational fusion experiment which is capable of producing fusion energy and is collectively used by more than 40 European laboratories. Britain's contract to maintain and run the JET project is managed by the UK Atomic Energy Authority and is due to end in Dec. 2018. Britain's decision to leave Euratom, the EU's framework for nuclear energy safety and development, when it leaves the bloc, has raised concerns about future funding of collaborative nuclear research projects. The government said it was willing to underwrite its share of JET's running costs until the end of 2020 if the EU extends Britain's contract to host the facility.  The UK's commitment to continue funding the facility will apply should the EU approve extending the UK’s contract to host the facility until 2020,  the government said in a statement.  A discussion will then take place on the appropriate funding split,  it added. Under the current funding arrangements, the EU currently provides around 60 million pounds ($77 million) a year, which is around 88 percent of JET's running costs.

Speaking to a conference in Portugal, Draghi said the central bank could adjust its policy tools of sub-zero interest rates and massive bond purchases as economic prospects improve in Europe. But any change in the bank's stance should be gradual as  considerable  monetary support is still needed and the rebound in inflation will also depend on favourable global financing conditions, he added. That sounded to investors, however, that he was ready to give more ground on German demands that the ECB start reducing the volume of extra euros it is feeding monthly into the economy. The euro surged as Draghi spoke, rising as much as half a percent on the day to $1.1277, its highest level since Jun. 14, up nearly 1 percent on the day. Draghi also hinted at a willingness to look through some of the factors holding down price growth, which Martin Arnold, currency strategist with ETF Securities in London, said was what the market was reacting to.  However, he's got a track record of keeping the stimulus in place so when you've got a market that's positioned ... for euro longs, we're just concerned that there's more downside risk to the euro than upside because it could unwind pretty quick if action doesn't follow the rhetoric,  Arnold said. The single currency's strength pulled the dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, to an eight-day low of 96.846, more than half a percent lower on the day. The greenback recovered some ground against the Japanese yen however, up 0.1 percent at 111.910 yen, and off a five-week high of 112.075 hit in Asian trading. Investors were awaiting speeches by Federal Reserve officials for signs on whether the central bank will stick to its guns and raise rates this year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen addresses the British Academy in London at 1700 GMT, less than two hours after an address by Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in the same city at 1515 GMT. Fed officials have signalled they will look through a slowdown in inflation and continue on their current trajectory of interest rate hikes - though investors are sceptical and market pricing shows only a 40 percent chance of a rise at the Fed's December meeting. A positive view from Yellen despite a recent batch of weak U.S. economic data would support the Fed's forecast for another rise in policy rates this year.  A notion increasingly shared in the market ... is that the Fed is continuing to normalize monetary policy regardless of more muted inflation developments,  said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist with Credit Agricole in London.  This suggests that the market-based rate expectations have additional room of adjusting to the upside should this notion become even a bigger one.  Sterling was up 0.3 percent at $1.2756, staying broadly unchanged after the Bank of England tightened capital controls on banks in Britain.

Despite a near-zero interest rate environment, financial firms continued to strengthen in the first half of 2017 due to stronger economic growth boosted by low unemployment and an expansion of consumer spending, the central bank said in its semi-annual financial stability report.  With that, an assessment of the systemic risks to the economy shows that financial institutions and households continue to be exposed to the risk of a possibility that there may be a sharp decline in home prices,  it said. Housing credit and credit to the construction and real estate industry as a share of total domestic credit to the non-financial private sector increased to some 52 percent in 2016 from about 37 percent in 2008, although the growth rate moderated significantly in the past year, the bank said.  The risk is increasing in view of the large exposure to non-housing consumer credit, which is highly correlated to housing credit,  the central bank report said.  In the event of a shock leading to a sharp increase in the interest rate or a significant negative impact to borrowers’ income, with a sharp decline in home prices, it may have an effect on the stability of the financial system, and particularly the banking system within it.  The central bank noted that there has been some moderation in housing market activity of late limiting price gains, a decline in the volume of residential housing transactions and a decrease in the amount of mortgages issued.  A continuation of the apparent moderation in activity in the real estate market and in the pace of housing price increases in recent months will lead to a decline in the risk level of the financial system,  the report said. But the continued significant increase in non-housing credit to households may expose the financial system to credit risks on the part of households, especially as a new reform to increase competition in credit supply is being implemented, it added. The central bank believes the reform will change the structure of the market and may sharply boost credit to households and debt repayments. Another possible risk to the system could come from the bond market in the wake of yield spreads on corporate bonds continuing to drop to all-time lows.  High corporate bond prices expose the financial system to a greater risk of a turnaround in the trend accompanied by a sharp decline in prices,  the bank report said.

The government of Nigeria's fast-growing mega-city of 23 million in October announced its intention to demolish all waterfront communities, home to around 300,000 people, for public safety. Residents and rights groups say this was an excuse to help a local businessman get rid of a settlement that had existed for decades so he could build more skyscrapers, hotels and malls. Steve Ayorinde, the Lagos state commissioner for information told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Tuesday the government would appeal last week's court ruling that deemed demolitions of the waterfront Otodo Gbame settlements  unconstitutional .  The Lagos state government will exercise its constitutional right to appeal a judgment that we do not agree with,  he said in a phone message. A Lagos government statement on Monday said the court erred in its ruling that the demolitions were illegal because  there was no demolition in Otodo Gbame before the case was filed.   There was a fire in Otodo Gbame caused by a violent clash between two rival cult groups. The fire destroyed the community with no residents and property remaining because the burned shanties were built with corrugated sheets, woods and bamboos,  the statement read. Governor Akinwunmi Ambode visited the community after the incident and stopped reconstruction of the shanties, the statement said, directing those living on the waterfront to leave  for security reasons . The High Court issued its ruling on June 21 after a case against the demolitions was launched by the Lagos-based human rights group, Justice and Empowerment Initiative. (JEI) Justice Adeniyi Onigbanjo ruled the rights of the residents had been violated and ordered that the state government stop further evictions and discuss resettlement. Campaigners hailed the ruling as a vindication for poorer residents, whose prime land in Nigeria's biggest city is being cleared to make way for luxury developments. One man was shot dead and another wounded when the Lagos state police launched the fourth wave of forced removals from the waterfront communities in April. Weeks after the government announced plans to demolish the slums last year, bulldozers escorted by police arrived after midnight and destroyed dwellings, forcing residents to flee into their canoes and leaving an estimated 30,000 without shelter. JEI co-executive director and lawyer, Megan Chapman said most had moved in with friends or relatives, although many were still living in their canoes or in the open air.

Make no mistake, it is not going to be easy, there is no guarantee of success,  he added, calling it the  most complex  round in the series of talks. The talks in Crans-Montana will continue as long as needed, he said, though the United Nations's current plans envisioned the session lasting until July 7, he added.  Divided in a 1974 Turkish invasion that was triggered by an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece, mediators say the two sides have come closer than ever but have left the hard parts until last.

The two sides have also been diametrically opposed on security, especially the presence of about 30,000 Turkish troops in northern Cyprus.   One side puts more emphasis on the security of community, because of a sense of being the smaller community numerically, and the other side puts more emphasis on security of state,  he said.

Britain, which has military bases on the island, is offering to give up about half of its land as part of a deal. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in a statement that with political will, creativity and flexibility, a deal could be done.

Attempts to replicate hedge fund returns by allocating to alternative sources of beta, such as momentum, value, volatility and quality, has become almost mainstream in equity investments since Danish pension fund PKA applied the approach to its entire equity portfolio in 2012. Around US$500bn is invested in equity risk factor funds, but investors are finding the diversification benefits to be amplified by applying the strategy on a cross-asset basis.  I think it’s a logical next step,  said Stan Verhoeven, co-lead portfolio manager for multi-asset factor investing at NN Investment Partners.  If you believe in the drivers behind factor investing and the drivers behind the return, which is a reward for risk based on behavioural biases or as a result of market structure, they extend to all asset classes so it makes sense if you apply it in multiple asset classes.  The investment firm has attracted US$125m to its Multi Asset Factor Opportunities fund since launch in February 2016. The fund allocates to value, carry, momentum, flow and volatility factors across equity, fixed income, FX and commodities. The fund has returned 16.4% on an annualised basis since inception, with all factors positively contributing, outperforming a traditional 60/40 bond/equity split that returned 10.21%.  It's really a true diversifier and less exposed to major market events than standard equity and fixed income investments,  said Verhoeven.  We had strong performance during the weeks before Brexit and all subsequent weeks after as you benefit from other sources of return that are driven by other return drivers.  MSCI World outperformed the strategy over the same period, delivering more than 17% on an annualised basis but with higher volatility and a larger maximum drawdown. Gains in the multi-asset factor fund were concentrated in the two months around the Brexit vote - a period when MSCI World and Barclays Global Aggregate bond index were little changed. Verhoeven puts that down to the diversification, which can drive performance over short periods compared to equity-only factors that target long-term performance given periods of underperformance that can last for multiple years.  Each individual factor should perform over the long term, but if you combine uncorrelated factors properly there's a huge diversification benefit that can provide very attractive returns in a shorter timeframe,  said Verhoeven.  That's truly the power of factor investing.  Based on indices rather than single stocks, the fund invests in liquid derivatives such as futures on 10-year government bonds and futures on 22 commodities included in the Bloomberg Commodity Index. While factors exist across all asset classes, funds typically have limitations due to liquidity constraints. The flow factor, for example is only applied to equity and commodities in the NN fund, given the high transaction costs associated with a short-term reversal strategy. Volatility is offered only in equities as the strategy, which sees investors go structurally short VIX futures, can only be replicated across other asset classes though the index options market, requiring regular delta hedging that can be costly and operationally cumbersome.  When an event happens, volatility tends to jump up in all asset classes and you lose money across all asset classes, so we're still discussing whether the costs outweigh the diversification benefit,  said Verhoeven. The fund has a total capacity of around US$2.5bn without any material changes, according to Verhoeven. That is limited by liquidity in fixed income futures and less liquid commodities such as lean hogs. Any increase above that would require scaling back in less liquid markets, and a shift into the more liquid over-the-counter swaps market for fixed income investments.

The risks were on full display on Tuesday when shares in Debenhams (DEB.L) slid more than 3 percent to an eight-year low following a weak trading update and a warning on UK sales. Britain's upcoming exit from the European Union, an inconclusive general election, and worrying data on consumer spending have muddied the outlook for bricks-and-mortar retailers like Debenhams, Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) and Next (NXT.L), whose share prices have fallen this year. Short-sellers, who borrow shares in a company before selling them into the market, hoping to buy them back at a lower price in the future and pocket the difference, are doubling down. Of the 10 most-shorted stocks in the UK, five – M&S;, Debenhams, Pets At Home (PETSP.L) and grocers Morrisons (MRW.L) and Ocado (OCDO.L) – are now in the retail sector, according to data from UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority.   This comes after sofa retailer DFS (DFSD.L) warned on June 15 that it would miss expectations on profits this year, blaming an uncertain political and economic outlook, and that the lack of demand was “market-wide”. DFS's comments sent a stock index tracking Britain’s retailers .FTASX5370 down 4.1 percent on June 15 – its biggest one-day fall since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016.  That was followed a day later by Amazon (AMZN.O) announcing its intention to buy Whole Foods (WFM.O), stoking fears the online giant may push further into retail. Analysts and investors are braced for further weakness. “Traditional clothing retailers are an area where I find it much harder to see how the pressure is going to go away,” said Matthew Tillett, a fund manager at Allianz Global Investors. “I am always asking, ‘is it Amazon-able?’ If the answer to that question is ‘yes’ it is always going to be hard for me to buy a bricks and mortar retailer.” UK retail sales fell more sharply than expected in May, data from the Office of National Statistics showed on the same day as the DFS profit warning, with non-food retailers particularly badly affected.  “It is a tough backdrop,” said Tineke Frikkee, a fund manager at Smith & Williamson. It owns shares in M&S; and Debenhams, both of which have seen increases in short interest in the last week. “The response shows you the glass is half empty on these stocks,” Frikkee said. In particular, DFS’s profit warning and Amazon’s expansion have coincided with a spike in short-selling in M&S; and Debenhams.  Of the 11 funds short M&S;’s shares, six increased their positions on June 15 and 16, according to regulatory filings. Short interest in the retailer, which primarily sells clothing and food, has risen more than five-fold to 10.2 percent since the start of the year.   Hedge funds shorting M&S; include Marshall Wace, which has a 2.3 percent position in the company’s shares and is also shorting pet food retailer Pets At Home. At around 130 million pounds ($166 million), the bet against M&S; is one of the fund’s largest shorts in the UK. Marshall Wace declined to comment.  Debenhams, already one of the UK’s most shorted stocks, has seen short interest nearly double since the start of the year to reach an all-time high of 11.9 percent.

The radioactive fuel from more than 100 reactors of over 50 submarines has been stored at Andreyeva Bay in north-western Russia, closed as a naval base in 1992, for the past 35 years. It presented a serious environmental risk, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which helps manage financing for the project, said. From Andreyeva Bay, the spent fuel will be shipped on board a specially-equipped vessel to Russia's Arctic port of Murmansk, then on to its final destination, the Mayak nuclear reprocessing plant in Chelyabinsk, near the Ural Mountains. The project aims to remove all of the 22,000 nuclear fuel assemblies stored at Andreyeva Bay. It is likely to take several years, the EBRD said. The project, established in 2003, supplements Russian, multilateral and bilateral projects and is funded by the European Union and Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom.  It is particularly pleasing to see that nations put aside their differences to resolve such crucial issues as the legacy of the nuclear-powered fleet in the north of Russia,  Pierre Heilbronn, EBRD vice president for policy and partnerships, said in a statement. To date, the fund has received 165 million euros ($186 million) in contributions.

The risks were on full display on Tuesday when shares in Debenhams (DEB.L) slid more than 3 percent to an eight-year low following a weak trading update and a warning on UK sales. Britain's upcoming exit from the European Union, an inconclusive general election, and worrying data on consumer spending have muddied the outlook for bricks-and-mortar retailers like Debenhams, Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) and Next (NXT.L), whose share prices have fallen this year. Short-sellers, who borrow shares in a company before selling them into the market, hoping to buy them back at a lower price in the future and pocket the difference, are doubling down. Of the 10 most-shorted stocks in the UK, five – M&S;, Debenhams, Pets At Home (PETSP.L) and grocers Morrisons (MRW.L) and Ocado (OCDO.L) – are now in the retail sector, according to data from UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority.   This comes after sofa retailer DFS (DFSD.L) warned on June 15 that it would miss expectations on profits this year, blaming an uncertain political and economic outlook, and that the lack of demand was “market-wide”. DFS's comments sent a stock index tracking Britain’s retailers .FTASX5370 down 4.1 percent on June 15 – its biggest one-day fall since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016.  That was followed a day later by Amazon (AMZN.O) announcing its intention to buy Whole Foods (WFM.O), stoking fears the online giant may push further into retail. Analysts and investors are braced for further weakness. “Traditional clothing retailers are an area where I find it much harder to see how the pressure is going to go away,” said Matthew Tillett, a fund manager at Allianz Global Investors. “I am always asking, ‘is it Amazon-able?’ If the answer to that question is ‘yes’ it is always going to be hard for me to buy a bricks and mortar retailer.” UK retail sales fell more sharply than expected in May, data from the Office of National Statistics showed on the same day as the DFS profit warning, with non-food retailers particularly badly affected.  “It is a tough backdrop,” said Tineke Frikkee, a fund manager at Smith & Williamson. It owns shares in M&S; and Debenhams, both of which have seen increases in short interest in the last week. “The response shows you the glass is half empty on these stocks,” Frikkee said. In particular, DFS’s profit warning and Amazon’s expansion have coincided with a spike in short-selling in M&S; and Debenhams.  Of the 11 funds short M&S;’s shares, six increased their positions on June 15 and 16, according to regulatory filings. Short interest in the retailer, which primarily sells clothing and food, has risen more than five-fold to 10.2 percent since the start of the year.   Hedge funds shorting M&S; include Marshall Wace, which has a 2.3 percent position in the company’s shares and is also shorting pet food retailer Pets At Home. At around 130 million pounds ($166 million), the bet against M&S; is one of the fund’s largest shorts in the UK. Marshall Wace declined to comment.  Debenhams, already one of the UK’s most shorted stocks, has seen short interest nearly double since the start of the year to reach an all-time high of 11.9 percent.  Odey Asset Management, run by billionaire investor Crispin Odey, increased its position to nearly 4 percent of the company’s shares on June 15, according to filings. The firm did not respond to requests for comment.    Shorting the sector has been a successful trade so far in 2017: Pets At Home has fallen 33 percent and Debenhams has lost more than a fifth of its value this year. M&S; is down 3 percent.

A third source familiar with the matter agreed that removing more crude from the market was an option but said it was not being actively considered.  It is possible but there are no real discussions now,  this source said, and added that a drawback of the current supply-limiting deal was Nigeria and Libya being exempt.

Market researcher Kantar Worldpanel said UK supermarket industry sales rose 5.0 percent in the 12 weeks to June 18.     The main factor was grocery inflation which rose to 3.2 percent in the period, up from 2.9 percent in last month's data, although a spate of hot weather and weak sales in the same period last year also influenced.     Market leader Tesco recorded its highest sales growth since 2012, with a rise of 3.5 percent, sending its shares up by as much as 2.4 percent.      Tesco has attracted a further 369,000 shoppers and increased sales across all channels, rising fastest online and through its (larger) Extra stores,  said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel.     However, Tesco and its  big four  rivals Sainsbury's , Asda and Morrisons, all continued to lose market share to discounters Aldi             and Lidl           , who recorded sales growth of 18.7 percent and 18.8 percent respectively.     Kantar Worldpanel said the current rate of inflation equated to an extra 133 pounds ($169.5) on the average UK household's annual shopping bill.

The funding was led by Israeli venture capital firm Pitango Growth and also included Qumra Capital, C4 Ventures, Phoenix Insurance Company and Genesis Partners. Capital One participated through its venture arm, Tel Aviv-based Riskified said in a statement. Riskified, whose clients include U.S. retailers Macy's and Foot Locker Inc, said it would use the funds to expand globally and accelerate sales of its software, which helps merchants spot online payment fraud and reduce false alarms that cause genuine buyers to be turned down. In 2016, every dollar of fraud cost merchants $2.40, up from $2.23 a year ago, according to a report from LexisNexis. Fraud as a percentage of revenues grew to 1.47 percent from 1.32 percent over the year.  As more and more consumers move their shopping online, the fraudsters follow,  Riskified co-founder and Chief Executive Eido Gal said in an emailed response to questions by Reuters.  The market for our service is big and getting bigger.  Founded in 2013, Riskified is among a growing number of software developers which help companies analyze vast amounts of data with little manpower. Riskified plans to increase its focus on the U.S. market, where many of its merchants are based, Gal said. It expects to employ 65 people in its New York office by year-end, he added.  Gal described Riskified's investors as strategic partners, but declined to say whether companies owned by Groupe Arnault would be using its technology. LVMH said in May that it would launch an e-commerce site to host all of its brands, as the world's biggest luxury goods group seeks to capitalize on the sector's online sales boom.

Two major surveys showed confidence among British consumers and retailers had fallen back to levels last seen in the wake of the shock 2016 Brexit vote which thrust Britain's $2.5 trillion economy onto an uncertain path. Polling firm YouGov said it expected economic growth to fall sharply over the coming months while the Confederation of British Industry said retailers were downbeat about July. The tension could be felt on the high street, where the second-biggest department store group, Debenhams, warned that trading had turned volatile.  We have seen an increase in customer uncertainty caused by the overall environment and that has an impact on categories that are related to disposable income,  Chief Executive Sergio Bucher said, as clothes sales proved particularly weak. British consumers have been hit by a sharp rise in inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since Britain voted last June to leave the European Union, and by a slowdown in wage growth.  But the real cause for alarm will be the cooling of the property market, as this is one of the key things that has propped up consumer confidence over the past few years,  Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov Reports, said. Britain's housing market has come under pressure in recent months. Mortgage lender Nationwide has reported three successive monthly falls in house prices for the first time since 2009, while rival Halifax says annual growth is the lowest since 2013. The combination of slow growth and high inflation has put the Bank of England in a difficult spot. Its interest-rate setters split 5-3 this month on the need to raise borrowing costs to see off a rise in inflation. The BoE is waiting to see if exports can offset weaker consumer demand. The index of UK consumer confidence produced by YouGov fell back to just above levels last seen in June last year. Its conclusions were based on data collected between June 9, the day after the election, and June 21.  Our preliminary assessment is that economic growth will fall sharply over the coming months and the country will only be saved from recession by strong international trade,  said Douglas McWilliams, deputy chairman at the Centre for Economics and Business Research which produces the index with YouGov. A separate survey by the CBI showed British shops had a better June than economists had expected but retailers are their most downbeat about the month ahead since September last year. Market Volatility Debenhams, a presence on most British high streets, warned profits for its year to August 2017 could be towards the lower end of analysts' forecasts if market volatility did not ease, sending its shares down 4.5 percent. The retailer reported a 0.9 percent fall in group like-for-like sales in the 15 weeks to June 17, its fiscal third quarter. Market leader John Lewis has also reported lacklustre trading in recent weeks.  As industry data has confirmed, May was a tough month for retailers and we continue to see volatility in trading week to week,  Debenham's Bucher said. Official data published earlier this month showed British retail sales fell more sharply than expected in May, while workers' earnings after inflation shrank at the fastest pace since 2014. Sofa retailer DFS Furniture also issued a profit warning this month. Eating into consumers' disposable income, rising inflation has pushed up the price of food, helping British supermarkets to record their highest sales growth in five years. Market researcher Kantar Worldpanel said UK grocery industry sales rose 5.0 percent in the 12 weeks to June 18. Grocery inflation was 3.2 percent, which represented an extra 133 pounds ($170) on the average household's annual shopping bill. It noted butter was almost 20 percent more expensive year-on-year, while there has been a 14 percent price rise across fresh and tinned fish.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsThe 28-year-old American was on a mission from the start of the season as he silenced critics who doubted whether he could thrive without Kevin Durant, who left the Thunder last July and won an NBA title with Golden State two weeks ago. Westbrook carried the Thunder on a nightly basis, setting the new standard by recording 42 triple-doubles, one better than the former single-season mark set by Robertson. Despite the loss of Durant, a four-times scoring champion, the Westbrook-led Thunder recorded 47 wins, just eight fewer than the previous campaign. The first-ever NBA Awards show followed years in which the league announced individual honors separately throughout the postseason. Among the night's other awards, Golden State forward Draymond Green, two weeks removed from winning his second NBA title in three years, was named the best defensive player. Mike D'Antoni was named Coach of the Year after leading Houston to 55 wins in his first season with the team. Milwaukee Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon was named Rookie of the Year, while Houston Rockets guard Eric Gordon earned the Sixth Man Award for his work off the bench as a substitute.

The reprimand of China, Washington's main rival in the Asia-Pacific region, would come despite Trump's budding relationship with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and the U.S. president’s efforts to coax Beijing into helping to rein in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has decided to drop China to  Tier 3,  the lowest grade, putting it alongside Iran, North Korea and Syria among others, said the sources, who have knowledge of the internal deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity. The rating is expected to be announced on Tuesday in an annual report published by the State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. A State Department official declined to comment on the report's contents and said the department  does not discuss details of internal deliberations.  Tier 3 rating can trigger sanctions limiting access to U.S. and international aid, but U.S. presidents frequently waive such action. While it was unclear what led Tillerson to downgrade China, last year's report criticized the communist government for not doing enough to curb  state-sponsored forced labor  and concluded it did not meet  minimum standards  for fighting trafficking – though it still said Beijing was making significant efforts. The Trump administration has also grown concerned about conditions in China for North Korean labor crews that are contracted through Pyongyang and provide hard currency for the North Korean leadership, which is squeezed for cash by international sanctions, said the congressional source. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the government was resolute in its resolve to fight human trafficking and the results were plain to see. FILE PHOTO: A Chinese national flag flutters at Tiananmen Square in Beijing October 20, 2014.Petar Kujundzic China resolutely opposes the U.S. side making thoughtless remarks in accordance with its own domestic law about other countries' work in fighting human trafficking,  he told a daily news briefing. Since taking office, Trump has praised Xi for agreeing to work on the North Korea issue during a Florida summit in April and has held back on attacking Chinese trade practices he railed against during the presidential campaign. But Trump has recently suggested he was running out of patience with China's modest steps to pressure North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States. The annual report, covering more than 180 countries and territories, calls itself the world’s most comprehensive resource of governmental anti-human trafficking efforts.  It organizes countries into tiers based on trafficking and forced labor records: Tier 1 for nations that meet minimum U.S. standards; Tier 2 for those making significant efforts to meet those standards; Tier 2  Watch List  for those that deserve special scrutiny; and Tier 3 for countries that fail to comply with the minimum U.S. standards and are not making significant efforts. For the past three years, China has been ranked  Tier 2 Watch List . In Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump,Lee Gelernt,Mark Goldsmith,USA,IMMIGRATION/IRAQIS (UPDATE 2),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"DETROIT, June 27 (Reuters) - A federal judge halted late on Monday the deportation of all Iraqi nationals detained during immigration sweeps across the United States this month until at least July 10, expanding a stay he imposed last week. The stay had initially only protected 114 detainees from the Detroit area. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith sided with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union who filed an amended complaint on Saturday seeking to prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from deporting Iraqis from anywhere in the United States. The ACLU argued those being deported could face persecution, torture, or death because many were Chaldean Catholics, Sunni Muslims, or Iraqi Kurds and that the groups were recognized as targets of ill-treatment in Iraq. Goldsmith agreed with the ACLU on the grave consequences deportees may face, writing in his seven-page opinion and order that:  Such harm far outweighs any interest the Government may have in proceeding with the removals immediately.  On Thursday, Goldsmith ordered a stay in the Michigan Iraqis' deportation for at least two weeks while he decided whether he had jurisdiction over the merits of deporting immigrants who could face physical danger in their countries of origin. He expanded his stay on Monday to the broader class of Iraqi nationals nationwide, saying it applies to the removal of all Iraqi nationals in the United States with final orders of removal who have been or will be detained by ICE. There are 1,444 Iraqi nationals who have final deportation orders against them, although only 199 of them were detained as part of a nationwide sweep by immigration authorities, federal prosecutors said in court on Monday. Those detained had convictions for serious crimes, including rape and kidnapping, ICE said. Goldsmith also said his stays were designed to give detainees time to find legal representation to appeal against their deportation orders, and to give him time to weigh the question of his jurisdiction. Daniel Lemisch, acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, called the opinion  highly extraordinary.   But it's a very extraordinary circumstance because of the on-the-ground situation in Iraq,  Lemisch said by phone, referring to the danger faced by possible deportees. ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt praised the ruling for saying that  the lives of these individuals should not depend on what part of the United States they reside and whether they could find a lawyer to file a federal court action.  Goldsmith's order came the same day the U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory to President Donald Trump by reviving parts of a travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries. The roundup in Michigan followed Iraq's agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from Trump's revised temporary travel ban. Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago, but they had been allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them. That changed after the two governments came to the agreement in March.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-iraqis-idUSL1N1JO0BM"},

The move would cause a huge problem for the state, which has accumulated a $15 billion bill backlog due to a budget stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. It could force Illinois to stop making full payments on other state-mandated or court-ordered spending such as pensions and payroll. The filing in U.S. District Court by attorneys representing Medicaid recipients asked Judge Joan Lefkow to order the state to pay $500 million a month for four months to start reducing a $3.1 billion pile of unpaid bills owed to managed care organizations that turn pay doctors and others. As long as Illinois remains without an enacted budget, the proposed order calls for the state to spend an additional $586 million a month to cover Medicaid-related bills incurred after June 30, 2017. The proposed order noted that eventual federal Medicaid reimbursements would reduce Illinois' monthly outlay to $543 million. The two sides are scheduled to appear on Wednesday before Lefkow, who previously ruled Illinois' minimal payments to managed care organizations did not comply with federal consent decrees that resulted from two cases filed against the state in 1992. The judge had ordered negotiations aimed at getting Illinois to  substantial  compliance with the decrees, noting the state has managed to make its monthly bond and pension payments on time and in full. Monthly payments related to the Medicaid and other consent decrees have totaled only about $160 million. In the wake of Lefkow's order, Illinois general obligation bond prices plummeted and yields soared in municipal market trading, although the bonds subsequently clawed back some losses. The state comptroller last week pledged to not delay or diminish bond payments. Illinois Attorney General spokeswoman Eileen Boyce said the filing is under review  in light of the state's ongoing severe fiscal crisis.  Rauner ordered lawmakers back into a special session, which began June 21 and is scheduled to end on Friday, to pass a budget before fiscal 2018 begins on Saturday. Entering a third-straight fiscal year without a spending plan could sink Illinois' credit ratings to  junk,  a first for any U.S. state.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-budget-medicaid-idUSL1N1JO0BL"},

Everybody was positioned for a market rebalancing and a stocks draw to happen in the second quarter. And if you look at the macro analysis, that should start happening,  Taylor said in an interview with Reuters.   But so far it hasn't happened and everyone has made the same mistake. Nobody has distinguished themselves.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to cut output by almost 2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January 2017, hoping to bring global oil stocks down from record levels of over 3 billion barrels to a five-year average of around 2.7 billion. But efforts have been somewhat undermined by rising production from Nigeria and Libya, the two OPEC members that have been excluded from cuts after unrest hit their output. Recovering production in the United States has also added to the glut as a bounce in oil prices above $50 per barrel spurred new drilling in shale formations. Taylor said he still expected the market to start rebalancing and stocks to decline in the third quarter. But he was less certain about the fourth quarter, when U.S. shale producers could add more barrels.  We believe the rebalancing and the stocks' draw should still happen in the third quarter. It was simply delayed. The exceptional production factors - Nigeria, Libya and U.S. shale -have been all larger than expected,  Taylor said. Over the past year, militancy hit the oil-producing coastal region in Nigeria, cutting output by nearly 1 million bpd. In Libya, several militant groups blocked major eastern ports and western oilfields in a long-standing stalemate.  But 2017 has witnessed a striking recovery in both. Nigeria is projecting the highest exports since March 2016 with an August loading plan of around 2 million bpd, while Libyan output topped 900,000 bpd this week with 1 million bpd targeted by the end of July. The United States, which is not part of the supply-reduction deal, is expected to increase production from shale by up to 1 million bpd, or almost 10 percent of the country's crude output.  In the third quarter we should draw, but we are unsure about the fourth quarter as U.S. production is likely to have a year-end spurt,  Taylor added. On the demand side, oil consumption growth is still expected to be fairly healthy at 1.3 million bpd in 2017, lending some support to prices, Taylor said. Vitol traded a record amount of crude and refined products in 2016 at over 7 million bpd, a 16 percent rise year-on-year.

Bush,Ilya Shapiro,Ilya Somin,John Roberts,Michele Jawando,Neil Gorsuch,Samuel Alito,USA,COURT/GORSUCH (UPDATE 1,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - In less than three months, President Donald Trump's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch, is already staking out ground on the court's right, adding his voice to the biggest controversies including Trump's travel ban targeted at six Muslim-majority countries, gun control, religious rights and gay rights. In a flurry of activity at the court on Monday, Gorsuch showed his inclination to rule from a spot occupied by fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas. At a minimum, he is so far living up to Trump's claim that he would be a conservative in the mold of the man he replaced, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Thomas, appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1991, is seen by legal experts as the most conservative of the nine justices and is known for his idiosyncratic views of some legal issues. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority. Two of the conservative majority, Anthony Kennedy, and to a lesser extent Chief Justice John Roberts, sometimes side with the liberals. Liberal groups and Democratic senators had vociferously opposed Gorsuch's appointment, with the evidence so far suggesting their depiction of him as a dogged conservative was largely correct.  Justice Gorsuch has shown himself to be the conservative ideologue many predicted he would be and not the moderating check on the executive branch as others suggested he would be,  said Michele Jawando, a lawyer with the liberal Center for American Progress. Conservatives, meanwhile, are delighted. Their hope that Gorsuch, 49, would be a solid vote on the right, would appear to be well founded.  Gorsuch is rapidly becoming my favorite justice,  said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the libertarian Cato Institute. The new justice, formerly an appeals court judge in Colorado, was sworn in on April 10 after Democrats made a concerted effort to block his confirmation by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. Gorsuch has not been shy to make his voice heard since day one on the bench when, during three one-hour arguments, he sparred with attorneys no fewer than eight times.  I'm sorry for taking up so much time, I apologize,  he said, smiling, after one such lengthy exchange. Gorsuch has asserted himself on paper as well. His one opinion for the court, in a case about debt collection, was unanimous. But it's not unusual for new justices to be assigned a first opinion to write where the court is in broad agreement. In the cases where the court has been divided, he has reliably stuck with the conservative wing while showing something of an independent streak similar to Thomas. Gorusch nailed his colors to the mast in a series of written opinions and votes on Monday. In the biggest dispute before the justices, the court handed a partial win to Trump by partly reviving his travel ban that he has said is needed for security reasons but opponents criticize as discriminatory. The ban was blocked by lower courts and the high court agreed to hear oral arguments in its next term starting in October. Gorsuch, with two of the court's other conservatives, said they would have voted to allow the entire ban to go into effect. When the court also declined to hear what would have been a major gun rights case on whether the constitutional right to keep firearms for self-defense extends outside the home, only two of the nine justices dissented. One was Thomas. The other was Gorsuch. A gay rights case saw a similar pattern, with Thomas, Gorsuch and fellow conservative Samuel Alito the only dissenters as the court threw out an Arkansas court ruling that allowed the state to refuse to list both same-sex spouses on birth certificates. Gorsuch has also showed a willingness to quibble with his colleagues on what might seem minor points. In the court's big ruling on Monday in a religious rights case, the justices were split 7-2 on allowing a church to apply for state funding to re-pave its school playground. Gorsuch wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Thomas, in which he explained in part why he agreed with all of the majority opinion, except for one footnote that limited it.  It could be that he is more similar to Thomas than Scalia. If he continues this pattern it might be significant,  said Ilya Somin, a libertarian law professor at George Mason University.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-gorsuch-idUSL1N1JN1X3"},

Soaring property prices have pushed up rents and had a knock-on effect as businesses raise prices on goods and services, forcing people like Lau to find extra work.  You have to work yourself to death. If you don't work and work, you can't cover living costs,  Lau said at her food stall in a city wet market.  The situation in Hong Kong is terrible,  she said. Income inequality has reached its highest level in more than four decades, according to government data, as a red-hot property market squeezes the city's most vulnerable people and risks fuelling social tensions.    The city of 7.3 million people has the world's third largest concentration of individuals worth more than $30 million, behind London and number one New York, according to a global wealth report by real estate consultancy Knight Frank.   Hong Kong had 4,080 ultra high-net worth individuals in 2016, the report said, but mainland China has more than three times that number and many of them have bought property in the territory. Despite government efforts to alleviate poverty, the city remains among the most inequitable in the world, said charity Oxfam, citing recent census data. The wealthiest 10 percent of households earn nearly 44 times more than the poorest 10 percent who make an average of HK$2,560 ($328.20) per month, according to a 2016 household income report published by the Census and Statistics Dept this month. Hong Kong's Gini coefficient for household income - a widely used measure of income disparity - rose to 0.539 last year on a scale from zero to one, the highest rating recorded in over four decades. Zero represents equality. Singapore, another Asian financial hub, saw its coefficient fall to 0.458 in 2016, the lowest in a decade. The United States recorded a figure of 0.394 in 2014, while the United Kingdom came in at 0.358 in 2013, according to the OECD.

Picture taken June 8, 2017.Bobby YipHousing Discontent Hong Kong's property market, one of the world's most expensive, is a stark example of the widening wealth gap. An apartment of less than 200 square feet can cost as much as $500,000 in Hong Kong, where home prices have surged more than 137 percent since the financial crisis in 2008, propelled by a supply shortage, low interest rates, and big flows of money from the mainland.

Many poor and elderly can only afford to live in small cubicles or subdivided flats, said Kalina Tsang, senior manager for Ofxam in Hong Kong.  One of the most urgent things for the new government to do is increase the public rental protection housing in Hong Kong so that poor people can have a decent living,  Tsang said. Hong Kong-leader elect Carrie Lam, who takes over on July 1, has said she is  very determined  to tackle the high cost of housing, which helped fuel pro-democracy protests in 2014. Hong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, the city's former commissioner for poverty, said the government has a plan to free up land for public and private housing over the next 10 years.  Property prices have always been a problem and still remain a problem that we need to tackle,  he said. The government is trying  but it's never enough , said 23-year-old Joyce Leung, who works for a recruiting firm and lives with her family because she can't afford to rent.  I feel they are helping more the investors or the wealthy individuals than the general public.

A €5.3bn takeover bid by private equity groups Bain and Cinven did not win enough shareholder support after just 65.52% of Stada's equity capital signed up for the deal, falling short of the 67.5% acceptance threshold. The financing backing the buyout from Barclays, Citigroup, Commerzbank, Jefferies, JP Morgan, Nomura, Societe Generale and UBS had been conditional on the deal going ahead. Banks are estimated to lose out on around €60m of fees altogether -- around €7.5m each -- based on a 2% underwriting fee. It is the latest blow for lenders, which this year have been working for small fees on a relentless round of repricings and refinancings. “It was a significant fee event that is no longer happening so it will impact the underwriting banks,” a leveraged finance head said. LARGEST FINANCING Investors will also be disappointed as it was set to be the largest leveraged financing so far this year, offering a chance to put a hefty amount of new money to work to soak up excess liquidity and reverse the supply/demand imbalance that has plagued the market. “Stada was the escape valve, a significant transaction to allow a large deployment of capital to take some of the pressure off. Although there is some supply coming to the market, there is nowhere near enough to satisfy demand so it will embolden underwriters and arrangers and worry investors who are already feeling they have too few places to put cash,  the leveraged finance head said. The underwritten financing included a €1.95bn seven-year senior secure term loan B; €485m of seven-year senior secured fixed rate bonds; €340m of eight-year senior unsecured fixed rate notes; and a €400m seven-year revolving credit facility. The prospect of such a large financing had caused loan investors to push back on some of the more aggressive deals in syndication to get better terms. The more liquid names in Europe’s secondary loan market had also begun to soften in the last couple of weeks for the first time since March, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data, as investors sold out to make room for the new supply. Now the withdrawal of Stada from the market is expected to see investors return to accepting increasingly aggressive terms and tight pricing. “Although we began to see some pushback, the concern has to be that investors will now sacrifice credit discipline for the expediency of putting cash to work. Stada’s loss will inflate the bubble again,” the leveraged finance head said. A second leveraged finance head said: “Pricing will continue to be compressed. Without Stada, we can expect to see most deals go successfully. It’s back to being a borrowers' market.” Bain and Cinven are in talks over a potential new Stada offer and are speaking with investors -- mainly with hedge funds -- about the terms. The expectation is that Bain and Cinven will look to revive the financing they had in place, if the new offer goes ahead, gifting a second chance to the underwriting banks and investors.

Immigration Late last night, a federal judge halted the deportation of all Iraqi nationals detained during immigration sweeps across the United States this month until at least July 10, expanding a stay he imposed last week. The stay had initially only protected 114 detainees from the Detroit area. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith sided with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union who argued those being deported could face persecution, torture, or death because many were Chaldean Catholics, Sunni Muslims, or Iraqi Kurds and that the groups were recognized as targets of ill-treatment in Iraq.   Syria The White House warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that he and his military would  pay a heavy price  if it conducted a chemical weapons attack and said the United States had reason to believe such preparations were underway.

SAA, which is reliant on government debt guarantees of almost 20 billion rand, has been cited as a threat to South Africa's economy by rating agencies that have recently downgraded the country's sovereign rating to  junk . If SAA fails to meet its debt obligations, it may have ripple effects on the government's wider guarantee framework, Treasury Director General Dondo Mogajane told legislators.  So we understand the urgency and importance of acting carefully and in a very responsible way, so we are seized with the matter,  Mogajane said in response to questions during a presentation by state-owned SAA to parliament. SAA's chief financial officer, Phumeza Nhantsi, told journalists that around 9 billion rand of debt was maturing in a few days time, with around 6 or 7 lenders involved. She did not name any of the lenders due to confidentiality clauses, but confirmed that they were looking to the Public Investment Corporation, Africa's largest pension fund, as a possible lender in future. According to the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), Standard Chartered Bank has declined to renew its loan facilities of 2.3 billion rand to SAA due on June 30.

They include the larger joint-stock banks China Merchants Bank (600036.SS)(3968.HK) and China Minsheng Banking Corp (600016.SS)(1988.HK). Li, previously a senior official at China' banking regulator, said the bank was looking for foreign investors for the listing. Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd (STAN.L) is currently its second-biggest shareholder, with a 19.99 percent stake. The maximum equity stake in a Chinese bank that foreign institutions may own is currently capped at 20 percent for a single foreign investor and 25 percent for all foreign investors.  Bohai Bank is going public and we will further open up to global investors,  Li said at the Forum. He did not specify where the bank intended to list its shares. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said at the Forum on Tuesday that Beijing would give foreign investors greater market access to services and industrial sectors as well as treat foreign and domestic firms equally.  I hope what Premier Li Keqiang said this morning about relaxing restrictions on investment percentages held by foreign firms will further open-up Bohai Bank during its listing process,  Li said. The IPO could take place in the first half of 2018 and the bank is currently boosting capital internally, some domestic media outlets reported, citing Li speaking on the sidelines of the Forum. Bohai Bank, headquartered in Tianjin, was the first Chinese-funded commercial bank to introduce overseas strategic investors at the establishment stage, according to its website. Besides Standard Chartered, other Bohai Bank shareholders include TEDA Investment Holding Co, China Shipping Investment Co, State Development & Investment Corporation and China Baowu Steel Group.

The following is a summary of the EU decision and Google's other regulatory issues. Record Fine The fine represents 3 percent of Alphabet/Google's turnover in 2016. The biggest sanction prior to that was U.S. chipmaker Intel's (INTC.O) 1.06 billion euro fine in 2009. What the Commission Wants Google to Do The Commission found that Google had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results.  The Commission wants the company to stop that, or face additional non-compliance payments of five percent of Alphabet's average daily global turnover. Who Are the Complainants The action came after a seven-year long investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals such as U.S. consumer review website Yelp (YELP.N), TripAdvisor (TRIP.O), UK price comparison site Foundem, News Corp (NWSA.O) and lobbying group FairSearch. What Next for Google Google may choose to appeal in EU courts, but Intel, the previous antitrust fine record holder, has waited seven years for a final judgment on its appeal. Google remains under Commission investigation in two other cases. These concern its Android mobile operating system, where the company is charged with  requiring and incentivising  manufacturers to prioritize its apps and web services, and Google's  AdSense for Search  platform, allegedly used to restrict search ads from rivals. Other Regulatory Issues for Google Google and other US-based internet companies face increasing scrutiny and regulation from the EU regarding user privacy and data storage, most recently on messaging, email and voice services. The EU largely expects greater cooperation from tech companies on cyber security and counter-terrorism. Last week's European Council Summit called for the industry to step up efforts to remove extremist content and disrupt communication support for terrorist acts.  On Monday, Facebook , Google's YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft responded with the announcement of a Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. Other Tech Companies Under Investigation The Commission has a number of ongoing cases involving technology giants, notably Qualcomm which was accused in 2015 of using financial incentives and predatory pricing to force out competition. In early June, the Commission opened an additional investigation into Qualcomm's $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors.

Five months into Trump's presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama's eight years in the White House.  But the falls were far steeper in some of America's closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.  Trump took office in January pledging to put  America First . Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.  On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.  Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.  In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.   The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,  the Pew report said.  The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa .

Slideshow (3 Images)  Infographic ID: '2rVZ1DK'     Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.  The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.  Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as  arrogant , 65 percent as  intolerant  and 62 percent as  dangerous . A majority of 55 percent also described him as a  strong leader .  The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump's signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.  On the positive side, the survey showed that 58 percent of respondents had a positive view of Americans in general. And in many regions of the world, a majority or plurality of respondents said they expected relations with the United States to stay roughly the same in spite of Trump.

Full-year group profit dropped 7 percent, with headline earnings per share (EPS), the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out certain one-off items, down to 8.81 rand ($0.68) for the year ended March 31. The results sent Omnia's shares tumbling nearly 9 percent on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to 132 rand by 1103 GMT. Omnia, which has divisions in agriculture, mining and chemicals, has suffered a slump in chemicals sales volumes as South Africa's economy slid into recession for the first time since 2009 and its manufacturing and mining sectors contracted. That has prompted it to look for new growth areas to boost its chemicals division. The company said it will look at markets outside South Africa and further acquisitions to strengthen its chemicals business, which has a distribution market throughout South Africa, southern and East Africa.  We primarily are interested in African markets and it's an area we have basically under-penetrated from a chemicals perspective,  said Rod Humphris, who stepped down from being Group managing director to chairman at the start of June. Omnia, which has already acquired a 90 percent stake in South Africa's unlisted Umongo Petroleum for 780 million rand as part of its strategy to expand its chemical business, will continue to look for further acquisitions in its chemicals business, he told Reuters.  We are certainly looking for more acquisitions. We have not yet exhausted the capacity of our balance sheet.   We are looking at anything that will strengthen our existing business as for example Umongo does for our chemicals business,  he said. Omnia had 90 million rand of net cash at year-end and no debt. Humphris said the company could look at  perhaps even adding a fourth leg to our business.  But he said any new activity would have to be in the chemicals sector  whether that be chemical products or chemical services because that is the golden thread that runs right through our business.  Revenue in Omnia's chemical business fell 7 percent to 3.7 billion rand as volumes sold fell by 8 percent due to the subdued manufacturing sector and drought affecting the animal feeds sector, the company said in a statement. The mining unit saw revenue fall 4 percent to 4.4 billion rand while revenue in the agriculture division remained relatively flat at 8.2 billion rand.

China has stepped up security in Xinjiang in its far west amid fears of attacks by militants from the mostly Muslim Uighur ethnic minority. A car bomber attacked the Chinese embassy in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek last year. Helicopters, armored jeeps and 700 border police officers from the neighbors took part in the exercise in Xinjiang's Kirgiz Prefecture, China's official Xinhua news agency reported. The drills were observed by officials from all countries in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security bloc jointly led by China and Russia, that includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan, it said. Chinese officer Chen Dingwu, who was in charge of he exercise, told Xinhua the troops were simulating weapons smuggling by militants from Kyrgyzstan into China. Video footage broadcast by China's state media showed a police van cutting off a mini-bus and then speedily reversing away through simulated explosions as an attacker struck the van's windshield with a baton.     Other footage showed helicopters firing what appeared to be live missiles at a mountaintop target, jeeps mounted with machineguns subjected to simulated ambushes, and officers practicing riot control with police dogs. Beijing says security in Xinjiang is under threat from militant separatists, in particular from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which China says stirs up tension between members of the Uighur community and ethnic majority Han people. Rights groups say that much of the unrest and violence in the region is a result of Chinese government policies that restrict the cultural and religious freedoms of Uighurs. China denies treating anyone unfairly. Kyrgyzstan's state security said the August 2016 attack on China's embassy, in which the car-bomber and was killed and three people were wounded, was ordered by Uighur militants in Syria and carried out by a member of ETIM. Xinjiang is an important section of China's Belt and Road initiative, President Xi Jinping's plan to expand trade and energy networks along the old Silk Road to the Middle East and Europe beyond. Xinjiang shares a 5,700 km (3,540 mile) border with eight separate countries and has 15 dry ports.

Front-month Brent futures prices are up by about $2 a barrel since touching a low of $44 on June 21, which could herald a break in the downtrend that had been in place since late May. Rising prices most likely reflect hedge funds covering some short positions rather than a fundamental reappraisal of the outlook for supply, demand and inventories. Hedge fund managers have become progressively more bearish about petroleum prices in recent weeks (tmsnrt.rs/2ti1hd0). By June 20 hedge funds had amassed 480 million barrels of short positions in the five main futures and options contracts linked to crude, gasoline and heating oil, up from only 350 million barrels on June 6. Fund managers have only held a larger number of short positions in petroleum once before, in January 2016, when their combined shorts in the five contracts totaled 484 million barrels. The position in January 2016 coincided with the trough of the oil price cycle and marked the start of the recovery. The question is whether the large number of shorts now will mark a similar turning point. Hedge Fund Ratio In crude, hedge fund long positions still outnumbered short positions by a ratio of 2.1 to 1 on June 20, but this was one of the lowest ratios recorded in recent years (tmsnrt.rs/2shAw3n and tmsnrt.rs/2shpefo). The ratio of long to short positions has often been correlated with the rise and fall in oil prices (tmsnrt.rs/2sMlpCw and tmsnrt.rs/2sM5RyI). The attempt to accumulate a large number of long positions tends to push prices higher, while efforts to accumulate short positions has the opposite effect. But once the positions have been established, the existence of large concentrations of long or short positions and a stretched ratio have often signaled the price trend is about to reverse. With so many shorts now in crude, gasoline and heating oil, the risk of a short-covering rally when fund managers attempt to lock in some of their profits has increased significantly. And with relatively few long positions left to close, the downside threat from further liquidation has been reduced. From a pure positioning perspective, the balance of risks in the oil market has therefore shifted to the upside, with the probability of a short-covering rally now much greater than further liquidation-driven price falls. The fundamental outlook remains uncertain, meanwhile, with an unsustainable increase in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States and doubts about whether global inventories will fall to their five-year average in 2018 and stay there. If the U.S. rig count continues rising beyond the end of July, oil prices may need to fall further to bring the drilling boom back under control. In the meantime, however, the huge number of short positions in the market could help to put a short-term floor under prices and potentially trigger a rally.

Partner's revenue and profit have plunged in the wake of a 2012 reform that opened up the mobile market to a host of new players and its new TV service follows a similar move by rival Cellcom two years ago. Partner TV will be available from July and will cost 69 shekels ($20) a month, or 89 shekels with a subscription to Netflix. It will offer cut-rate packages bundling TV with home phones and internet and may include mobiles later. Israel's television market is dominated by cable company HOT and satellite TV firm YES, whose extensive offerings can cost over 300 shekels a month, and analysts say Partner will need to grab up to six percent of the TV market to break even. While the price is low enough to lure many Israelis to Partner's new service, critics believe the absence of an HBO channel, which rivals have, could keep those who enjoy  Game of Thrones  and other HBO shows away. Based on the Android TV operating system, Partner TV will offer 40 Israeli and international channels and a wide range of on-demand TV shows and movies. Viewing will be available on tablets and mobile phones, in addition to a set-top box.  The market is changing,  Partner Chief Executive Isaac Benbenisti.  We see how people consume content - it's different. We see the massive movement from traditional TV to the open world.   People are looking for open devices to watch Netflix and YouTube,  he told Reuters after a news conference.  We are combining the traditional TV, the traditional way people consume content, with the open world.  He said that while content was expensive, Partner would be able to keep costs low by using the open Android system and that full-service telecoms firms had to offer packages bundling multiple products together.  In the United States we are we seeing similar narrow bundles and skinny bundle services and we think Israeli is going to adopt it very quickly,  Partner Chairman Adam Chesnoff said. Cellcom launched an internet-based TV service of channels and on-demand shows and movies for 99 shekels a month two years ago and it now about 125,000 subscribers. Barclays analyst Tavy Rosner said Partner's subscribers would probably come from YES, which has been losing customers.  Partner will likely need to reach about five to six percent market share to break even on the TV side,  he said.

Trump,Eric Garcetti,Michael Bloomberg,Philip Levine,Todd Myers,US,USA,CLIMATE,CHANGE,CITIES,Americas,Climate Politics,Science,Environment,Florida,United States,New York City,Disasters / Accidents,Floods","sector":"","content":"MIAMI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - U.S. cities will lead the fight against climate change by working harder to reduce emissions, switch to cleaner energy and protect residents from sea-level rise even as Washington refuses to formally acknowledge global warming as a problem, mayors said this week. As the U.S. Conference of Mayors wrapped up on Monday in Miami Beach, a city that's at the forefront of the fight against rising waters, the message was clear: cities aim to ensure the U.S. remains a leading global player in climate policies and innovation, and mayors will sidestep Washington to achieve their goals.  More than 250 mayors at the event signed nonbinding resolutions including a cities-driven plan to slow climate change – though no emissions targets were set – and a target to power their communities with 100 percent renewable energy by 2035.  The growing Climate Mayors movement also saw new mayors signing a letter agreeing to abide by the Paris accord and step up efforts to reach city climate targets. The letter now has 330 mayoral signatures.  We are creating a groundswell of climate leadership by the mayors because cities large and small, rural and urban, in blue and red states, experience the effects of climate change every single day,  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said.  Climate change touches us all and unites us.  U.S. cities are scrambling to fill a leadership void and assert their role as a leading force against global warming after President Donald Trump decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord earlier this month, raising the risk of potential changes to carbon emissions regulations and energy policy.  Under the Paris deal, former President Barack Obama's administration vowed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. In the only pledge that was backed by financing, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg committed $200 million to support city initiatives including projects to combat global warming through a grant program called the American Cities Initiative.   We are expanding our support to empower mayors so they can meet the challenges of climate change and support what was laid out in Paris, no matter what happens in Washington,  Bloomberg told a cheering crowd on Monday.   On nearly all issues, Washington has been AWOL, and as further cuts loom, the situation will go from bad to worse,  he said. After Trump's decision, Bloomberg offered $15 million to support the United Nations' efforts to tackle climate change and has been the loudest voice in the campaign to empower cities, businesses and citizens to take charge to combat global warming. He took advantage of the rock star treatment he received at the mayors' conference to promote his new book  Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses and Citizens can Save the Planet .   A strong message of bipartisanship set the tone of the speeches and committee meetings, and humor was often used in reference to Trump's dismissal of the increasingly clear effects of climate change.   Politics has almost no influence on science, in case you haven't noticed,  former President Bill Clinton told a packed ballroom at Miami Beach's iconic Fontainebleau Hotel on Saturday.   Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine said Trump should be concerned about sea level rise in front of his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.  I'm not really sure if he wants to turn that into a water park,  Levine said. As the host of the annual conference, Levine showed off his anti-flooding efforts by taking New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and others on a tour of Sunset Harbor, considered Miami's ground zero for the fight against climate change. There streets have been raised and pumps installed to keep water away from luxury condos and upscale restaurants.  Accompanied by his chief engineer Bruce Mowry, whom the mayor calls  Pump Man , Levine bragged about how the thriving economy allowed the city to raise more than $400 million for anti-flooding projects through tax increases. Though cities appear are showing newfound urgency to tackle climate change after Trump's decision, it remains to be seen if the pledges made in Miami will translate into action.  Skeptics were quick to point out that in 2007 more than a thousand U.S. mayors signed a pledge to meet the emissions cuts mandated under the Kyoto Protocol, but virtually all of them missed the targets.  Large U.S. cities such as New York and Chicago are currently on track to miss current targets, Washington Policy Center director Todd Myers wrote in a June 15 column for the National Review.    The failure of these cities to achieve existing goals is a stark demonstration of the gap between environmental rhetoric and results from those who style themselves as environmental heroes,  he wrote.

The CSOP FTSE China A50 ETF, which invests in China shares under the so-called RQFII scheme, attracted inflows of roughly 1.5 billion yuan ($220.16 million) on Tuesday from long-only capital and some hot money, fund manager CSOP Asset Management said in a statement. The RQFII, or RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors scheme, helps channel offshore yuan into China's stocks and bonds.  Investors are seeking investment instruments with very good liquidity to play on the inclusion,  CSOP Asset Management Co said, noting also that the FTSE China A 50 Index is highly correlated to MSCI's A-share inclusion plan. MSCI said last week that under the plan, it will start including 222 China big-caps into the MSCI Emerging Market Index starting June next year. Of the 222 stocks, the top 30 by market capitalization are covered by its RQFII ETF, CSOP Asset Management said. Global asset manager Vanguard Group also expressed its optimism toward China assets following the MSCI inclusion. In June, 2015, Vanguard decided to add China A-shares to its broad emerging markets ETF, and over the past two years, the asset manager has invested over 25 billion yuan into China, with stakes in over 1900 mainland-listed companies, according to Charles Lin, head of Greater China at Vanguard Investments Hong Kong.

Britain's vote to leave the EU plunged the bloc into an existential crisis a year ago and unleashed a wave of euroscepticism. But election victories for Emmanuel Macron in France and the pro-EU incumbent in the Netherlands have since given the union new hope.  I am certainly more optimistic today than I was last year or two years ago,  Frans Timmermans, deputy head of the EU's executive European Commission, told Reuters in an interview.  Over the last years, rightly or wrongly, the impression was created that Germany is too dominant. So the fact that France now steps in a more assertive way is good for Europe as a whole, is good for France, and especially good for Germany.   During EU leaders' talks in Brussels last week, Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear they want to work hand-in-hand on the future of the remaining 27 nations.  The Dutchman said the details still depended on the German national election in September.  I understand full well that there will be an impetus driven by France and Germany to European cooperation in the latter part of this year. I also understand that other member states are waking up to that and are also getting organized.   That there will be more integration is a foregone conclusion. But in what areas? Let's wait and see.  The 56-year-old listed developing a digital single market for the EU's 500 million citizens, improving diversity and sustainability of energy supplies, and ensuring fairer trade rules among projects to come. He was cautious on reforming the single-currency zone, which brings together 19 EU states, after the careful Merkel showed openness to Macron's ideas for euro budget and finance minister. Timmermans said Russia's resurgence has also played a role in galvanizing Europe, as did U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from a global deal on fighting climate change, and his vague stance on European security guarantees under NATO. Timmermans spoke on Monday afternoon, just before British Prime Minister Theresa May presented her offer for safeguarding expat rights after Brexit. While he did not comment on the latest, he said the EU27 was waiting for London.[nL8N1JN1G4]   We didn't ask them to leave. They asked to leave ... The onus is on them now, not on us. We are ready. I want to wait for them to clarify their position and we'll take it from there.   There is going to be harm, on both sides. But let's try do as little harm as possible,  he said.  European Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans speaks during an interview with Reuters at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 26, 2017.Francois Lenoir Let's try and make this a cooperative process, not a confrontational process - and the last thing we want is for it to be a punitive process, because it is not.  East-West Wedge The unity of the remaining 27 EU states is widely seen as crucial for the unprecedented Brexit talks. But divisive feuds over migration, the rule of law and EU funds have driven a wedge between the wealthier, western EU states espousing more open world views and their formerly communist peers in the east.  Timmermans is leading a unique rule of law case against the nationalist-minded government in Poland, which put the judiciary and state media under more direct control. The bloc has also long expressed concern about undermining democracy in Hungary. European Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans speaks during an interview with Reuters at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 26, 2017.Francois Lenoir My preferred method is dialogue. And that, with all the frictions we have, is still something we have with the Hungarians, we do not have with this Polish government.  He said he would bring the case back to all 28 EU states for a discussion later this year should Warsaw not resume talks. Quipping on criticism from Warsaw, which sees him as lacking authority to interfere, Timmermans said his son sometimes jokingly greets him as the  unelected, faceless bureaucrat , too.  I am not that pessimistic because there is so much support for the EU in all these countries,  he said.  A late 2016 Eurobarometer poll showed Luxembourg, Ireland and the Netherlands with the highest backing for the EU, while Greece, the Czech Republic and Italy sat at the other end. Support for the EU in Poland was closer to the higher readings at 61 percent, and for Hungary it stood at 47 percent, closer to the lower end. Timmermans said more cooperation on security, tighter control of the bloc's external border and sustaining the revived economic growth would help overcome distrust between EU states that grew over a decade of crises - from banking to migration. While he hoped the new Franco-German cooperation would create a momentum for the whole of EU, the eastern EU states are wary of decisions being taken above their heads.   We have to overcome that,  Timmermans said of the east-west divides, pointing to mingling young Europeans as a source of hope.  You go to my country, you go to Poland, you go to Greece, you go to Scandinavian countries, you go to Spain - everybody under the age of 30 speaks the same bad English, which is very helpful.

In the study, patients receiving the 300 mg dosage experienced a reduction of 4.3 days from baseline in monthly migraine days, while those on the 100 mg saw a reduction of 3.9 days.

By comparison, Philadelphia has lost 16 of 19 overall and sports the worst record in the majors (24-51), managing only 80 runs in June. The Phillies fell to 7-17 this month and lost for the 10th time in last 11 road outings following Monday's 6-1 defeat in Arizona - the 14th time they have scored no more than one run.

That looked like the old Nola, and that was great to see. That's the Nola we have come to love. He was outstanding, hitting paint on both sides,  manager Pete Mackanin told reporters. The 24-year-old Louisiana native will attempt to improve his 1-4 record and 7.71 ERA in six interleague starts as he faces Seattle for the first time. Paxton fanned eight but otherwise labored through a no-decision Wednesday against Detroit, allowing four runs (three earned) on nine hits and two walks while throwing 101 pitches over 5 1/3 innings. The 28-year-old Canadian is 0-2 with a 9.69 ERA in his last three starts after going 5-0, 1.69 over his first eight turns of the season. Howie Kendrick is 5-for-14 against Paxton, who was tagged for four runs (one earned) across four innings in his only start against the Phillies in 2014. Walk-Offs 1.

The Brewers will look to pick up where they left off against the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday when the National League Central rivals open a three-game series at Great American Ball Park. Milwaukee won six of seven versus Cincinnati in April due in large part to the red-hot bat of Eric Thames, who hit a blistering .440 with eight homers and 13 RBIs. The 30-year-old has cooled considerably over the last two months with a 3-for-29 effort over his last eight games telling the tale of his struggles in June - during which he is batting .179.

The 32-year-old saw his pitch count elevate to a season-high 114 as a result of surrendering a campaign-high five walks, marking the sixth straight time he's issued at least three or more free passes this season. Guerra owns a 1-0 mark with a 3.00 ERA in two career starts versus Cincinnati. Like Guerra, Adleman has struggled with issuing free passes after surrendered four walks in each of his last two contests. The 29-year-old was saddled with the loss in both outings despite yielding two runs in six innings versus the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 16 and permitting three in five frames five days later in an 8-3 setback at Tampa Bay. Adleman pitched well in relief against Milwaukee earlier this season, but yielded a homer to Thames in four innings in a 4-2 setback on April 16. Walk-Offs 1.

The Angels extended their winning streak to three games with a 4-0 victory on Monday, moving within one game of Minnesota for the second wild card while ending three significant Dodger streaks in the process. The Dodgers rode a 10-game winning streak - 11 at Dodger Stadium, where they are a major league-best 32-11 - into Monday's contest and had homered in 17 straight contests to match the Los Angeles club record set in 1960.

In March, the San Francisco-based firm, which allows people to book journeys on their smartphone, lost a court battle against Transport for London (TfL), the latest setback as the authorities crack down on the ride service. Uber has cited TfL data that the language rules, which would involve written tests, could mean about 33,000 private hire drivers out of a total of around 110,000 operating in London would be unable to renew their licences. Drivers applying for a new or renewed licence have until the end of September to prove they meet the more rigorous English language criteria, pushed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan partly in response to pressure from drivers of the city's traditional black cabs who fear their business model is being undercut. Uber called for the proposals to be delayed until after court proceedings due next February at the very least.  We're pleased to have secured this appeal to defend tens of thousands of drivers who risk losing their livelihoods because they can't pass an essay writing test,  Uber's London General Manager Tom Elvidge said on Tuesday.  We urge TfL and the Mayor not to introduce these disproportionate and discriminatory rules before the appeal is heard,  he said. TfL did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday. Uber has had a tumultuous few months after a string of scandals involving allegations of sexism and bullying at the firm, leading to investor pressure which forced out chief executive and co-founder Travis Kalanick.

On the deck of Thunder Horse, they work two-week shifts, drink seawater from a desalination plant, and eat ribs and chicken ferried in by boat. On the ocean floor, robots provide remote eyes and arms as drills extract up to 265,000 barrels per day.  There's a whole city below us,  said Jim Pearl, Marine Team Leader on the platform. This is just one of the four Gulf of Mexico platforms on which BP has staked its future in U.S. oil production. Seven years after its Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, BP is betting tens of billions of dollars on the prospect that it can slash the costs of offshore drilling by half or more - just as shale oil producers have done onshore. The firm says it can do that while it continues to pay an estimated $61 billion in total costs and damages from the worst spill in history - and without compromising safety. BP's Gulf platforms are key to a global strategy calling for up to $17 billion in annual investments through 2021 to increase production by about 5 percent each year, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley recently told investors.  Our strategy is to take this investment that we spent so much money building, and keep it full  to the platform's capacity, Richard Morrison, BP's regional president for the Gulf of Mexico, told Reuters during the first tour of a BP Gulf drilling platform since the disaster.  We're also exploring for larger pools of oil.  BP's deepwater double-down is all the more striking for the contrast to its chief competitors, who have cooled on offshore investments in light of the lower costs and quicker returns of onshore shale plays. While BP has some onshore U.S. developments, the firm is notably absent from the industry's rush into shale oil fields of the West Texas Permian Basin. Majors including Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell have maintained Gulf operations but focused expansions on U.S. shale. Exxon Mobil doubled its acreage in the Permian in a deal earlier this year. Freeport-McMoRan and Devon Energy Corp have pulled out of Gulf drilling entirely in recent years. Anadarko Petroleum Corp took a $435-million dollar write-down in May on its Shenandoah project in the Gulf, deciding it could not profit with oil prices hovering at about $50 a barrel.  In a $50 to $60 world, we always felt like greenfield development, in the Gulf in particular, was fairly challenged,  Anadarko CEO Al Walker told investors last month. Oil prices dropped steeply last week, settling in the low $40s per barrel. BP says its next Gulf development - the $9 billion Mad Dog phase two - would be profitable even at $40 a barrel. As recently as 2013, BP reported that it could not start new deepwater Gulf projects at prices lower than $100 a barrel. A Billion Barrels In time, BP's offshore expansion could produce a huge payoff. The firm announced last month that it had discovered an additional billion barrels of oil below its four audaciously named Gulf platforms - Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Na Kika and Mad Dog. The find - worth more than $40 billion at today's market prices - amounts to more than three times the proven reserves at the Na Kika field, or the equivalent of three new fields in the Gulf.  It seems like every ten years there's another breakthrough  that unlocks more Gulf oil, Morrison said on the deck of Thunder Horse. Over his shoulder, a drillship three miles away tapped a new well that will feed production into the massive platform. In the wake of the 2010 BP disaster, deepwater production was curtailed by a six-month U.S. government moratorium on drilling and a longer period of uncertainty about regulation. But output has rebounded to new record highs as projects sanctioned years ago start operations and existing hubs such as Thunder Horse expand. BP's big new discovery is key to its slashing of estimated per-barrel costs, as are a host of drilling innovations and more favorable deals with service providers. For eight decades, geologists have used seismic imaging to estimate oil and gas reserves beneath the rocky undersea terrain. BP used its own new technology for the billion-barrel discovery. Called full waveform inversion, the technique uses massive amounts of data to create a high-resolution model of reserves that were previously hidden beneath salt deposits. The firm also aims to tap those reserves without building new multi-billion-dollar platforms. At Thunder Horse and other platforms, BP is installing wellheads on the seabed and connecting them to pipelines that rise up to existing platforms, like the legs of a spider. These  tiebacks  allow producers to feed oil from remote regions of fields that previously went untapped. Other design changes helped BP hold down the investment in Mad Dog's second phase from an initially estimated $20 billion to just $9 billion, the company said. Such savings are part of the equation BP uses to estimate the platform's profitability at oil prices of $40 a barrel. The struggles of deepwater oil service firms - who were forced to cut prices after per-barrel prices tanked in 2014 - are also keeping BP's expansion costs low.  If you're going to be building an offshore Gulf of Mexico platform, now is the time to be doing it,  said Norm MacDonald, portfolio manager for Invesco's energy fund, which has increased its stake in BP, its second-largest holding. Other funds remain leery of offshore investments because of the longer wait for a return in a volatile industry. Shale has a  liquidity premium  because producers can make smaller investments and recoup them sooner, within two or three years, said Michael Roomberg, a portfolio analyst at Miller-Howard Investments. Tie-backs and other advances, however, could accelerate deepwater returns and help narrow the liquidity gap with shale, MacDonald said. Cost Cutting, Safety Concerns BP's growing deepwater investments irk some environmentalists, who say the company has fought paying what it owes to restore shorelines and communities damaged by its massive spill. They also see the threat of another disaster.  They never really fulfilled those promises, and people are very skeptical about them expanding drilling,  said Raleigh Hoke, campaign director at Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans. Richard Sears - who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling - said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices. The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision-making and slipshod safety systems than cost-cutting, said Sears, who previously managed production projects at Shell. BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill, introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices, among other measures. The company says it cannot precisely estimate new spending on safety since the spill because its efforts are integrated into many parts of the company. In a glassed-in drilling shack on the Thunder Horse platform, operators stay connected to a new onshore command center in Houston that BP designed to monitor data from offshore wells. On the deck below sits a blowout preventer, a room-sized piece of equipment that would soon be fitted on the wellhead of a drilling site, two miles under water. But first it would need a safety inspection - unlike the blowout preventer that infamously failed to contain the 2010 spill, which federal regulators have said had not been inspected in years.

But a company known for engineering excellence is still trying to solve the very human problem of how to organize itself. Nearly two years ago, Google co-founder Larry Page announced the tech giant would be remade as Alphabet, a holding company whose units would include Google and an array of unrelated pursuits in areas such as healthcare, self-driving cars and urban planning. Wall Street cheered. Previously those riskier ventures had been lumped into Google's overall financial results. Investors would now see Google’s performance independent of its so-called “Other Bets,” an eclectic collection of 11 ventures. They include Nest, a maker of Wi-Fi enabled thermostats; Calico, which seeks to prolong the human lifespan; and X, the company's secretive research lab. Alphabet's top management also aimed to boost accountability by appointing chief executives to head each of the Other Bets. Few people in Google's constellation of ventures had ever held the title prior to that. But so far Alphabet has failed to show it can convert its Other Bets from experiments to businesses with the reach, impact and money-making potential of Google’s core search and advertising operations. Interviews with two dozen former Alphabet executives and employees reveal an organization grappling with how much time and resources Other Bets deserve in the pursuit of profitability. In the first quarter, which ended March 31, the ventures lost a combined $855 million; that's on top of a collective $3.6 billion loss for 2016. As a whole, Alphabet generated $90.3 billion in revenue in 2016. Google's share of that revenue was $89.5 billion, while its 2016 operating income was $27.9 billion. Alphabet's early days have seen more pruning than expansion of its holdings. The company has skinned back plans for Google Fiber, which delivers rapid Internet service in 10 metro areas. This month, Alphabet agreed to sell robotics company Boston Dynamics to Japanese multinational SoftBank Group Corp. It unloaded its Terra Bella satellite imaging business in February. At one point last year, it was even looking to sell Nest, the largest of the Other Bets, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Google paid an eye-popping $3.2 billion for the start-up in 2014. (For a graphic showing Alphabet's holdings, see: tmsnrt.rs/2rNgdKN) Meanwhile, a series of executives have departed since the reorganization, including the heads of Nest, an Internet operation called Access and a venture capital firm known as GV. An Alphabet spokeswoman declined repeated requests for comment or to make executives available for interviews. Supporters of the restructuring frame the early struggles as typical growing pains. For now, Wall Street isn't worried: Alphabet's stock is near an all-time high, having reached $1,000 per share in June. Ruth Porat, the no-nonsense chief financial officer who has steered the restructuring, has won rave reviews from investors for enforcing financial accountability across Alphabet. Some Other Bets have made notable strides. Life sciences initiative Verily recently attracted $800 million in outside investment. Self-driving car project Waymo is considered among the leaders in the burgeoning industry. Still, it's not yet clear the structure will enable Alphabet to do what most companies cannot: conceive the next wave of innovation in-house or through the development of key acquisitions. That goal is central to both the company's mission and investor expectations, analysts say. “The reason Google gets to trade at a decent multiple… is because there's a growth story beyond advertising,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. CEO or COO? The Alphabet structure is Google’s stab at an age-old corporate conundrum: sustaining innovation within a giant enterprise. Alphabet's strategy is to give entrepreneurs the autonomy of a startup, coupled with the discipline of a traditional corporate structure. Roughly once a quarter, Other Bets leaders meet with the Alphabet board – comprised of Porat, Page, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and David Drummond, Alphabet's senior vice president of corporate development – to discuss funding and performance, according to two former employees. At the same time, Alphabet is establishing separate compensation plans for the Other Bets to reward employees if their ventures succeed, mirroring startup incentives. The formula has primed Alphabet's emerging businesses for  global impact,  Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said this month at the annual stockholders meeting at the Mountain View headquarters.  There is one solution that we know works well in capitalism, which is boards, shareholders, CEOs,  Schmidt said.  My bet is that the traditional lessons of business organization will in fact result in success at Alphabet.  Still, Alphabet top brass continue to hold sway over key strategy and financing decisions, a dynamic that has chafed Other Bets chief executives who've complained they are treated more like chief operating officers than shot callers, according to people familiar with the situation. In addition, scrutiny from Wall Street limits how generous Alphabet can be in extending Google's resources to Other Bets, said Brian McClendon, a former vice president of engineering at Google.  As of yet, the restructuring hasn’t provided what I think is one of the immediate benefits, which is risk-taking investment,  he said. Nickeled and Dimed Some companies acquired by Google found that being part of Alphabet wasn't what they'd bargained for. Two former Nest employees said they were promised generous funding and time to achieve profitability following the company's acquisition by Google in 2014. But after the restructuring, Alphabet executives were keenly focused on revenue, one former employee said. Pricey overhead has made the path to profitability tougher. After the restructuring, Alphabet began charging Other Bets for their portion of shared services such as security and facilities, ending what had previously amounted to a subsidy, people familiar with the situation said. The units also felt pressure to maintain Google perks such as free employee meals. “One of the pitfalls (of Alphabet) is that those companies are asked to stand on their own two feet, but they may inherit the cost structure of Google,  said Nest investor Peter Nieh, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. In early 2016, Alphabet explored selling Nest in an effort code-named Project Amalfi, according to three people familiar with the matter. No deal materialized, and Nest co-founder Tony Fadell departed last year. Fadell declined to comment. Boston Dynamics, acquired in 2013 during a robotics shopping spree led by Android creator Andy Rubin, enjoyed generous funding at first. But it was adrift after Rubin's departure, two former employees said. Rubin did not respond to requests for comment. Grumpy Googlers The creation of the Other Bets has also changed what it means to work for Google. Some grumble that their role now is to subsidize innovation at their sister companies, rather than to innovate themselves. “It did sort of send the message to people who stayed back at Google, whether in search or in ads: Your job isn’t to push the envelope,” one former Googler said. Employee transfers to X, the illustrious “moonshot factory,” are more complicated now that it's a separate entity, former employees say. That’s a striking shift, especially for high-performing employees accustomed to moving about the company almost at will, said Punit Soni, a former Google employee who is now chief executive of Learning Motors, an artificial intelligence startup. “A basic premise of Google was people could do whatever they wanted,” Soni said. “I can see why people will feel like it’s no longer the old Google.  In the meantime, co-founder Page is pursuing yet another  moonshot : flying cars. He is the primary investor in Kitty Hawk, a startup in the field that is entirely outside the Alphabet umbrella.

Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has been at loggerheads with its Japanese partner over the sale of the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips, and is seeking a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent. The resubmission adds to uncertainty about whether Toshiba will sign a pact by Wednesday with the firm's preferred bidder - a group led by Japanese government investors and including Bain Capital that has offered around 2 trillion yen ($18 billion). The crisis-wracked Japanese conglomerate is rushing to sell the unit to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit and had set itself a deadline of Wednesday to sign what it has called a definitive agreement. Wednesday is the day of Toshiba's annual shareholders meeting and while an announcement of an agreement would look better at the meeting, the deadline is self-imposed. Western Digital will provide debt financing to facilitate a sale as part of the resubmitted bid, the U.S. firm said in a brief statement on Tuesday.  Sources with knowledge of the matter said a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) which are currently part of preferred bidder consortium - would be invited to join the resubmitted offer. The sources declined to be identified as the talks were confidential. It was not immediately clear if terms of the  offer had significantly changed from one tabled earlier this month that Western Digital has said met Toshiba's minimum requirement of 2 trillion yen. An INCJ spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for KKR and DBJ were not immediately available for comment. In response to Western Digital's resubmission, Toshiba released a statement reiterating that it has reviewed all proposals and is currently finalizing an agreement with the preferred bidder. Govt Approval  Toshiba has said its decision to choose the Japan government-Bain consortium as preferred bidder took into account concern about technology transfers, job security for its domestic workforce and prospects of clearing regulatory reviews. The consortium, whose bid has largely been orchestrated by Japan's trade ministry, would also have an implicit stamp of approval from the government which is keen to keep key semiconductor technology under domestic control. Toshiba cannot afford to ignore the government because it needs its help with plans including the decommissioning of domestic nuclear power plants and as overseas nuclear power projects are currently in limbo after the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear unit. But the possibility that Western Digital may be granted an injunction to stop or unwind a sale is complicating efforts to reach a deal. A U.S. court hearing on the injunction request has been scheduled for July 14. Members of the Japan government-Bain consortium have told Toshiba that it needs to resolve its spat with Western Digital before they will make any investment, sources familiar with the matter have said previously. Toshiba Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa said last Friday that the Japanese firm was open to talks with Western Digital although it was not willing to make the first move. Western Digital had not found favor on price and because the U.S. firm was keen to take control of the unit, he said, adding that he expected executives from Toshiba to still be running operations after the sale.  Western Digital has said that it will pursue further litigation if the government-led consortium wins. In particular, it is unhappy with the inclusion of South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) in the group, saying it increases the likelihood of technology leaks to a rival. Although SK Hynix is not expected to take an equity stake in the group, it will provide half of the 850 billion yen that Bain will put up in the form of financing, sources have said. Sources have also said that Western Digital's concerns about SK Hynix are shared by some Toshiba board members. SK Hynix has declined to comment on the matter.

The Fed's Chair, Janet Yellen, is scheduled to take part in a discussion in London later on Tuesday. Investors expect her to underline her positive view on the U.S. economy, which would support the Fed's forecast of a rate hike this year. But softer-than-expected U.S. data overnight gave rise to some caution. New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter.  Her words will be scrutinized for any colour about the timing of the next rate hike against a backdrop of mounting concerns over the inflation outlook,  strategists at Societe Generale said in a note to clients. US stock futures  were off 0.1 percent. The dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of six major currencies, though it hit a five-week high against the Japanese yen. A packed roster of top central bank officials speaking at various events kept volumes light and investors cautious. Also due to speak on Tuesday were Fed officials Patrick Harker and Neel Kashkari. Fed officials have stuck to their hawkish scripts, in stark contrast to the firmly dovish view expressed by Draghi against exiting super easy monetary policy too quickly. Draghi reiterated his views at an ECB conference in Portugal but also highlighted the continued recovery in the euro zone. His comments helped bond yields in the single-currency bloc nudge higher and lifted the euro to a nine-day high. In Britain, the Bank of England raised banks' capital requirements and warned about levels of credit growth in pockets of the economy. Worries about an extended consumer binge have weighed on the outlook for the country's retailers, spurring some hedge funds to double down on bearish bets on the sector. The BoE said it was continuing to oversee banks' preparations for Brexit, including for if Britain exits the European Union in 2019 without securing any trade deal, cutting off banks from their European customers, which could undermine financial stability. European stocks gave up some of their gains from the previous session, dragged lower by weakness in consumer-related stocks. Autos in particular were hit after a profit-warning from German parts maker Schaeffler. In other corporate news, the EU slapped a record 2.42 billion euro fine on Alphabet's Google saying it had abused its dominant market position. Google said it was considering an appeal. More broadly, firmer metals and oil prices as well as upbeat data on Chinese industrial profits helped mining shares recover recent losses. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, gained 1.2 percent to $46.39 per barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 1 percent to $43.83 per barrel. Gold prices, which tumbled to their lowest level in nearly six weeks on Monday after large sell order sent ripples through the market, steadied, supported by an easing dollar. Spot gold was up 0.6 percent to $1251.21 per ounce.

Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has been at loggerheads with its Japanese partner over the sale of the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips, and is seeking a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent. The resubmission adds to uncertainty about whether Toshiba will sign a pact by Wednesday with the firm's preferred bidder - a group led by Japanese government investors and including Bain Capital that has offered around 2 trillion yen ($18 billion). The crisis-wracked Japanese conglomerate is rushing to sell the unit to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit and had set itself a deadline of Wednesday to sign what it has called a definitive agreement. Wednesday is the day of Toshiba's annual shareholders meeting and while an announcement of an agreement would look better at the meeting, the deadline is self-imposed. Western Digital will provide debt financing to facilitate a sale as part of the resubmitted bid, the U.S. firm said in a brief statement on Tuesday.  Sources with knowledge of the matter said a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) which are currently part of preferred bidder consortium - would be invited to join the resubmitted offer. The sources declined to be identified as the talks were confidential. It was not immediately clear if terms of the  offer had significantly changed from one tabled earlier this month that Western Digital has said met Toshiba's minimum requirement of 2 trillion yen. An INCJ spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for KKR and DBJ were not immediately available for comment. In response to Western Digital's resubmission, Toshiba released a statement reiterating that it has reviewed all proposals and is currently finalizing an agreement with the preferred bidder. Govt Approval  Toshiba has said its decision to choose the Japan government-Bain consortium as preferred bidder took into account concern about technology transfers, job security for its domestic workforce and prospects of clearing regulatory reviews. The consortium, whose bid has largely been orchestrated by Japan's trade ministry, would also have an implicit stamp of approval from the government which is keen to keep key semiconductor technology under domestic control. Toshiba cannot afford to ignore the government because it needs its help with plans including the decommissioning of domestic nuclear power plants and as overseas nuclear power projects are currently in limbo after the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear unit. But the possibility that Western Digital may be granted an injunction to stop or unwind a sale is complicating efforts to reach a deal. A U.S. court hearing on the injunction request has been scheduled for July 14. Members of the Japan government-Bain consortium have told Toshiba that it needs to resolve its spat with Western Digital before they will make any investment, sources familiar with the matter have said previously. Toshiba Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa said last Friday that the Japanese firm was open to talks with Western Digital although it was not willing to make the first move. Western Digital had not found favor on price and because the U.S. firm was keen to take control of the unit, he said, adding that he expected executives from Toshiba to still be running operations after the sale.  Western Digital has said that it will pursue further litigation if the government-led consortium wins. In particular, it is unhappy with the inclusion of South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) in the group, saying it increases the likelihood of technology leaks to a rival. Although SK Hynix is not expected to take an equity stake in the group, it will provide half of the 850 billion yen that Bain will put up in the form of financing, sources have said. Sources have also said that Western Digital's concerns about SK Hynix are shared by some Toshiba board members. SK Hynix has declined to comment on the matter.

Fitch has also revised the Outlook for the Society of Lloyds to Negative from Stable while affirming the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating at 'A+'. The subordinated bonds have been affirmed at 'A-' KEY RATING DRIVERS The Outlook has been revised to Negative because of deterioration in underwriting performance, coupled with increasing exposure to catastrophe risk in the context of continuing pressure on both risk-adjusted premium rates and expense ratios at Lloyd's. The Fitch-calculated combined ratio of 98% was a significant deterioration from recent performance, driven by a return to more normalised levels of catastrophe activity in the market as well as increasing expenses and falling risk-adjusted premium rates. Lloyd's exposure to worldwide natural and man-made catastrophes is higher than peers'. This is reflected in Lloyd's combined ratio being more sensitive to catastrophic events. Fitch believes that exposure to catastrophe risk has increased in recent years despite declining margins on this line of business. However, Fitch believes that Lloyd's exposure management, through the group's modelling capabilities and the reinsurance in place, allows the market to mitigate tail risks to some extent. The 'very strong' business profile of Lloyd's of London's supports its rating. It is one of a select band of global (re)insurance providers capable of attracting high-quality and specialised business. It operates as a global insurance and reinsurance market comprising more than 100 syndicates. It writes business from over 200 countries and territories, and in 2016 reported gross written premiums of GBP29.9 billion. Fitch expects capitalisation to support the rating, assuming future losses fall within the limits expected by Lloyd's. The three-layered capital structure at Lloyd's - syndicates' premium trust funds, members' funds at Lloyd's and the central fund - remained strong in 2016, despite the impact of weaker sterling relative to the dollar and increasing catastrophe exposure. Debt is very limited in the capital structure with a financial leverage ratio of 3% at end-2016. In 2016, Lloyd's results benefitted from foreign exchange gains as a result of the depreciation of sterling and investment returns also improved, driven by a downward shift in bond yields. Overall, Lloyd's net investment income rose to GBP1.3 billion in 2016 (2015: GBP0.4 billion) and foreign exchange gains contributed GBP0.6 billion (2015: GBP0.1 billion loss) to profits which helped to offset a weaker underwriting result in the same period. Fitch views these market movements as being one-off in nature. Fitch believes that Lloyd's maintains a disciplined approach to underwriting, reinforced by the strong oversight of the Performance Management Directorate (PMD). Underwriting conditions across almost all major (re)insurance classes are deteriorating, and Fitch anticipates that Lloyd's will continue to scale back exposures in the worst affected lines to reflect the weak pricing environment. RATING SENSITIVITIES A downgrade may occur if the net combined ratio remains above 97% for a prolonged period. An extended period of underperformance or a proportionally larger net catastrophe loss versus peers or market share could also lead to a downgrade. The Outlook may be revised to Stable if Fitch anticipates an improvement in Lloyd's underwriting performance to a level commensurate with peers' or if it reduces its capital exposure to catastrophe losses.

By Amanda Ferguson BELFAST (Reuters) - Irish nationalists Sinn Fein said on Monday the money coming in to Northern Ireland from a pact by their pro-British rivals to prop up British Prime Minister Theresa May would not in itself help restore the province's regional administration. But Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said that it might help if it gave the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) confidence to do what his side deems necessary to restore power-sharing. May struck the deal with the DUP to support her Conservative government in major votes, pledging at least 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in extra funds to the province, a windfall DUP leader Arlene Foster said would bring the prospect of a political solution in the British province closer. However Sinn Fein, who pulled out of power-sharing with the DUP in January, prompting an election and a series of missed deadlines to restore the regional assembly, said the issues that led to the collapse remain.  I think not, no,  Adams said when asked if Foster's deal boosting infrastructure, education and health spending in the United Kingdom's smallest region would influence talks ahead of deadline in Belfast on Thursday.  The Assembly (broke) down on issues which are mostly rights-based issues. As we stand here today, we are still in that position. If it (the deal with May) empowers the DUP, if it emboldens the DUP then to do what they should be doing then, yes that would be something very, very positive.  Adams criticized some parts of the agreement - saying it provided a  blank cheque  for a Brexit -- Britain leaving the European Union -- that threatens peace in Northern Ireland. But he also acknowledged that the funds could help to ease  the enormous pressure  on public services. Many analysts believe a deal that boosts funding while not damaging Irish nationalist interests could motivate Sinn Fein to agree to return to government. Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney said there were still significant gaps between Sinn Fein and the DUP. Northern Ireland risks reverting to direct rule from London for the first time in a decade if power-sharing is not restored. May's relying on the DUP to stay in power has been criticized for potentially putting the British government on one side of the power-sharing agreement. But the agreement stated that the DUP will have no involvement in the British government's role in political talks in Northern Ireland and that both parties would adhere fully to a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence. May's wish that the province's executive decide how to spend the funds put pressure on the two sides ahead of Thursday's deadline, but a spokesman for May's Conservative Party said that if it proved impossible to re-establish power-sharing, then the responsibility would fall to it and the DUP.  I know who I'd like to do the spending,  said Colum Eastwood, leader of the smaller nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP).   I'd like an inclusive executive that represents all of the people of Northern Ireland to be making sure that money is spent properly and for all of our benefit, and not being spent by a Tory party who seem to be under the thumb of the DUP. I think that'd be a very dangerous place for all of us.  Writing by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-nireland-idUSKBN19H220"},

It means the DUP's 10 lawmakers will now vote in support of May's 318 Conservatives in the 650-seat parliament on the budget, legislative agenda, motions of confidence and Brexit. In return, May agreed to at least 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in extra funding over two years for Northern Ireland, agreeing to raise pensions annually by at least 2.5 percent and to keep universal winter fuel payments for the elderly.  I welcome this agreement, which will enable us to work together in the interest of the whole United Kingdom, give us the certainty we require as we embark on our departure from the European Union, and help us build a stronger and fairer society at home,  May said in a statement.  May linked her deal with an attempt to end Northern Ireland's political crisis by stipulating the money would only be released to a power-sharing executive in Belfast, raising pressure on the DUP to come to an agreement with their Catholic nationalist rivals. However a Conservative party spokesman said that there would be a mechanism for the money to be released via a consultative committee even without a deal to restore power-sharing. Related CoverageSinn Fein says Northern Ireland billion-pound windfall no guarantee of power-sharing dealDublin welcomes greater Northern Irish Brexit voice after DUP, May dealSinn Fein says DUP, May deal a 'blank cheque' for damaging Brexit The Conservative Party has recognized the case for higher funding in Northern Ireland given our unique history and circumstances over recent decades,  DUP leader Foster told reporters in Downing Street.  We welcome this new financial support of 1 billion pounds.  Leaders of Scotland and Wales voiced anger at the deal, saying it would weaken, not strengthen, the ties that bind the United Kingdom by  throwing money  at one of its devolved regions at the expense of others.  Today's deal represents a straight bung to keep a weak prime minister and a faltering government in office,  said Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones of the Labour party. Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:  In concluding this grubby, shameless deal, the Tories (Conservatives) have shown that they will stop at nothing to hold on to power – even sacrificing the very basic principles of devolution.  Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, shakes hands with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds, in Downing Street, in central London, Britain June 26, 2017.Neil hallGerry Adams, president of the Irish Catholic nationalist Sinn Fein party, said the deal provides a  blank cheque  for a Brexit that threatens peace in Northern Ireland. The deal with the DUP, which won 292,316 votes in the June 8 election, will run for the life of the current parliament due to end in 2022 but will be reviewed after each parliamentary session and most of the funding is due in the first two years. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn questioned how the government had found a billion pounds given planned spending cuts, which he said should now be canceled for all the United Kingdom, not just the province of Northern Ireland.  Even with DUP lawmakers onside, May's effective majority is slim and her position remains insecure though she has promised to extricate the Conservatives from what she termed the  mess  of the election. Slideshow (14 Images)Her strategy for a complete break of Britain from the EU is under scrutiny and her future as prime minister is the subject of public debate with speculation that she could be challenged from within her own party within months.  Fragile Peace in Northern Ireland  While May negotiated the DUP deal, senior Conservatives such as ex-Prime Minister John Major raised concerns the deal risks pitching the province back into turmoil by convincing  hard men  on both sides of the sectarian divide to return to violence. The fear was that increasing the influence of pro-British unionists over the British government could create the perception that London was no longer an honest broker of the peace settlement reached in 1998. The U.S.-brokered Good Friday agreement brought an end to three decades of violence in Northern Ireland that killed 3,600 people. Northern Ireland has been in crisis since Sinn Fein pulled out of its government in January, prompting an election in March and a series of missed deadlines to restore the compulsory coalition between Catholic nationalists and pro-British Protestant unionists.  I will be returning to Northern Ireland to continue our discussions as we attempt to re-establish the Northern Ireland Executive,  Foster said.  Now more than ever, political leaders, both locally and nationally, need to work together to find solutions for all the people we serve.   The latest deadline set by May's government for the parties in Northern Ireland to reach a deal is Thursday. Sinn Fein said the extra money for Northern Ireland would not in itself guarantee that power-sharing in the province would be restored by the new deadline.   Time is running short for the parties to come together and reach agreement to re-establish power-sharing,  May said.  Northern Ireland needs a functioning devolved government at this important time.

But any change in the bank's stance, which includes sub-zero rates and massive bond purchases, should be gradual as  considerable  monetary support is still needed and the rebound in inflation will also depend on favourable global financing conditions.  A constant policy stance will become more accommodative, and the central bank can accompany the recovery by adjusting the parameters of its policy instruments – not in order to tighten the policy stance, but to keep it broadly unchanged,  Draghi told an ECB conference in Sintra, Portugal. His comments sent the euro half a percent higher as investors took them as a signal the ECB was preparing to announce a cut in massive bond purchases as soon as September. With its 2.3-trillion-euro asset buys running until the end of the year, the ECB will have to decide in the third quarter whether to extend or wind down the purchases, reconciling an apparent contradiction between healthy growth and weak inflation.  Today Draghi moved his first step towards indicating that ECB monetary policy will become less accommodative in 2018,  UniCredit economic Marco Valli said.  Unless an unexpected shock materialises, a formal tapering announcement is likely to come at the ECB monetary policy meeting scheduled on 7 September.  But Draghi also played down expectations for a speedy withdrawal of stimulus, suggesting that any normalisation will be drawn out.  There are strong grounds for prudence in the adjustment of monetary policy parameters, even when accompanying the recovery,  he said.  Any adjustments to our stance have to be made gradually, and only when the improving dynamics that justify them appear sufficiently secure.  Growth accelerating and holding firmly above trends argues for a reduction in stimulus but persistent labour market slack and commodity price shocks bolster arguments for restraint. Inflation has undershot the ECB's target of almost 2 percent for over four years but Draghi also hinted at a willingness to look through some of the factors holding down price growth.  While there are still factors that are weighing on the path of inflation, at present they are mainly temporary factors that typically the central bank can look through,  he said.  All the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area. Deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones.

The world's three leading offshore wind operators - DONG Energy, EnBW and Vattenfall - all told Reuters they were looking to these megaturbines to help adapt to the upcoming reality with dwindling government handouts.  According to interviews with turbine makers and engineers, at least one manufacturer - Siemens Gamesa - will have built a prototype megaturbine by next year and the first farms could be up and running in the first half of the next decade.  These massive machines will each stand 300 meters tall – almost as high as London's Shard, western Europe's tallest building - with 200-metre rotor spans that will stretch the length of two football fields.     The wind power sector is at a critical juncture as the subsidies that have cradled it since its inception in the early 1990s, and underpinned its business model, disappear as politicians enact a long-planned push to make the industry more commercially viable and able to compete with other energy sources.  The countries that form the hub of the European offshore wind industry - Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain - are looking to gradually phase out the handouts over the next decade. This will end a crucial source of revenue for operators; in tenders concluded as recently as 2014, subsidies still accounted for around half of European wind projects' income.  With the writing on the wall, DONG and EnBW submitted bids with no subsidies factored in at a tender in April for a German project planned for 2024. The auction represented an industry milestone, the first with zero-subsidy bids, but raised the burning question of how operators will be able to make money and survive while offering a commercially attractive alternative to coal and nuclear.  The answer, according to the companies, are the megaturbines, which would sweep a far bigger area and harness more wind, cutting costs per megawatt. They will each generate between 10 and 15 megawatts (MW) of power - a considerable leap from the largest turbines currently in operation, made by MHI Vestas, which are 195 meters tall and generate 8 MW.  The megaturbines are no sure bet for the companies' bottom lines, however.  There are challenges on the technical front to create monumentally tall towers and light, slender blades that can withstand the strain of gale-force winds.  Economically, there are also doubts among some industry experts about whether zero-subsidy wind projects can make money, even with the increased efficiency delivered by megaturbines.  They say deeper savings must be made by operators across their businesses and electricity prices must also rise significantly to bring profitability.  Michael Guldbrandtsen, offshore wind consultant at MAKE, said there were financial and technical risks associated with megaturbines, but that operators had little choice but to invest in a technology needed to make zero-subsidy projects viable.   Without a significant increase in the size of turbines it would not be possible to ensure a reasonable return,  he added.  Prototype Megaturbine  Operators are nonetheless banking on the new technology.  Michael Simmelsgaard, head of offshore business at Swedish utility Vattenfall, said the industry would cross the 10 MW turbine threshold  faster than many expect now , without being more specific. A 10 W turbine could power about 9,000 homes.   We will definitely see these big turbines,  he added.  FILE PHOTO: Wind turbines are seen in a wind park off the coast of Ijmuiden, the Netherlands, September 3, 2007.Michael Kooren/File PhotoDONG Energy's wind business, Samuel Leupold, laid out more ambitious plans:  We believe we can utilize (turbines) in the range of 13 to 15 megawatts,  he said on the sidelines of an offshore wind conference in London this month - the first time an industry executive has given such a high figure. Previously, companies have only spoken about turbines in the region of 10W.  EnBW also said it was turning to megaturbines.   Size is an important driver of efficiency,  said Dirk Guesewell, its head of generation portfolio development.  Bigger rotors mean fewer turbines and foundations are needed to achieve the same capacity.   German turbine maker Senvion said it was developing megaturbines of over 10 MW. While the machines are still in the design stage, it said it was already offering them for future use to wind farm operators.   We envisage that the installations of those wind farms will take place in the first half of the next decade,  head of Senvion's Global Offshore business, Cornelius Druecker, told Reuters without saying how close the firm was to a prototype.  An independent engineer working with Siemens Gamesa, who asked not to be named as they are authorized to speak publicly, said the German company will have built a prototype megaturbine by next year. Another engineer, who works with several big turbine makers, said designs had almost been completed across the sector and the process of producing prototypes was about to start.   Siemens Gamesa declined to comment.  Slideshow (3 Images)Technical Hurdles  The biggest technical hurdle involves increasing the length of the turbine blades without putting too much strain on the structure which is built on a platform fastened to the seabed.  With spans of around 200 meters, the blades will be about 50 meters longer than those of the most powerful turbines now in operation.  As they are constantly exposed to different levels of wind, their construction, which requires adhesives that join different layers of carbon or glass-fiber to dry at exactly the right temperatures, is extremely complex.  Denmark's state research institute DTU Wind Energy, which has propelled much of the innovation in wind power, is working on keeping down the weight of these super-long blades by bumping up the carbon fiber content. They have designed blade features similar to the flaps on aeroplane wings to control and reduce load variations so turbulence does not break the blades.   Most people understand it is complicated to make calculations on an airplane or a helicopter, but turbines are at least as complicated and it is the same methods we use,  said Flemming Rasmussen, the institute's head of aerodynamic design.  When mass production begins, new factories will be needed with enough space for the blades.  Do Numbers Add Up?  No operator is prepared to publicly disclose the calculations and projections that underpins its strategy, citing commercial sensitivity.  Even with megaturbines in place, the operators would also need other things to go their way to turn a profit without state subsidies - crucially, electricity prices must rise to a level where profitability outstrips investment costs.  Bernstein researchers calculated that, at their current power price forecast, operators would need to reduce their capital expenditure (capex) by around 60 percent for zero-subsidy projects to break even. Increasing turbine sizes from 7 MW to 14 MW would reduce capex by around 40 percent, they added.  The researchers expect a 5-6 euros a megawatt hour (MWh) rise from current power market prices of 30 euros/MWh by 2023.   Cost reductions and power prices will have to be consistently much higher than our predictions for the subsidy free projects to break even,  they said.

The defection by several Monetary Policy Committee officials to the camp supporting a rise in base interest rates has given the pound, battered by another round of political uncertainty after this month's elections, some support in the past week. On the one hand, reinstating the 0.5 percent of risk-weighted assets banks are asked to hold as a buffer against shocks to consumer finances was a sign of confidence in an economy which has looked to be slowing. But it may also take any unwanted steam out of areas of loan growth which could otherwise be cited as one reason for raising rates, helping policymakers hold off for longer with any hike in the Bank's main borrowing rates.  When you're looking at the buffer, they have increased it and that is a marginal tightening of monetary conditions, and hence possibly a plus for the pound,  said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam.  The interesting thing for the next few hours is will people see it as the compromise between policymakers that lets them agree to leave rates where they are for now? Sterling is drifting off now and we may see a further retreat.  After jumping around 0.2 percent to as high as $1.2770 immediately after the Bank's announcement, the pound retreated to trade just 0.1 percent higher on the day at $1.2735. It fell half a percent to 88.29 pence per euro. Derek Halpenny, a strategist with MUFG in London, has been one of the bank analysts calling for a rise in sterling in recent months, judging the worst of the pound's Brexit-led sell-off is now in the price. But he also says the uncertainty generated by Prime Minister Theresa May's loss of her parliamentary majority in elections on June 8 has made it harder for sterling to rise in the near term. May has sealed the deal she needs to approve a stripped-down legislative programme, but many political commentators still expect another election to be called in the next year under a new Conservative leader. After initial salvos on EU citizens' rights in the past week, Halpenny said it will be how the rest of the talks on Britain's departure from the European Union pan out that should be crucial to sterling in the coming weeks.  While macroeconomics might start to have a greater influence, the big events are still Brexit related,  he said.

OPEC and 11 other exporters agreed in May to extend cuts in production, despite which markets have remained well supplied due to rising output elsewhere.     Firming oil prices helped lift Southeast Asian markets a little higher, coupled with window-dressing, as the end of the first half approaches, said Joseph Roxas, an analyst with Manila-based Eagle Equities.     Meanwhile, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to take part in a discussion in London later on Tuesday. Investors expect her to underline her positive view on the U.S. economy, which would support the Fed's forecast of a rate hike this year.     Philippine shares closed 0.8 percent higher with International Container Terminal Services gaining 4.5 percent. Semirara Mining  rose one percent.     The new Philippines environment minister Roy Cimatu said he may decide next month on the fate of dozens of mining operations and contracts that have been ordered closed, suspended or cancelled in order to protect watersheds and other natural resources.     Singapore shares edged up 0.3 percent led by gains industrials and financials.      Keppel Corp and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation gained 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.      Bucking the trend, Vietnam shares ended 0.7 percent lower after briefly touching a nine-year intraday high.      With a disappointing first quarter growth of 5.1 percent year-on-year, the risk is that overall (Vietnam) GDP growth for this year will once again fall short of the official target of 6.7 percent , DBS Group said in a note.

The risks were on full display on Tuesday when shares in Debenhams (DEB.L) slid more than 3 percent to an eight-year low following a weak trading update and a warning on UK sales. Britain's upcoming exit from the European Union, an inconclusive general election, and worrying data on consumer spending have muddied the outlook for bricks-and-mortar retailers like Debenhams, Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) and Next (NXT.L), whose share prices have fallen this year. Short-sellers, who borrow shares in a company before selling them into the market, hoping to buy them back at a lower price in the future and pocket the difference, are doubling down. Of the 10 most-shorted stocks in the UK, five – M&S;, Debenhams, Pets At Home (PETSP.L) and grocers Morrisons (MRW.L) and Ocado (OCDO.L) – are now in the retail sector, according to data from UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority.   This comes after sofa retailer DFS (DFSD.L) warned on June 15 that it would miss expectations on profits this year, blaming an uncertain political and economic outlook, and that the lack of demand was “market-wide”. DFS's comments sent a stock index tracking Britain’s retailers .FTASX5370 down 4.1 percent on June 15 – its biggest one-day fall since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016.  That was followed a day later by Amazon (AMZN.O) announcing its intention to buy Whole Foods (WFM.O), stoking fears the online giant may push further into retail. Analysts and investors are braced for further weakness. “Traditional clothing retailers are an area where I find it much harder to see how the pressure is going to go away,” said Matthew Tillett, a fund manager at Allianz Global Investors. “I am always asking, ‘is it Amazon-able?’ If the answer to that question is ‘yes’ it is always going to be hard for me to buy a bricks and mortar retailer.” UK retail sales fell more sharply than expected in May, data from the Office of National Statistics showed on the same day as the DFS profit warning, with non-food retailers particularly badly affected.  “It is a tough backdrop,” said Tineke Frikkee, a fund manager at Smith & Williamson. It owns shares in M&S; and Debenhams, both of which have seen increases in short interest in the last week. “The response shows you the glass is half empty on these stocks,” Frikkee said. In particular, DFS’s profit warning and Amazon’s expansion have coincided with a spike in short-selling in M&S; and Debenhams.  Of the 11 funds short M&S;’s shares, six increased their positions on June 15 and 16, according to regulatory filings. Short interest in the retailer, which primarily sells clothing and food, has risen more than five-fold to 10.2 percent since the start of the year.   Hedge funds shorting M&S; include Marshall Wace, which has a 2.3 percent position in the company’s shares and is also shorting pet food retailer Pets At Home. At around 130 million pounds ($166 million), the bet against M&S; is one of the fund’s largest shorts in the UK. Marshall Wace declined to comment.  Debenhams, already one of the UK’s most shorted stocks, has seen short interest nearly double since the start of the year to reach an all-time high of 11.9 percent.  Odey Asset Management, run by billionaire investor Crispin Odey, increased its position to nearly 4 percent of the company’s shares on June 15, according to filings. The firm did not respond to requests for comment.    Shorting the sector has been a successful trade so far in 2017: Pets At Home has fallen 33 percent and Debenhams has lost more than a fifth of its value this year. M&S; is down 3 percent.

Technology can pave the way to improvements in data management, training for health workers and making referrals, among other areas, she added.  The June 27-28 meeting in Kigali will focus on forging new partnerships between governments, U.N. agencies, civil society organizations and the private sector in Africa to deliver universal health coverage. That means ensuring everyone can obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship to pay for them. Every year, 11 million Africans fall into poverty due to high out-of-pocket payments for healthcare, a WHO report said last year.  Achieving universal health coverage - including access to essential health services, medicines and vaccines for all - is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the world’s governments in 2015 and intended to be met by 2030.  The WHO plans to team up with the International Telecommunication Union and African governments to support the large-scale adoption of “eHealth” services, it said.  These cover everything from telephone helplines and text message appointment reminders, to remote patient monitoring, electronic health registers, online learning for staff and promoting health messages through social media.  While most African countries have universal health coverage as a goal in their health strategies, progress in implementing these has been slow, according to the World Bank. At present, the main challenge is financing, said Moeti. “The benefit allocation for health in many of the African countries does not represent (the) $80 per capita that the WHO recommends for a basic package of healthcare services - although a few countries are getting there,” she said. Lack of skilled human resources is also “a very important problem” in some African countries, which suffer from a shortage of trained doctors, nurses and midwives, she added. The Africa region accounts for approximately a quarter of the world’s disease burden, yet has just 3 percent of its doctors, the WHO noted in 2015.  Moeti said the delivery of health services also needs to be more integrated to overcome silos, particularly with programs tackling Africa’s biggest health challenges such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and maternal mortality.  “Innovation needs to be around how to do smart integration, to convince the health sectors to drive change but also to be more efficient,” she said.

A scarcity of skilled workers risks slowing the pace at which Europe’s biggest economy can expand. One way to plug the gap is to attract workers who no longer feel welcome in the United Kingdom after its vote to leave the European Union. After more than a decade of strong growth and rising employment, German companies are struggling to hire qualified workers. A record 1.1 million jobs were vacant in the first quarter of 2017, 40 percent more than five years earlier, data from think tank IAB shows. A persistent skills shortage would reduce the maximum sustainable rate at which the economy can grow in the long term from 1.4 percent to 1.2 percent by 2019, the German central bank said on Monday. True, more than 1 million migrants entered Germany in 2015 after Chancellor Angela Merkel threw open the borders to war refugees. But only half of these newcomers have the skills to find work in the coming five years, IAB economists predict. Workers from other European countries may slot into jobs more easily. The number of EU citizens employed in Germany has already more than doubled over the past decade, to 1.8 million, or 6 percent of the workforce. If British Prime Minister Theresa May cuts EU migration as sharply as she has promised, many of the 250,000 or so European workers who move to Britain each year will look elsewhere for work. Germany, whose unemployment rate has fallen to 5.7 percent, its lowest since reunification in 1990, is an obvious alternative. Even before Britain leaves the EU, applications for UK social security numbers from eastern European countries have fallen to their lowest level since 2004, according to the University of Oxford’s Migration Observatory. By contrast, there were 15 percent more workers from these countries in Germany in March than a year ago. Berlin could do more to encourage such inflows, for example by subsidising language training and running hiring campaigns in other European countries. Germany is already trying to persuade British bankers to move to Frankfurt. By rolling out the red carpet for Polish plumbers, Spanish engineers and Romanian nurses too, the country can make the most of Brexit.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Sitting with her parents when she was 11, Chau watched the 2008 Beijing Olympics on television in awe and felt  excitement in the heart  as China's athletes swept the board with 48 gold medals, more than any other nation.  I thought China was great,  Chau said.  If you asked me back then if I was Chinese, I'd say yes.  Fast forward nine years, however, and the former British colony's first post-handover generation is increasingly turning its back on the mainland.  Now ... I don't want to say I am Chinese,  said Chau, who was arrested during mass pro-democracy protests in 2014.  It gives me a very negative feeling. Even if you ask me 100 times, I would say the same thing.  According to a University of Hong Kong survey released on Tuesday that polled 120 youths, only 3.1 percent of those aged between 18 to 29 identify themselves as  broadly Chinese . The figure stood at 31 percent when the regular half-yearly survey started 20 years ago. In interviews with 10 Hong Kong youths born in 1997 including Chau, all of them, including an immigrant from mainland China, told Reuters they primarily identify themselves as  Hong Kongers  and their loyalty lies with the city. The territory became a British colony in stages in the 19th century and returned to Chinese rule under a  one country, two systems  formula which guarantees it wide-ranging autonomy, including an independent judiciary and freedom of speech, for at least 50 years. The 20-year-olds' attitudes were hardened, they said, by a series of shadowy maneuvers suggesting a slow squeeze on those freedoms by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. Graphic on public opinion: tmsnrt.rs/2sw6cDG In 2012, a skinny 15-year-old student named Joshua Wong led tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents to protest against a mandatory national education curriculum they claimed would  brainwash  students by promoting Chinese patriotism. The curriculum was eventually shelved. Two years later, the  Occupy  movement, with Wong at the helm, sought to pressure Beijing to allow full democracy in the election of its leader, demands that were ultimately ignored after 79 days of street protests. The abduction of several Hong Kong booksellers by mainland agents and China's efforts to disqualify two young lawmakers who support Hong Kong independence have also shaken confidence in the  one-country, two systems  arrangement. Student Candy Lau fears Hong Kong will become more controlled. Kalok Leung, who was born four months after the Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule in 1997, poses with his childhood photo which was taken at the same spot in 2002, at Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong, China June 15, 2017.Tyrone Siu You see how mass surveillance is so pervasive in China. If Hong Kong gets worse, it may become that way, and it may not become safe anymore,  she said.  It's an invisible fear.      Love the Country  More and more youngsters are now pushing for the right to self-determination, and even independence, alarming Beijing. Last month, Beijing's No. 3 official, Zhang Dejiang, who also oversees Hong Kong issues, stressed the need to  strengthen national education and legal education to Hong Kong's youth, and develop correct concepts about the country from a young age  so that they could be moulded into those who  love the country . Slideshow (7 Images)Hong Kong's incoming leader, Carrie Lam, speaking to China's Xinhua state news agency, said she would seek to cultivate the concept of  I am Chinese  at nursery level.  More than 120,000 Hong Kong youths will join China-related exchange programs, some sponsored by the Hong Kong government, as part of the handover's 20th anniversary celebrations, according to Xinhua. But this patriotic push could trigger a greater backlash.  How could the government not understand the more it forces Hong Kong people to love China, the more opposition this would draw?  asked 20-year-old Jojo Wong, no relation to Joshua. Even more moderate students like Felix Wu, who says he's apathetic about politics, chooses to identify himself first as a Hong Konger, before his Han Chinese ethnicity.  China is a pretty big market and Hong Kong has a need to integrate with this market,  Wu said.  But politically they promised nothing would change for 50 years. I think they're going back on their word a bit.  Ludovic Chan, a business student hoping to join the civil service, sees himself first as a Hong Konger, but doesn't think that identity is in conflict with being Chinese.  The two different cultures can co-exist. They shouldn't always say Hong Kong and China should integrate. But the two sides should try to understand each other more.  Some mainland Chinese students studying in Hong Kong also look on the bright side.   Twenty years is just a start,  said Yoshi Yue, a business student who has been in the city for three years.  Slowly they will develop a sense of belonging. It comes from culture, not politics.

It did not give any details on the function of the proposed entity, what form it would take, or on staffing. Several other banks are preparing to shift their EU base to Frankfurt from London.

The Confederation of British Industry said its monthly retail sales balance rose to +12 in June, stronger than a median forecast of +2 in a Reuters poll of economists. The balance had slumped to a four-month low of +2 in May. Expectations for July fell to +3, matching a low last hit in September.  The start of summer has seen shoppers hit the high street, lifting sales - if only modestly,  Anna Leach, the CBI's head of economic intelligence, said.  However, there's no getting away from the fact that life is getting tougher, with retailers clearly cautious over the near-term outlook,  she said. The CBI said sales were broadly in line with seasonal norms. A rise in inflation to nearly 3 percent and a slowing of wage growth took some of the momentum out of consumer demand and the broader economy in early 2017. A survey of consumer confidence published earlier on Tuesday showed households turned more downbeat after Britain's messy election outcome and the latest signs of a weakening of the housing market. The Bank of England, whose interest-rate setters split 5-3 this month on the need to raise borrowing costs to see off a rise in inflation, is waiting to see how consumers respond to the political uncertainty caused by Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to win a parliamentary majority.

While financial technology is changing how financial services and information are being delivered, there is no evidence that services like crowdfunding,  robo  advice and cloud computing will fundamentally change underlying activities such as lending, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) said in a report published on Tuesday. The findings of the FSB, which coordinates regulation for the Group of 20 Economies (G20), signal no immediate rush to bring in new rules at the global level to mitigate financial stability risks. Regulators have taken a relatively relaxed approach to fintech, given its tiny size compared to banks with investment totaling $21 billion in the first nine months of 2016, but the FSB said it would keep monitoring the sector. Apart from potential risks, fintech offers potential benefits as well, such as greater efficiency, transparency, competition and resilience of the financial system, and economic growth, it said.  The FSB will continue to monitor and discuss the evolution of the potential financial stability implications of fintech developments,  it said. A lack of data is also making it harder to assess financial stability threats, and regulators don't want to stifle a new sector with heavy handed rules. Fintech activities are already covered within broader financial rules, and many countries are already planning to take further measures to protect consumers and investors, the FSB said. It identified three  priority areas  for international collaboration on monitoring fintech: managing operational risks such as management failures; mitigating cyber risks; and monitoring risks to the financial system that could emerge as fintech activities increase. The report classifies fintech by activities and primary function, an essential first move before fashioning any new rules.  Regulators need to understand the impact that developments in fintech can have on financial stability, especially given the rapid rise of innovation in this space,  said Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada and chair of the FSB's fintech issues group.

In a report on fintech's financial stability implications, the FSB said that higher consumer expectations, evolving technology and changes in financial regulation and market structure had driven rapid growth in the fintech industry, leading some firms to develop without the necessary risk management expertise, while many may underestimate the level of risk they are taking on.  Regulators need to understand the impact that developments in fintech can have on financial stability, especially given the rapid rise of innovation in this space,  said Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada and chair of the FSB's fintech issues group. The FSB identified three priorities to improve international monitoring of the new breed of players that include retail payment systems, fintech credit, robo-advisers, blockchain-based wholesale payment systems, privately issued digital currencies and artificial intelligence. It called on authorities to manage operational risk form third-party service providers, mitigate cyber risks, and monitor macro-financial risks that could emerge as fintech activities continue to expand. The FSB also noted a dearth of data for monitoring the sector as many firms fall outside of the regulatory net. That has forced authorities to rely on consultant estimations in their regulatory responses to the growing sector. A stock-take of the regulatory approaches across 26 jurisdictions found that while 20 have taken some fintech-specific measures, only eight explicitly mention financial stability as part of policy considerations to-date, focusing instead on consumer protection and micro rather than macro-level regulation. Macro Threat Potential fintech benefits were identified, including decentralisation, increased intermediation by non-financial entities, efficiency, transparency and competition, but the sector was deemed vulnerable to a variety of financial and operational risks that could be amplified by fintech business models and pose a risk to the provision of critical financial services. For example, large and unexpected losses incurred on a single fintech lending platform could lead to contagion across the sector, the FSB warned. Many firms are also prone to pro-cyclicality as the presence of retail investors on lending platforms may exacerbate large sentiment swings, while social trading and robo-advice can lead to herding behaviour. The quest for speed and efficiency can also give rise to excess volatility. Algorithmic traders, for example can rapidly withdraw from the market during periods of stress when liquidity demands are high. Vulnerabilities The FSB raised concerns around the evolution of fintech business models if expansion continues at the current rate. The report highlighted a growing number of fintech lending platforms offering  sell-out  options that allow investors to exit investments prior to maturity for a fee. The FSB said such clauses could lead to maturity mismatches. The report said some fintech lending and crowdfunding platforms are able to borrow funds to finance temporary holdings of bonds or equities, while some are beginning to add leverage by using their own balance sheet to fund loans. Cyber risks were also singled out for concern given the increased susceptibility when more systems are connected.  Although many of these issues are not new, they may be accentuated given the speed of growth of fintech, new forms of interconnectedness and increased dependencies on third-party service providers,  said the report.  All of the issues identified are building blocks for ensuring a strong, sustainable and resilient financial system as innovations in financial services evolve and are adopted.

Vice President Mike Pence is expected to travel to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to join Senate Republicans for a policy lunch before hosting a key conservative senator for dinner. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will continue meeting on-the-fence senators facing questions from their governors and state Medicaid offices about the bill's cuts to the government insurance program for the poor and disabled, lawmakers said. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis on Monday prompted Senator Susan Collins, a key moderate vote, to say she could not support moving forward on the bill as it was written. At least four conservative Republicans - Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee - said their opposition remained unchanged after the CBO analysis. Further, Collins, Paul and Johnson, along with Senator Dean Heller, have all said they will oppose a procedural motion that would allow McConnell to move forward and bring the bill up for a vote. Heller, a moderate Republican up for re-election next year in Nevada, is already facing political fallout after a group started by former campaign aides to President Donald Trump and Pence promised to run ads against him. The overlapping concerns and competing interests of the lawmakers highlights the balancing act facing McConnell as he tries to unify his party and deliver a legislative win to the president. Trump - and most Republicans in Congress - were elected on campaign pledges to repeal and replace Obamacare, Democratic President Barack Obama's signature 2010 law that extended insurance coverage to some 20 million Americans. The pressure is on for them to deliver now that they control the White House, House of Representatives and Senate. McConnell's goal was to vote on the bill before the July 4 recess that starts at the end of this week. He can afford to lose just two Republican senators from their 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate to pass healthcare, with Pence casting the tie-breaking vote. Moderate senators are concerned about millions of people losing insurance. Conservative senators have said the Senate bill does not do enough to repeal Obamacare. The CBO is only able to assess the impact of legislation within a 10-year window, but it said insurance losses were expected to grow beyond 22 million due to deep cuts to Medicaid that are not scheduled to go into effect until 2025. The CBO estimated it would decrease the budget deficit by $321 billion between 2017 and 2026. If the Senate passes a bill, it will either have to be approved by the House, which passed its own version last month, or the two chambers would have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee. Otherwise, the House could pass a new version and bounce it back to the Senate.

Known as pyrosomes, they are tubular colonies of hundreds or thousands of tiny individual creatures called zooids, enmeshed together in a gelatinous tunic roughly the consistency of gummy bear candy.  No relation to jellyfish, they resemble bumpy, opaque pickles in the water, typically a few centimeters or inches long, though some grow 1 or 2 feet (30cm or 60cm) in length. They feed by filtering microscopic algae, or phytoplankton, as they float with the current, and are known to glow in the dark - a bioluminescent characteristic that gives the organism its scientific name -- Pyrosoma, Greek for  fire body.  Pyrosomes have rarely if ever been seen along the U.S. West Coast until 2012, when first spotted in California waters. Since then, they have gradually multiplied and spread north, before exploding in numbers this spring, according to scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Although harmless to humans, they have been especially troublesome to the commercial salmon catch in Oregon, with large globs of the rubbery critters clogging fishing gear by the thousands in recent months. Some have even washed ashore.  It gets to a point where they're so abundant, you can’t even fish out there, so you have to pick up your gear and move elsewhere,  Nancy Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Oregon Salmon Commission, said on Monday. A single five-minute trawl with a research net by scientists off the Columbia River in late May scooped up roughly 60,000 pyrosomes, NOAA reported.

Hilarie Sorensen/NOAA Fisheries/Handout via REUTERSFishermen were also hit in southeastern Alaska, where some crews suspended operations earlier this year when pyrosome densities were at their height, said Aaron Baldwin, a fishery biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.  There were clouds of them in the water,  he said. Karen Johnson, who fishes for halibut and tracks pyrosome reports on her Facebook page in Sitka, Alaska, said she has personally seen them glowing in a bucket of live specimens caught by her brother.

Hilarie Sorensen/NOAA Fisheries/Handout via REUTERS I stuck them in a dark room, and moved the water a little bit, and sure enough, they were bioluminescent,  she told Reuters. Scientists believe the pyrosome phenomenon is related to elevated sea temperatures along the Pacific Coast that have brought other changes to marine life during the past few years, including a surge in California sea lion strandings. More baffling is how far from the tropics pyrosomes have strayed.  Certainly being up in Alaska is way out of their range,  NOAA research biologist Ric Brodeur said. Still unclear is whether they will linger long enough to significantly upset the region's food web. Pyrosomes are extremely efficient filters of phytoplankton, the principal diet of tiny shrimp-like krill, which in turn are a staple for some species of fish, whales and even seabirds, according to biologists.  Organisms like pyrosomes typically reproduce quickly, though their numbers could crash again once conditions become less favorable, NOAA scientist Keith Sakuma said, adding,  We just don't know what the long-term implications area.

(Reuters) - At a glitzy weekend gathering of donors to the powerful Koch brothers' network, much of the talk was about the conservative political group's criticism of the healthcare bill moving through the U.S. Senate. That opposition suggests billionaires Charles and David Koch, powerful players in Republican politics, remain at odds at least on some key issues with President Donald Trump, whose campaign last year they refused to back. But beyond healthcare, the Kochs and their operatives have welcomed much of the fledgling administration's actions, including efforts to roll back federal regulations, the decision to pull out of the Paris global climate accord, a Veterans Administration reform bill and the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Koch officials say their network has better access to the Trump administration than they expected given past frictions, partly because former Koch operatives have been hired in key administration jobs. “Overall, we’ve made tremendous progress on the federal level that we haven’t been able to make in the last 10 years,” said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, a Koch-backed advocacy group. Vice President Mike Pence has played a key role, meeting privately with Charles Koch on Friday, as well as Marc Short, a former member of the Koch network who is now Trump's point man in Congress.  Charles Koch, addressing more than 400 supporters gathered at The Broadmoor luxury resort in Colorado for the event, touted the progress the organization is making, particularly since the 2016 election. “When I look at where we are — at the size and effectiveness of this network — I’m blown away,” he said. “I’m more optimistic now than ever.” The Koch brothers have been a force in American politics since the 1980s. Their influence has largely been powered by a fortune centered on Koch Industries, the second-largest privately held company in the United States with annual revenues of more than $115 billion from interests in energy, chemicals and other sectors.  Both Trump and the Koch network have incentives to build warmer ties. The Kochs could end up spending hundreds of millions to preserve the Republican majority in Congress during next year’s midterm elections. Attendees to the weekend meeting had to donate at least $100,000 to be invited. Koch-funded groups such as Freedom Partners could also help build support among conservative activists for tax reform and other Trump administration agenda items. Mutual Wariness During the 2016 campaign, the Kochs kept their distance from Trump. Charles Koch spoke out against Trump's proposed Muslim registry, invoking a comparison to Nazi Germany. The network did not actively work to defeat Trump during the Republican primary. But when he secured the nomination, the group did not spend money backing him or criticizing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. By contrast, the Koch network spent more than $120 million in the 2012 election to defeat President Barack Obama.     For his part, Trump lumped the Kochs in with other special-interest groups, boasting that he did not need their money and that they could not influence him.

Stephen Ford, a speechwriter for Pence, has worked for Freedom Partners.     Koch operatives were encouraged when the White House recently cooled to the idea of a tax on imports, the so-called “border adjustment tax” advocated by House Speaker Paul Ryan.     Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners mounted a media and public-pressure campaign against the border tax. Phillips has met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the issue. Mnuchin’s chief of staff, Eli Miller, served as the Ohio director of AFP.     Mnuchin has since come out against the tax in meetings with members of Congress, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina said at the donor retreat.     On the veterans bill, Koch group Concerned Veterans of America was able to work with one of their own. Darin Selnick, a former senior adviser to that group, is now a top aide to Trump’s Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin.     That group is working with the White House on the more than 130 federal judicial vacancies Trump must fill, partnering with conservative legal advocate Leonard Leo, who has become a trusted Trump adviser on the issue.     Leo joined Charles Koch on stage at a donor event on Saturday night. A Koch group,  Concerned Veterans of America, mounted a grassroots campaign to secure Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.     Yet some stark policy differences remain between the Kochs and the Trump administration.     The Kochs, who are proponents of criminal justice reform, are frustrated with the Department of Justice's effort to crack down on low-level drug offenders. They also disagree with Trump's hardline immigration stance.     Asked about the Koch network’s successes, a White House aide did not expressly address the network’s goals, but said Trump “has already made tremendous progress toward making our country prosperous and safe again.”     In interviews with attendees at the donor summit, opinions on Trump were mixed, but even some critics found reason to praise the administration. Several mentioned Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, an advocate of charter schools and vouchers.     Other attendees were effusive in their praise of Trump’s actions so far.     “He's walks the walk,” said Al Hartman, CEO of a property management firm in Houston. “He's doing exactly what everyone wants done.” Reporting By James Oliphant; Editing by Caren Bohan and Cynthia Osterman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-koch-idUSL1N1JN125"},

Official figures show that the royals received 42.8 million pounds ($54.5 million) in 2016-17 from the  Sovereign Grant , the government handout that covers the running costs of the queen's household and travel expenses.  That figure is set to rise to 76.1 million pounds after the government agreed an increase to pay for a 369-million-pound, 10-year refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, whose aging electrical wiring, water pipes and heating system are in urgent need of repair. Alan Reid, the queen's treasurer known as Keeper of the Privy Purse, said the cost of the monarchy to every Briton last year amounted to 65 pence - the cost of a first-class postage stamp.  When you consider that against what the queen does and represents for this country, I believe it represents excellent value for money,  Reid told reporters. The royal family carried out more than 3,000 official engagements last year, with the 91-year-old queen attending 162 and her husband Prince Philip performing 196, Reid said. Philip, 96, who needed hospital treatment for an infection last week, announced in May he would retire from public life later this year.   FILE PHOTO: Members of Britain's royal familly stand on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after Trooping the Colour in London, Britain, June 17, 2017.Toby MelvilleOpinion polls show the 91-year-old queen remains hugely popular with Britons and at least two-thirds indicate they want the monarchy, which traces its royal line back to a Norman invasion in 1066, to continue. Anti-monarchy republicans in Britain say the true annual cost of the royals to taxpayers is hundreds of millions of pounds because security expenditure is not included, while newspapers have often been critical of the amount spent on minor royals and travel expenses. The Sovereign Grant is calculated based on 15 percent of surplus revenue from the Crown Estate - a property portfolio belonging to the monarchy - two years previously and has grown rapidly since the system was introduced five years ago, with the royals receiving 31 million pounds in 2013.  The money covers staffing costs and upkeep of royal palaces like 1.2 million pounds spent on replacing the Orangery Doors at Windsor Castle that had become inoperable due to rot and decay. Last November, the government agreed to raise the grant to 25 percent of Crown Estate surplus to pay for the overhaul of Buckingham Palace while allowing it to remain occupied. The bill for travel in 2016-17 amounted to 4.5 million pounds, with heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles's visit to Italy, Romania and Austria at the end of March the most expensive at 154,000 pounds. Meanwhile the royal train, which was used about 14 times last year, cost some 900,000 pounds.

The regulations also criminalize any failure by government departments to carry out the plan. China has increasingly sought to fortify its cyberspace from both internal and external attacks, citing threats to its national infrastructure and political stability.

The plan requires provinces to upgrade networks and construct expert response teams as part of the centralized reporting system, said the Cyberspace Administration of China in a notice posted on its website.   The regulations also criminalize any failure by government departments to carry out the plan. China has increasingly sought to fortify its cyberspace from both internal and external attacks, citing threats to its national infrastructure and political stability. Last month, dozens of local authorities, including police and industry regulators, were hobbled by the WannaCry ransomware attack that infected more than 30,000 Chinese organizations and 300,000 worldwide in a matter of days. The national response plan includes a four-tier colour-coded warning system that ranks cyber attacks as either red, orange, yellow or blue depending on severity, with red signaling the highest level of alert. It also requires relevant departments to open international channels of communication during the sudden onset of international security threats. Cyber attacks in China spiked by over 950 percent between 2014 and 2016, according to a PwC survey, with  Internet of Things  (IoT) connected devices identified as a particular vulnerability. Last October, vulnerabilities in Chinese manufactured devices were partially blamed for a large-scale attack which temporarily crippled Twitter, Spotify, Netflix and other major websites.

A populist former martial arts star Khaltmaa Battulga of the opposition Democratic Party won the most votes in the Monday election, but failed to secure the majority required, the committee said. He will face ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP) candidate Miyeegombo Enkhbold, who came second, in a run-off on July 9, the committee's chairman, Choinzon Tsodnomtseren, told a news briefing. The election has been seen as a referendum on the government's economic recovery plans and China's role in the remote, resource-rich country known as the birthplace of Mongol emperor Genghis Khan. Battulga, who is regarded as a resource nationalist who is suspicious of Mongolia's giant neighbor to the south, had been confident about his chances.  I never lose, I must win. I always win in the history of my life,  Battulga told Reuters in an interview late on Monday, before the preliminary results were announced. After final tallies from districts came in overnight, Battulga emerged with 517,478 votes, 38.1 percent of the total, according to Mongolian state television. Enkhbold of the ruling MPP, regarded as pro-investment and market-friendly, scraped through to the second round with 411,748 votes, 30.3 percent of the total. Enkhbold, an establishment politician and the speaker of parliament, appears to have suffered as a result of his party's austerity policies. Presidential candidate Khaltmaa Battulga holds his ballot paper in a polling station in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, June 26, 2017.B. RentsendorjAusterity The government was forced to implement austerity measures to secure a $5.5 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in May. The administration raised interest rates and slashed public spending last year to try to cope with heavy debt and a precipitous fall in the value of Mongolia's currency, the tugrik. Slideshow (3 Images)Enkhbold, who was favorite in the run-up to the vote, was trailing in third place for much of the count after a stronger than expected performance by Sainkhuu Ganbaatar of the breakaway Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP).  Ganbaatar finished with 30.2 percent, trailing Enkhbold by fewer than 2,000 votes, and is eliminated from the contest. All three presidential candidates promised to fix economic problems but their campaigns were clouded by corruption allegations. Geert-Hinrich Ahrens, leading a delegation of election observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, expressed concern about electoral transparency. Though Ahrens said attempts to bribe voters were not witnessed,  the rumors were rather massive . Turnout was 68.27 percent, and included more than 18,000 ballots left blank by voters protesting against the choice of candidates. Mongolia is a parliamentary democracy. The government is run by a prime minister, but the president has powers to veto legislation and make judicial appointments.

The onshore spot yuan firmed to 6.8101 per dollar as of 4:30 pm (0830 GMT), gaining 0.46 percent from the previous late session, and strengthening from an open at 6.8387. The People's Bank of China takes the 0830 GMT level as its closing price, which is taken ito consideration along with the yuan's trade-weighted basket to determine the next day's midpoint fixing. On Tuesday, the PBOC set the midpoint rate at 6.8292 per dollar prior to market open, the weakest since May 31, softer than the previous fix 6.822.  Traders attributed the yuan's gains to dollar sales by major state-owned banks.  Big banks showed up in the past few days offering dollar liquidity as well, but the amount was much less than they sold today,  said a Shanghai-based trader at a Chinese bank. State-owned banks have sold dollars in the forex market regularly since late last year in what traders believe is part of official efforts to prevent the yuan from weakening too fast. Gains in the onshore spot yuan also lifted its offshore counterpart to 6.8105 per dollar by 4:30 pm (0830 GMT), 0.7 percent firmer than the previous close. Another Shanghai-based trader suspected that the Chinese authorities wanted to stabilise the yuan ahead of President Xi Jinping's visit to Hong Kong from June 29 to July 1 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the city's handover from British colonial rule. On Tuesday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reiterated at the World Economic Forum (WEF) that no restriction would be implemented on foreign firms' repatriating profits from China. Capital outflows were a big concern for the government last year as it attempted to put the economy back on track and keep the yuan stable without exhausting its foreign exchange reserves. Outflows have eased, and foreign-exchange reserves have expanded the past four months.  The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index, which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, stood at 94.19, firmer than the previous day's 93.91.  The global dollar index fell to 97.025 from the previous close of 97.426.  Offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts (NDFs), considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations of the yuan's value, traded at 6.9795, 2.15 percent weaker than the midpoint.

When the 46-year-old pulls the container back up, she finds it filled with undrinkable muddy water. Water levels in the well are dwindling fast and not being replenished, she says. Nhari lives in Westlea, a middle-class suburb of the Zimbabwean capital and an area built on wetlands. Like many residents, she has no piped water and relies on the well, which has become more erratic in the face of longer drought. “Since 2015, our wells here started having problems in storing groundwater for longer periods as they began to dry up quickly,” she said.    Residents like Nhari, and a growing number of newcomers to Harare, find themselves in a bind. They need somewhere to live, and developers are all too ready to sell them land in wetland areas. But as construction covers more wetlands, water sources are drying up. Wetlands - which include bogs and swamps - are essential to the well-being of the city, environmentalists say.  They can ease the impacts of a changing climate by helping maintain ground water levels, and protect areas from the worst impacts of floods by absorbing excess water. By law, anyone intending to build on a wetland must apply for a permit from the government's Environmental Management Agency (EMA).  In January, EMA threatened to evict wetland residents in Masvingo, one of the country’s oldest towns, saying their homes had been built without government approval. But in Westlea, Nhari is skeptical about the likelihood of enforcement. “I have lived here for close to 10 years and have not seen any resident being questioned for building on this so-called wetland,” she said. She added that she doesn't know how wetlands function and why they are important.    According to EMA spokesman Steady Kangata, 27 wetland areas in Harare and Chitungwiza, a town 25 km (15 miles) from the Zimbabwean capital, have been partially built on. In Chitungwiza, 14 out of 15 wetlands have been built on, and 13 of Harare's 29 wetlands have been taken over for construction, Kangata told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Approximately 60 percent of Harare and Chitungwiza’s wetlands have been invaded or taken over for construction purposes. All these constructions on wetlands are unlawful,” Kangata said.   The Westlea wetland is an area of 123 hectares (304 acres). It has 87 houses, the first of which was built in 2008, according to the Harare Residents Trust, a nongovernmental organization. Nhari moved into her home in 2009 with her husband, after he bought a 600-square-metre plot from a private landowner. She says she has a deed of sale to prove it – but what she doesn’t have is water. Environmental experts say residents like Nhari are the source of their own problems. “A wetland acts like a sponge which absorbs water and then recharges underground water so that the water table remains high. Construction disrupts this process,” said Sandra Gobvu of Environment Africa, a nongovernmental organization that works in southern Africa to promote sustainable development. When wetland areas are concreted over, much less water is absorbed, Gobvu added. Wetlands also help control flooding by absorbing excess water and releasing it gradually into water bodies, she said. “If we preserved them in their natural state, wetlands would actually help us adapt to the changing climatic conditions,” said Barnabas Mawire, Environment Africa's Zimbabwe country director. He believes that while Zimbabwe’s widespread water problems are due to a number of factors, wetland destruction plays a role.  “Climate change will make future efforts to restore or rehabilitate wetlands more difficult, especially if we continue to destroy them at this rate,” said Mawire.     Environmental activists in Zimbabwe say they are struggling to keep up with the rate of wetlands encroachment. “It is hard to measure the proportion of construction work occurring on wetlands here because daily we wake up to new building activities emerging around many wetlands,” said Liberty Chiura, a member of the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association. Meanwhile, landowners say they are not acting illegally by selling wetlands plots. “We don’t just wake up and start pegging land at wetlands for people without binding permits from local authorities,” said Elton Javangwe, a private landowner based in Harare. “This is part of a farm I bought and later decided to subdivide before selling housing stands, after local authorities and EMA regularized it,” Javangwe said. Mawire said that some construction on wetlands is authorized. “Developers know they have to apply to the Environmental Management Authority for permits to build, and they do get these permits at times,  he said.    However, there are many other people who invade pieces of land without any knowledge that there are wetlands and start construction. And there are others who know, but deliberately ignore what the law says and go on to build,” Mawire added.     He said that as people migrate from the countryside and demand for land in urban areas increases, new residents are unlikely to be aware of the risks of building on wetlands, to themselves and the broader community. “The developer might know, but sadly for many people they only realize the consequences once they finish building and start experiencing floods, cracks and collapse of infrastructure,” said Mawire. Failure to abide by Zimbabwe’s laws governing wetlands can result in a fine of up to $500, imprisonment of up to two years, or both.

The Los Angeles Angels right-hander had lost seven consecutive starts, tying the franchise record. His team had lost the last 10 games he started, and he had allowed an American League-high 23 home runs. He was facing a Los Angeles Dodgers team that had won 10 straight games and was on a home run spree, having homered in 17 straight games and belting 41 total in that span. But baseball is nothing if not unpredictable. Nolasco threw 6 1/3 shutout innings and allowed just five hits in a 4-0 Angels win that snapped all of those streaks and added to his team's own momentum. The Angels (41-39) have won three straight, five of seven on their current road trip, and they moved two games over .500 for the first time since May 23. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at DodgersLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch It's been a long streak, but I felt good after a lot of those losses and just wanted the positive feelings to carry over,  Nolasco said.  They're the hottest team in baseball, and I just wanted to make good pitches.  Nolasco (3-9) gave up a leadoff double to Chase Utley and two walks to load the bases in the first inning, but he struck out Joc Pederson to end the threat. The Dodgers didn't mount another threat until the seventh, when they collected a pair of hits on balls that deflected off Nolasco to put runners in scoring position with one out. Manager Mike Scioscia went to reliever Cam Bedrosian after the second of those caroms. Bedrosian struck out pinch hitter Mike Freeman and Utley to end the threat.  Those were probably the two biggest outs of the game,  Scioscia said.  We know Ricky is a better pitcher than the numbers show. He pitched tonight the way we need him to pitch. He didn't give in to Pederson in the first.  Nolasco had been the victim of poor run support in many of his losses. The Angels scored 26 runs in the 15 previous starts while Nolasco was still in the game.  I try to stay mentally the same regardless of the situation,  Nolasco said.  It was great to get some runs early so I could pitch ahead.  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said,  Of course, the guy who has allowed the most home runs is the guy who snaps the streak. He was spinning the ball better than I had seen this season.  We lost a ballgame. The fact (Rich) Hill pitched seven innings is the good thing to come out of it.  The Dodgers left-hander had not pitched more than five innings in any of his nine starts before Monday, when he went seven innings and allowed just four hits, only one of them well struck. Hill retired 12 of the last 13 hitters he faced. He gave up three runs while walking two and striking out seven. The Angels produced two runs in the third on a walk to Nolasco, a double steal and two scratch hits. Yunel Escobar's two-run single opened the scoring. Andrelton Simmons tripled and scored in the fourth to make it 3-0. Martin Maldonado hit his eighth home run of the season in the ninth off Sergio Romo. The Dodgers (51-27) had scored five runs or more in eight of the 10 wins during their streak, and they had won 16 of 17 and 11 straight home games. NOTES: Dodgers RHP Brandon McCarthy was placed on the 10-day disabled list with right knee inflammation, a day after lasting just three innings and throwing three wild pitches against the Colorado Rockies. ... The Dodgers recalled RHP Brock Stewart and OF Trayce Thompson from Triple-A Oklahoma City and sent down RHP Ross Stripling. ... The Angels recalled 1B/3B Jefry Marte from Triple-A Salt Lake and sent 3B Kaleb Cowart back to the minors. Cowart went 2-for-3 with two RBIs in Sunday against Boston in his major league season debut.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-dodgers-writethru-idUSMTZED6R6XZWZU"},

Speaking at the ECB's annual policy forum at Sintra in Portugal, Draghi highlighted a recovering euro zone economy and said that deflationary forces had been replaced with inflationary ones, but added that stimulus in the form of the ECB's monetary support was still needed. That sounded to investors, however, like he was ready to give more ground on German demands that the ECB get on with starting to reduce the volume of extra euros it is feeding monthly into the economy. The euro surged as Draghi spoke, rising as much as half a percent on the day to $1.1255, its highest level since Jun. 14. It had earlier traded around the $1.1187 mark.  Draghi's comments I would say were quite optimistic on the growth outlook, talking about a broadening recovery and even saying growth was above trend,  said Niels Christensen, currency strategist with Nordea bank in Copenhagen.  While talking about inflation he said mainly temporary factors were slowing inflation at the moment, so he's not too concerned about the fallback in at least headline inflation.  Draghi's comments contrasted with a dovish tone he took on Monday, saying that super low interest rates create jobs, foster growth and benefit borrowers, while rejecting calls to exit super easy monetary policy quickly. The single currency's strength pulled the dollar index - which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies - to an eight-day low of 96.973. The greenback was also 0.3 percent lower against the Japanese currency at 111.560 yen, having earlier risen to a near five-week high of 112.075 in Asian trading. Investors were awaiting speeches by Federal Reserve officials for signs on whether the central bank will stick to its guns and raise rates this year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen addresses the British Academy in London at 1700 GMT, less than two hours after an address by Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in the same city at 1515 GMT. Fed officials have signalled they will look through a slowdown in inflation and continue on their current trajectory of interest rate hikes - though investors are sceptical and market pricing shows only a 40 percent chance of a rise at the Fed's December meeting. A positive view from Yellen despite a recent batch of weak U.S. economic data would support the Fed's forecast for another rise in policy rates this year.  A notion increasingly shared in the market ... is that the Fed is continuing to normalize monetary policy regardless of more muted inflation developments - this is the message which has been provided during the last week by several Fed speakers,  said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist with Credit Agricole in London.  This suggests that the market-based rate expectations have additional room of adjusting to the upside should this notion become even a bigger one.  Sterling was up 0.2 percent at $1.2748 ahead of the release of the Bank of England's Financial Stability Report and a speech by BoE governor Mark Carney. The pound see-sawed last week after Carney and the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane gave opposing commentary on their stance towards raising record low UK interest rates, compounding a split at the Bank's rate-setting committee.

Merkel said at an event hosted by women's magazine  Brigitte  on Monday evening she had taken note of other German parties favouring same-sex marriage.  I would like to lead the discussion more into a situation where it is a question of conscience rather than something I push through with a majority vote,  she said, when asked about her position. The Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in Merkel's right-left  grand coalition , the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens - all potential coalition partners after the election - have made gay marriage a condition for a tie-up. Responding to the announcement, SPD leader Martin Schulz said on Tuesday his party would even push for a vote in parliament this week. With broad support among Germans for gay marriage, the law would likely get easy approval in the lower house if conservatives could vote according to their conscience and not face a party whip. Polls put Merkel's conservatives 10-15 points ahead of the SPD, but short of a parliamentary majority. Fearful of antagonising some in her traditionally Catholic conservative parliamentary bloc who oppose it, Merkel has previously argued against same-sex marriage. Same-sex civil partnerships have been allowed in Germany since 2001 but marriage is a step up from that. The LSVD association representing homosexuals welcomed what they said was a belated shift, saying it was a face-saving measure to exit a dead end. They called for a vote in the Bundestag lower house before the election.  After 15 years of an ideological blockade .. social pressure and the commitments of other parties have made an impact,  said LSVD spokesman Axel Hochrein.  Equal rights for all people is part of our constitution,  he added. Writing by Madeline Chambers, editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/germany-gaymarriage-idUSL8N1JO1ML"},

Gains were capped however as investors waited to see if U.S. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen would restate the case for a third 2017 interest rate rise when she speaks in London later. Weak U.S. durable goods orders have raised concerns about tepid growth and slowing inflation, pushing long-dated U.S. Treasury yields to seven-month lows on Monday. The dollar retreated 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies. MSCI's benchmark emerging stocks index was steady, with a weak opening in emerging Europe offsetting a stronger performance in Asia. Index heavyweight South Korea hit a record high, buoyed by expectations of a strong second quarter. Chinese mainland stocks also rose 0.2 percent to an 18-month high after industrial profits surged 16.7 percent in May year-on-year.  China was important but oil has stabilised and that is tempting people to get back into the EM trade,  said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB.  The mood has changed a little bit, and to a large extent it is driven by commodities and oil in particular.  Oil prices rose 1.2 percent to trade above $46 a barrel, after recent falls. The Kazakh tenge was one of the main beneficiaries of the rebound, firming 0.7 percent against the dollar. The weaker dollar also allowed the South African rand and the Turkish lira to make modest gains, firming around 0.1-0.2 percent. The rand has steadied after volatile trading last week. Markets were rattled by a call from an anti-graft watchdog for South Africa's central bank to change its mandate, accusing it of pursuing commercial interests. Investors' nerves were already frayed over revisions to the country's mining charter. Hammarlund said he expected more populist initiatives in the run up to the ruling African National Congress' party conference in December.  That's a big political risk for the rand,  he said. The Russian rouble remained on the backfoot, slipping 0.2 percent, and shares in Russian business conglomerate Sistema slumped as much as 17 percent in early trade after a Russian court  arrested  some of its assets as part of a legal dispute with Rosneft. The diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its Arab neighbours rumbled on, with Bahrain accusing Qatar of military escalation while Germany labelled a 13-point ultimatum issued to Qatar  very provocative . Overnight Brazil's top federal prosecutor charged President Michel Temer with taking multi-million dollar bribes but the real was steady in early trade.  It's mostly priced in already, but the fact that he will likely survive this is negative for the real,  said Hammarlund.

Passage of the bill fulfils a campaign promise of President Tsai Ing-wen and is projected to delay the possibility of a default in payments to retirees by a decade. Instead of 18 percent, pensions will receive nine percent from July 2018 until the end of 2020, and then be reduced to zero starting in 2021. The legislation also raises the retirement eligibility age to 65 starting in 2026, eliminating current options for civil servants to take earlier retirement. The bill only covers civil servants. Additional legislation reforming the pension system for teachers and the military will be reviewed later.  This is a very important step for Taiwan's (pension) reform process,  said Wang Min-sheng, a spokesman for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.  Its intent is to allow the government to take care of every generation, while allowing retirees to have a high level of security and quality of life in their retirement.  But the plan has angered public servants, many of whom say it will ruin their retirement plans. Thousands of military personnel, teachers, police and civil servants have protested against the plan several times. Pension reform is critical for Taiwan as large payouts are no longer sustainable for the export-reliant economy, with contributions crimped by slower economic growth and a rapidly aging population. Pensions for civil servants could default by 2030, teachers by 2031, and other workers by 2048, government data shows, if the system is not reformed.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.8 percent, as were blue chips, while Germany's DAX was 0.8 percent weaker.

Schaeffler's profit warning will reignite the debate on the resilience on supplier margins and organic growth (post pricing) as we approach the 'peak' of the cycle,  Jefferies analysts added. German drugmaker Stada was another notable faller, dropping 5 percent after private equity groups Bain Capital and Cinven failed to win the required shareholder acceptances to take over the firm. Stada's shares have rallied nearly 26 percent this year, boosted by buyout talks. Spanish banks were a bright spot as investors cheered Bankia's move to buy smaller peer BMN in a deal worth around $924 million, a further step in cleaning up Spain's beleaguered banking sector. Bankia's shares rose more than 3 percent. They helped support Europe's banking index which was flat after gains on Monday sparked by a taxpayer-funded rescue of two struggling Italian regional banks, which prompted a rally in Italian banking stocks.  Spain is still seen as the weak one in Europe, so if this takes it a step away from further weakness then that's certainly a positive,  Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.  It's probably a positive in the sense that it's consolidation, cleaning it up, simplifying it, but it relies on how futures moves are made.  Gains among mining firms Anglo American, ArcelorMittal and Rio Tinto helped prop up the basic resources sector, which gained 1.1 percent, the only sector to make any headway. Britain's commodities-heavy FTSE 100 <.FTSE. index was down 0.4 percent.

Fed officials have signalled they will look through a slowdown in inflation and continue on their current trajectory of interest rate hikes. But investors are sceptical and market pricing shows only a 40 percent chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting.     Yellen is scheduled to take part in a discussion on global economic issues at London's British Academy. Ahead of that, the dollar        slipped 0.5 percent against major currencies.             She will likely reiterate the central bank's positive views about the U.S. economy and the Fed's stance of raising interest rates once more this year, said OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan.      Spot gold        had risen 0.6 percent to $1,251.84 per ounce at 0844 GMT. It dropped to $1,236.46 on Monday, its weakest since May 17.     The precious metal slid 1 percent in the previous session as a large sell order hit sentiment, though losses were limited by political uncertainty around the world.                  U.S. gold futures         for August delivery rose 0.5 percent to $1,252.20 an ounce.              Around the time London came in there was some decent buying seen through COMEX. The market consequently sharply rose through $1,247 all the way to $1,252 in a matter of seconds, as stops were tripped,  MKS PAMP trader Alex Thorndike said in a note.         We are still keeping an eye out on geopolitical tensions, gold thrives in uncertainty and increased uncertainty in the near term should actually push gold prices up,  said OCBC's Gan.     Allegations of ties to Russia have cast a shadow over U.S. President Donald Trump's first five months in office, while the British government's looming Brexit talks are also fueling concern about global stability.     Tensions also rose as the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a victory to Trump by reviving parts of a travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries.                    Spot gold may drop back toward $1,172 in three months, as suggested by its wave pattern and a Fibonacci retracement analysis, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.                  Among other precious metals, silver        rose 0.8 percent to $16.68 an ounce. Palladium        climbed 0.4 percent to $868.25 per ounce.      Platinum        rose 1.1 percent to $922.90 per ounce, recovering from Monday's six-week trough.

The defection by several Monetary Policy Committee officials to the camp supporting a rise in base interest rates has given the pound, battered by another round of political uncertainty after this month's elections, some support in the past week. On the one hand, reinstating the 0.5 percent of risk-weighted assets banks are asked to hold as a buffer against shocks to consumer finances would be a sign of confidence in an economy which has looked to be slowing. But it might also take any unwanted steam out of loan growth which could be cited as one reason for raising rates. Sterling inched 0.2 percent higher to $1.2742 in morning trade in London, but was 0.4 percent weaker against a euro boosted by comments from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi.  The reaction probably depends to a large degree on what (BoE Governor Mark) Carney says,  said Derek Halpenny, a strategist with MUFG in London.  You could on one side argue that on one side that raising the counter-cyclical buffer heads off a rate rise and is sterling negative. On the other hand it does show some faith in growth. My feeling is reaction may be minimal.  Halpenny has been one of the bank analysts calling for a rise in sterling in recent months, judging the worst of the pound's Brexit-led sell-off is now in the price. But he also says the uncertainty generated by Prime Minister Theresa May's loss of her parliamentary majority in elections on June 8 has made it harder for sterling to rise in the near term. May has sealed the deal she needs to approve a stripped-down legislative programme, but many political commentators still expect another election to be called in the next year under a new Conservative leader.

Shares in the majority state-owned lender opened 8 percent higher on its return to the main Irish stock exchange on Tuesday after the government sold a quarter of the bank it nationalised almost a decade ago in a 3 billion euro ($3.4 billion) listing. Ireland's finance minister said following the sale that he could review a pledge to sell a maximum of 25 percent in any of its bank shareholdings by the end of 2018 after AIB hit that limit.  The opportunity is now stronger. It's like all these things, never miss an opportunity if it's there, at the moment the one thing the government do know is there is demand,  AIB CEO Bernard Byrne told Reuters in a telephone interview.  Ultimately it's their decision but the one thing that has become more obvious is there is lots of demand right now and the Irish story works right now. Those things don't always exists so if you wait for the perfect time, the market may not be there. The market is there right now.  Byrne said investors liked the bank's business model, Ireland's fast growing economy and the fact that AIB would have excess capital available over the next two or three years. Shares in the third largest European bank IPO since the financial crisis were over four times oversubscribed when they were sold last week. They were trading at 4.73 euros by 0815 GMT, 7.5 percent above the listing price of 4.40 euros. The size of the IPO is set to rise to 28.75 percent after the government included a greenshoe, or over-allotment, option. The limit on share sales allowed for such an option to nudge it slightly above 25 percent. The IPO was dominated by institutions happy to take a long-term view of the bank which Byrne said meant the shareholder base was broadly dispersed with very few of sufficient scale that they would have to declare the size of their shareholding.  A lot of large funds have a good position, not a concentrated position. They have further to go,  he said. He said shareholders had to form their own view on how much capital could be returned to them but added that the bank, which is generating capital each year, plans to return its core tier one capital ratio to 13 percent from the current level of 16 percent once it normalises its stock of non-performing loans. The Irish government plans to use the proceeds to cut some 1.5 percent from a national debt that at 200 billion euros is still among the highest in the euro zone by most measures.

The FTSE 100 was down 0.4 percent by 0820 GMT, erasing all the previous session's gains, with the top weights GKN, Marks & Spencer and TUI. A profit warning by German's Schaeffler, which sent its shares spiralling down 12 percent, also weighed on British car parts supplier GKN, as carmakers across Europe slid 1.5 percent.  While we were braced for GKN to have a tougher second quarter after a strong first quarter, we suspect Schaeffler's mention of pricing pressure will still send a shiver down the spine of most observers,  say Jefferies analysts. They added, however, that they hesitated to make a direct read-across to GKN. Travel and leisure stocks were among the worst performers, with tour operator TUI down 2.3 percent after Barclays cut its target price on the stock. A downgrade to sell from Investec weighed on gambling company William Hill on the mid-caps as well. Strength among miners lent the FTSE a helping hand, pushing it slightly ahead of European peers. Anglo American, Rio Tinto, Antofagasta , BHP Billiton and Glencore were the top gainers. Updates from small-caps Debenhams and Carpetright provided further pieces of the puzzle as investors continued to seek clarity on the resilience of the UK consumer.  Both Debenhams and Carpetright are heavily dependent on the health of the UK consumer,  said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald.  With wage growth softening at the same time as inflation is beating expectations, there is a real wage growth squeeze on individuals.   Additionally, savings levels are low which means consumers have less slack to bear these reductions in purchasing power,  he added. Against this tense backdrop, there was relief as a positive trading update from Carpetright sent the carpet provider's shares up 11 percent. It had suffered a sharp fall in late April after nudging its profit forecast down, indicating consumers were cutting back on spending on larger-ticket items related to home renovation. Its shares were on track for their best day in five months, but their value had still eroded 25 percent from their levels prior to the forecast trimming. Debenhams however fell 3.4 percent to an eight-year low after it flagged a more volatile trading environment and said sales slid. Its 2017 profit could land towards the lower end of expectations if conditions did not improve, Chief Executive Sergio Bucher said.  Debenhams is particularly at risk from a slowing UK macro environment given its low margins,  say Jefferies analysts. Marks & Spencer, which sells clothes and home items alongside food, fell 1.9 percent, weighed down by Debenhams.

After the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score, Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, said she could not support moving forward on the bill as written. Collins' opposition highlights the delicate balance that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must strike as he tries to deliver a legislative win to President Donald Trump by reconciling the Republican Party's moderate and conservative wings. Moderate senators are concerned about millions of people losing insurance. Key conservative senators have said the Senate bill does not do enough to repeal Obamacare. The CBO assessment that an additional 15 million people would be uninsured in 2018 under the bill and its prediction that insurance premiums would skyrocket over the first two years prompted concern from both sides.  McConnell's goal was to have a vote on the bill before the July 4 recess that starts at the end of this week. But several Republicans, including Collins, have said they would not approve a procedural motion that would clear the way for a vote. McConnell can afford to lose just two Republican senators from their 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate, which would allow passage of the bill with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote.    If you are on the fence ... this CBO score didn't help you, so I think it's going to be harder to get to 50, not easier,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said of the bill's prospects. The CBO score is also likely to amplify criticism from industry groups such as the American Medical Association, which said earlier on Monday that the Senate's bill violated the doctors' precept of  first, do no harm.  The CBO is only able to assess the impact of legislation within a 10-year window, but it said that insurance losses are expected to grow beyond 22 million due to deep cuts to the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled that are not scheduled to go into effect until 2025.  Trump and Republicans in Congress made repealing and replacing Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic legislation, a central campaign promise. The pressure is on for them to deliver now that they control the White House, House of Representatives and Senate. Republicans view Obamacare as costly government intrusion and say that individual insurance markets are collapsing. Obamacare expanded health coverage to some 20 million Americans by expanding Medicaid and mandating that individuals obtain health insurance. The CBO score was released just hours after Republicans revised the bill, adding a measure that would penalize people who let their insurance coverage lapse for an extended period. The move followed criticism that the original bill would result in a sicker - and more expensive - insurance pool.  White House Role At least four conservative Republicans - Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee - have expressed opposition to the Senate legislation.    Moderate Republicans have warned against replacing Obamacare with legislation that is too similar to the version passed by the House, saying it would cause too many people, especially those with low incomes, to lose health coverage. The CBO estimated that the House bill would cause 23 million people to lose insurance. Trump had called the House bill  mean  and asked Senate Republicans to come up with  more generous  legislation. Democrats uniformly oppose both the House and Senate versions of the bill.  CBO's report today makes clear that this bill is every bit as 'mean as the House bill,  Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters. FILE PHOTO: An electronic patients chart is shown on the wall to a hospital room at the newly constructed Kaiser Permanente San Diego Medical Center hospital in San Diego, California April 17, 2017.Mike BlakeThe White House in a statement on Monday criticized the CBO for issuing a  flawed report  and said its assessments should not be  trusted blindly.  Trump and McConnell have been working to shore up support. The president called key conservative senators over the weekend, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.  Both Cruz and Johnson said they were concerned about CBO estimates that insurance premiums would initially rise as much as 30 percent over the first two years before declining.  Doesn't help the people whose premiums skyrocket next year,  Cruz told reporters.  Kind of a problem, isn't it?  Johnson said of the short-term premium increase. Johnson and Paul have said they will oppose the procedural motion that would allow the Senate to move forward to a vote. Cruz is drafting suggested fixes. Paul remains opposed to the bill.     The first moderate Republican to oppose the bill, Senator Dean Heller, is already facing political fallout. America First Policies, a political group run by former Trump campaign staffers, said it would air healthcare-related attack ads against Heller, who faces a competitive re-election race in Nevada next year. Senator Rob Portman, of Ohio, who has not said whether he supports the bill, was  dressed down  by McConnell during a Monday leadership meeting, a senior Republican aide told Reuters.  Ohio participates in Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, and Republican Governor John Kasich has criticized the Senate bill. Portman's office did not respond to a request to comment. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said his governor, fellow Republican Rick Scott, would be on Capitol Hill this week to discuss the bill's impact on the state. Constituent and industry groups have been critical of the Senate bill's proposal to reduce the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and point to the CBO analysis that it would disproportionately affect older adults. Legislative Tweak Under Senate rules, the bill must replicate savings projected in the House version that passed last month. It cleared that critical hurdle, with the CBO estimating it would decrease the budget deficit by $321 billion over 2017-2026. A revision to the bill that imposes a penalty for prolonged lapses in insurance coverage addresses the original bill's provision to drop the Obamacare penalty on those who do not have insurance. Experts had warned that canceling the fine could lead to a sicker insurance pool because young and healthy people would not face consequences for failing to purchase insurance.  The bill would impose a six-month waiting period for anyone who lets their health insurance lapse for over 63 days and then wants to re-enroll in a plan in the individual market. The 15 million people the CBO estimates would be uninsured in 2018 is largely due to the repeal of the penalty associated with being uninsured. The CBO did not evaluate the revised version that included the new waiting period. Insurer Blue Cross and Blue Shield said it was encouraged by the inclusion of incentives for continuous coverage. Molina Healthcare said it preferred the Obamacare mandate, said that and the Senate bill, even after revised, would simply delay care. If the Senate passes a bill, it will either have to be approved by the House, the two chambers would have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee, or the House could pass a new version and bounce it back to the Senate.

(ICICI) and Axis Bank Ltd. (Axis) have been affirmed at 'BBB-'. The Outlook on the IDRs is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. While BoI's IDR was affirmed, its Viability Rating (VR) has been downgraded to 'b+' from 'bb-', to reflect its weaker intrinsic risk profile compared with higher-rated peers. The bank's core capital buffer has dropped significantly due to persistent losses and it appears vulnerable to moderate shocks. Fitch is maintaining the negative sector outlook on Indian banks. This is based on our assessment that the sector's core capitalisation, which has been eroded in the last few years, will remain challenged unless it is boosted by adequate capital support from the authorities or equity raising from capital markets. In addition, Basel III capital migration is entering its final phase with capital requirements at their most onerous. Internal capital generation is expected to remain weak due to the banks' subdued growth outlook while there could be significant pressure stemming from continued provisioning due to ageing of outstanding non-performing loans (NPLs) and the potential resolution of some large NPLs. Loan growth at around 5% in the financial year ended March 2017 (FY17) was the lowest in many decades. While the banking sector's stressed-assets ratio rose as expected (FY17: 12.3%; FY16: 11.5%), new NPL additions moderated compared with FY16, a trend which was observed across most public-sector banks. Asset quality at large private banks also deteriorated, albeit from a relatively lower base. Fitch believes that asset quality could witness some further downside risks due to emerging concerns in the power and farm sectors although slippages are not likely to be as large as in previous years. Nonetheless, high credit costs will remain a challenge for the sector's earnings although some banks, private or public, may witness gradual improvement in return on assets (ROA) going forward. Banks with higher provision cover and relatively better capitalisation will be in a position to resume growth faster than banks which are constrained due to either weak fundamentals or regulatory restrictions such as prompt corrective action. Resolving both the asset quality and capital questions are important conditions for reviving the financial health of the sector. Recent capital raising activity by a few large public-sector banks is a positive, but for most of these banks' capital buffers have already been impacted due to losses and weak internal capital generation. We expect the estimated capital requirement for the sector to drop from our previous forecast of USD90 billion primarily due to lower expectations on loan growth. However, the government has only committed to inject USD3 billion of capital in public-sector banks by FY19, which appears insufficient to materially improve buffers against the risk of further potential losses from existing and new NPLs. The recent talks on consolidating public-sector banks may further threaten capital levels if a merger is not accompanied by adequate capital support from the authorities. Their VRs are vulnerable and there is a high risk that mergers could leave the resulting entity in a much weaker position. Stable liquidity is a strength for Indian banks, which has held up well despite the deterioration in their intrinsic credit profile. The surge in low-cost deposits for public-sector banks post demonetisation reflects the high depositor confidence that they enjoy due to government ownership. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS (SRs) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS (SRFs) The Long-Term IDRs of SBI, BoB, PNB, Canara, BoI and ICICI are driven by their SRs of '2' and SRFs of 'BBB-'. The SRs and SRFs reflect Fitch's expectation that they are highly likely to receive extraordinary support from the Indian government due to their high systemic importance and the government's majority ownership in all except ICICI Bank. The VRs of SBI and ICICI are at the same level as their IDRs and therefore, also act as drivers for their long-term ratings. Axis's IDR is driven by its VR of 'bbb-'. Its SRF and SR are lower at 'BB+' and '3', respectively, mainly due to its moderate systemic importance and private ownership. BoB NZ is a fully owned subsidiary of BoB and its IDR is driven by a high probability of support from its parent due to the strong integration between the two entities and BoB NZ's small size relative to the parent, which makes any potential support required manageable for the parent. The Stable Outlook on the IDRs of SBI, BoB, PNB, Canara, BoI and ICICI mirrors the Outlook on India's rating (BBB-/Stable). For SBI, ICICI and Axis, it also reflects a degree of stability in their standalone credit profiles, which are also drivers for their IDRs. VIABILITY RATING State Bank of India (SBI) SBI's VR of 'bbb-' is the highest among public-sector banks. It reflects the bank's superior asset and deposit franchise as India's largest bank and its diversified business and earnings, which were further bolstered with SBI's recent merger with its five associate banks in April 2017. SBI's reputation as a flight-to-safety bank underpins its robust deposit franchise, which is due to its very strong government links. This translates into both high depositor confidence and a consistently large share of government business. The rating also reflects the bank's superior capital flexibility in addition to capital support, which has been periodically forthcoming from the authorities. The bank's recent equity issuance of around USD2.3 billion in June 2017 (6.7% of FY17 consolidated equity) was the largest done by a bank in India. SBI's core capitalisation at FYE17 (CET1 ratio: 9.8% standalone; 9.9% consolidated) is higher than that of other state-owned banks despite the bank posting a small loss at the consolidated level in FY17. We estimate that the consolidated bank's Fitch core capital ratio would be higher by around 80bp if the additional capital is factored in. NPL ratio at the standalone entity was relatively stable (FY17: 6.9%) but the sharp jump at the consolidated level (FY17: 9%; FY16: 6.4%) was mainly due to the aggressive clean-up at the associate banks prior to the merger. As a result, while the standalone SBI reported an ROA of around 0.4% in FY17, at the consolidated level, it was a negative 0.01%. This was, however, accompanied by an improvement in specific loan loss cover at both levels. Bank of Baroda BoB's VR of 'bb+' reflects its better intrinsic financial profile than most of the other state banks due to its lower share of vulnerable loans and significantly better provision cover than its peers. This makes the bank's core capitalisation less vulnerable to new loan losses. The VR also factors in the bank's strong funding franchise and its pan-India reach as India's second-largest public-sector bank. The bank's core capitalisation is better than most public-sector banks despite a 130bp drop in CET1 ratio to around 9%, mainly due to a technical de-recognition of certain deferred tax assets, which offset the impact of both positive earnings and improving risk density. The bank also has better capital flexibility, given its higher equity valuation, and there is a possibility that fresh capital may be raised in the near term. Punjab National Bank (PNB) PNB's VR of 'bb' captures its relatively stable asset quality in FY17 coupled with a steady but improving specific provision cover ratio of around 41%. The bank's core capital ratios appear weak (CET1: 7.9% at FY17), which means that a fresh capital injection will be required to meaningfully improve buffers. Periodic capital support from the authorities has been inadequate to maintain these buffers, although a declining risk density has helped ratios. Absolute NPLs declined on the back of improved recoveries and higher write-offs, which more than offset incremental slippages. The gross NPL ratio fell marginally to 12.5% in FY17 as a result. Efforts to reposition the loan book and a continued strong focus on bad loan recovery should limit the potential of a further marked deterioration in its asset quality. The rating also captures PNB's stable funding profile, which is backed by a relatively robust customer-deposit franchise given its presence in the deposit-rich parts of the country. PNB is among the top three public-sector banks and enjoys a pan-India reach. Canara Bank (Canara) Canara's VR of 'bb' reflects its gradually stabilising asset quality that is partly offset by capital ratios which - though improved - are vulnerable to further stress. Canara raised fresh equity of around INR11 billion (3.3% of FY16 equity) in March 2017 via a rights issuance. This moderately enhanced capital buffers against the backdrop of weak internal capital generation. Canara's asset quality remains under pressure although the pace of deterioration has eased. Specific provision cover is low but it has witnessed a gradual improvement in recent years. The bank posted positive ROA in FY17 but profitability remains under pressure given the potential for more slippages and elevated credit costs. We expect internal capital generation to gradually improve but Canara will have to raise further capital if it plans to pursue meaningful growth. It may have to do so from the capital markets since ordinary capital support from the authorities will likely be lower for FY18 and FY19. Canara's VR also reflects its position and franchise as the fifth-largest Indian bank with a particularly strong presence in the south. Bank of India (BOI) BOI is a large public-sector bank that ranks sixth in India in terms of assets. The downgrade of BOI's VR to 'b+' reflects the bank's weak core capitalisation after a significant drop (FY17 CET1 ratio: 7.2%; FY16: 8%). Pre-emptive capital support from the authorities has not been adequate to support its ratios and its capitalisation remains susceptible to further loan losses due to a larger portfolio of vulnerable loans compared with its peers. The improvement in specific provision cover (FY17: 51%; FY16: 44%) is positive but does not preclude the need for a substantial capital injection. The rating also reflects the bank's somewhat weaker capital flexibility than its peers due to its lower equity valuation and smaller free float. ICICI Bank ICICI's VR of 'bbb-' primarily reflects its solid core capital ratio, which provides the bank with good buffers to absorb pressures from current and potential asset quality stress. ICICI's NPL ratio deteriorated to 7.9% in FY17 and was accompanied by a sharp drop in its specific provision cover (40% FY17; 51% FY16), resulting in a further decline in earnings. However, the bank's structural drivers of income remain strong and continue to provide it with a solid cushion to absorb more credit costs, if required. ICICI enjoys good access to equity capital markets. It sold a stake in its life insurance subsidiary in FY17, which supported the banks' equity position and a future sale of another stake in the business could be used to further support capital. The rating also reflects the bank's strong funding profile, which is underpinned by a large share of retail term and low-cost deposits. ICICI is the third-largest bank by assets and is one of only two banks designated as a domestic systemically important bank in India. Axis Bank Axis Bank's VR of 'bbb-' reflects its above-average capitalisation, which provides the bank an adequate cushion against moderate shocks. The bank's asset quality markedly deteriorated during FY17 to 5.2% from 1.7% in FY16, leading to a sharp decline in profitability (FY17 ROA: 0.66%; FY16: 1.78%). However, its gradually improving specific provision cover (56%) and the likelihood of stabilising asset quality should limit any material drop in profitability going forward. The bank may raise fresh equity in the near term, which would bolster capital buffers. Fitch expects improving funding costs to support profitability but credit costs are likely to remain elevated in FY18. Axis Bank's low-cost deposit ratio of 51% is among the highest in the industry. SENIOR DEBT The senior debt ratings of SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Canara Bank are at the same level as their IDRs as the debts represent unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the banks. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT The VRs of Bank of Baroda, PNB, Canara Bank and Bank of India are lower than their SRFs and their IDRs may be downgraded if factors underpinning the SRFs weaken. For SBI and ICICI Bank, where the VRs and SRFs are at the same level, their IDRs would only be downgraded if both the SRFs and the VRs were to be downgraded. A downgrade of India's sovereign rating will trigger a downgrade of the banks' IDRs that are at the same level as the sovereign. Likewise, a change in the sovereign's Outlook will also lead to a revision of the Outlooks on the banks' IDRs. However, a sovereign upgrade may not necessarily lead to an equivalent change in the IDRs of banks. Axis Bank's IDR is solely driven by its VR and a downgrade to its VR will lead to a downgrade in its IDR. Any changes in the banks' IDRs would result in equivalent changes in their senior debt ratings. VIABILITY RATING The 'bbb-' VRs of the private banks, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, remain sensitive to any unexpected and/or significant asset quality deterioration, particularly if that is accompanied by a reduction in capital buffers, which currently support their ratings. The VRs of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank may also move down if the sovereign is downgraded as it is not common to have bank VRs above the sovereign rating due to operating environment-related risks. There is a negative bias on the VRs of SBI, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB, which are sensitive to rising pressures on asset quality and capitalisation. These VRs factor in Fitch's expectation of fresh capital injections, the absence of which may weaken the banks' capital positions if asset quality continues to deteriorate. The VR of SBI is also sensitive to downward movement in the sovereign rating or Outlook. Bank of India's capital buffers are the lowest among its peers and an inability to materially improve capital buffers through fresh capital injections could lead to further rating action on the bank's VR. The theme of consolidation among public-sector banks has gained momentum in recent months. The authorities appear keen to reduce the number of government-owned banks and it is likely that the larger public-sector banks may be asked to play an active role to that effect. The intrinsic financial position of many public-sector banks is relatively weak and any proposed merger could put further pressure on their VRs if the additional risk is not mitigated through adequate capital injections. SUPPORT RATINGS (SRs) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORs (SRFs) The SRs and SRFs are determined by the agency's assessment of the government's propensity and ability to support a bank, based on the bank's relative size and systemic importance. A change in the government's ability to provide extraordinary support due to a change in the sovereign ratings would affect the SRs and SRFs. The SRs and SRFs will also be impacted by any change in the government's propensity to extend timely support. The rating actions are as follows: SBI: - Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable - Short-Term IDR affirmed at F3' - Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb-' - Support Rating affirmed at '2' - Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BBB-' - USD10bn MTN programme affirmed at 'BBB-' - USD4.65bn senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'BBB-' PNB: - Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable - Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F3' - Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb' - Support Rating affirmed at '2' - Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BBB-' Bank of Baroda: - Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable - Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F3' - Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' - Support Rating affirmed at '2' - Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BBB-' - USD3bn MTN Programme affirmed at 'BBB-' - USD1bn senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'BBB-' BOBNZ: - Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable - Support Rating affirmed at '2' Canara Bank: - Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable - Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F3' - Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb' - Support Rating affirmed at '2' - Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BBB-' - USD2bn MTN programme affirmed at 'BBB-' - USD500m senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'BBB-' Bank of India: - Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable - Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F3' - Viability Rating downgraded to 'b+', from 'bb-' - Support Rating affirmed at '2' - Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BBB-' - USD5bn medium-term note programme affirmed at 'BBB-' - USD1.75bn senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'BBB-' ICICI Bank: - Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable - Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F3' - Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb-' - Support Rating affirmed at '2' - Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BBB-' - USD3.2bn senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'BBB-' Axis Bank: - Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable - Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F3' - Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb-' - Support Rating affirmed at '3' - Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' - USD5bn MTN programme affirmed at 'BBB-' - USD2bn senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'BBB-' Contact: Primary Analyst Ambreesh Srivastava Senior Director +65 6796 7218 Fitch Ratings Singapore Pte Ltd.

The Fed's Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to take part in a discussion in London later on Tuesday. Investors expect her to underline her positive view on the U.S. economy, which would support the Fed's forecast of a rate hike this year. But softer-than-expected U.S. data overnight gave rise to some caution. New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter.  Her words will be scrutinized for any colour about the timing of the next rate hike against a backdrop of mounting concerns over the inflation outlook,  said strategists at Societe Generale in a note to clients. A number of other top central bank officials are also expected speak at events on Tuesday, including the ECB's Mario Draghi, the Bank of England's Mark Carney and Fed officials Patrick Harker and Neel Kashkari. The dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of six major currencies, though it hit a five-week high against the Japanese yen. Fed officials have stuck to their hawkish scripts, which is in stark contrast to the firmly dovish view expressed by Draghi against exiting super easy monetary policy too quickly. European stocks gave up some of their gains from the previous session, dragged lower by weakness in consumer-related stocks. Autos in particular were hit after a profit-warning from German parts maker Schaeffler. Firmer metals and oil prices as well as upbeat data on Chinese industrial profits helped mining shares recover recent losses. Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, gained 0.6 percent to $46.12 per barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 0.6 percent to $43.61 per barrel. Gold prices, which tumbled to their lowest level in nearly six weeks on Monday after large sell order sent ripples through the market, steadied, supported by an easing dollar. Spot gold was up 0.4 percent to $1249.45 per ounce. (Reporting by Vikram Subhedar; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets-idUSL8N1JO1AG"},

Spreadbetters expected a slightly higher open for Britain's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's CAC. Yellen is scheduled to take part in a discussion on global economic issues at the British Academy in London and a number of other top Fed officials are also due to speak later in the global day. Japan's benchmark Nikkei was last up 0.3 percent at 20,210.09 in subdued trading. A rise above 20,318.11, a peak scaled a week ago, would take the Nikkei to its highest since August 2015.  The fundamental mood is not bad, but it's hard for investors to find direction on a day where there are no other major catalysts other than a weak yen,  said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. Despite lower Treasury yields, the dollar extended overnight gains and was firm at 111.800 yen after briefly rising to a one-month peak of 112.075. Long-dated Treasury yields dropped to seven-month lows on Monday and the yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds fell to its flattest level since 2007 after the weak U.S. durable goods orders raised concerns about tepid growth and slowing  inflation. The euro was steady at $1.1189 having fallen back from an 11-day high of $1.1220 overnight after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi defended the central bank's easy monetary policy. Otherwise, Asian markets lacked strong direction as Wall Street provided few catalysts after the S&P; 500 and the Dow closed overnight effectively flat. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan stood little changed. Having made record highs during the past two months on expectations that exporters will post strong earnings, South Korea's KOSPI rose a further 0.3 percent. Elsewhere, Shanghai's benchmark index and Australian shares were both down 0.1 percent. There was also a general sense of caution in financial markets, analysts said, noting that commodities like crude oil, which is suffering from a glut, remained shaky though a recent selloff has stalled.  Although iron ore and crude prices are stabilising, their recovery lacks strength. The U.S. equity market also hovers at a high level, but its performance is spotty with high-tech shares falling,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. Crude oil was on track to rise for the fourth straight day although concerns over a festering supply glut capped prices. U.S. crude futures were up 0.2 percent at $43.48 a barrel. The contract had retreated to a 10-month low of $42.05 a barrel last week before the sharp retreat stalled, but it remained on track for a monthly loss of about 10 percent.

Investors representing 65.52 percent of Stada's equity signed up for the bid, below a 67.5 percent threshold, despite the 49 percent premium offered by the buyout groups to trump a rival offer from private equity duo Advent and Permira. The new offer is unlikely to see the price increased, but may come with a lower acceptance threshold, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter isn't public.      Before launching a new bid, however, Bain and Cinven want irrevocable commitments from investors that they will tender their shares, the sources said.     Any new bid launched within a year would need recommendation from Stada's executive and supervisory boards and approval by financial watchdog Bafin, as German takeover rules otherwise bar Bain and Cinven from amending their offer a second time. The buyout groups made an initial proposal of 58 euros per share before tabling their 66 euros per share bid in April. The sources said investors such as hedge funds held back some of their shares, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock after a successful initial tender offer. But the buyout groups also struggled to galvanize non-professional, often elderly investors, many of whom the bidders feared were ignoring or forgetting letters from their custodian banks. A relatively large 27 percent of shares are held by retail investors. Index tracking funds that cannot tender initially but only after a successful deal hold about 12 percent of the stock. Lowering the acceptance hurdle too far under any new offer would complicate the buyers' efforts to get debt financing for the deal because the German takeover code requires at least 75 percent ownership for full access to a target company's cash, which could then be used to back the borrowing. Cinven declined to comment, while Bain was not immediately available for comment.  Stada shares, which touched a record high last month, fell to 56.51 euros, their lowest level since April, but later trimmed their losses to trade around 3 percent lower. Bain and Cinven had offered 66 euros per share. While former counterbidders Advent and Permira remain interested in Stada, they are not expected to take immediate action to put together a new bid, but will wait to see if Bain and Cinven launch a second attempt, people close to the matter said. Advent and Permira declined to comment.  We had been expecting the deal to go through as we had viewed the offer as a great deal for shareholders, so we view this as a significant setback,  Jefferies analyst James Vane-Tempest wrote, who has a  hold  rating on Stada shares. Many buyout firms are flush with cash after recent divestments and amid cheap borrowing costs. They are particularly attracted to healthcare assets for their reliable cash flows and resistance to swings in the business cycle.  We respect the close vote of our shareholders and understand it as a mandate to press ahead with our successful growth strategy,  Chief Executive Matthias Wiedenfels said.  However, we also regard this decision as a mark of confidence in Stada’s abilities, which our employees have impressively demonstrated, in particular over the past months.    Stada said the termination of the deal did not have an impact on its earnings targets. For 2017, Stada still expects sales adjusted for currency and portfolio effects of 2.28 billion to 2.35 billion euros, with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 430 million to 450 million euros.

NATO ally Turkey, which views the YPG as a threat, has said Mattis assured it in a letter that the United States would eventually take back the weapons it was giving them once Islamic State was defeated. Mattis, in his first public remarks on the issue, did not directly dispute that account.  We'll do what we can,  Mattis told reporters during his flight to Germany, when asked about weapons recovery. But Mattis also noted that YPG fighters were well-armed even before the U.S. last month decided to offer more specialized equipment for its urban assault on Islamic State-held city of Raqqa. Mattis also said the battle against Islamic State would continue even after Raqqa was captured and focused his answers about U.S. weapons' recovery on items he believed the YPG would no longer need in battle. Asked if Kurdish militia would revert to their pre-Raqqa level of armaments once the fight was over, Mattis responded:  Well, we'll see. It depends what the next mission is. I mean, it's not like the fight's over when Raqqa's over.  Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK, which has been waging an insurgency in the country's southeast since the mid-1980s. It has said supplies to the YPG have in the past ended up in PKK hands, describing any weapons given to the force as a threat to its security. The U.S., however, sees the YPG as an essential ally in the campaign to defeat Islamic State in Raqqa, the jihadists' main urban base in Syria. Mattis will meet his Turkish counterpart, Defence Minister Fikri Isik, on Thursday in Brussels. The U.S., Mattis said, in the near-term would be recovering weapons that the group does not need anymore as the battle advances.  We'll be recovering (the weapons) during the battle, repairing them. When they don't need certain things anymore, we'll replace those with something they do need,  Mattis said.

Romania's president named economy minister Mihai Tudose as premier on Monday, clearing the way for a new leftist-led government to be formed by the end of this week.     At 0756 GMT, the leu was 0.24 percent stronger, trading at 4.5665 versus the euro, continuing its drift from 4-1/2-year lows approached last week as lawmakers ousted Tudose's predecessor in a no-confidence vote. Other central European currencies were little changed.     Analysts said concerns over fiscal loosening and overshooting budget targets would continue to weigh on the leu in the long term.

Xinhua news agency named the minister as Li Ganjie, 52, who takes up the job less than a month after he was named the new party chief of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. On his first day in that job, he told staff to take environmental protection to  a new level  and wage a  protracted battle  against pollution. He takes over the job from Chen Jining, who was appointed acting mayor of Beijing last month.   A former masters student in nuclear reactor engineering at Tsinghua University, Li spent nine years as a vice-minister in charge of nuclear safety at the ministry before leaving to become deputy party secretary of Hebei province in October last year. Hebei, the location of six of China's 10 smoggiest cities in the first five months of this year and one of the front lines of China's war on pollution, is likely to remain a key focus of Li's work. Hebei has promised to put in place the  strictest environmental protection system  by 2020, with targets to cut air pollution and improve soil and water quality throughout the province.

Blue Label, the largest distributor of pre-paid voice and data airtime in South Africa, said it would buy shares in unlisted 3G Mobile Proprietary Limited in two stages with its subsidiary, The Prepaid Company Proprietary, initially acquiring 47.37 percent for 900 million rand followed by 52.63 percent to be acquired for 1 billion rand. Blue Label said 3G Mobile would be used to expand into the financing and supply of mobile devices, handsets and allied products to distribute into the low cost smartphone market.  Both of these functions supplement Blue Label's strategic objectives to provide value added services to both Cell C and its own customer base. 3G Mobile provides the ideal platform to consolidate Blue Label's low cost and certified pre-owned mobile handset divisions into a consolidated group,  the company said in a statement. South Africa's third largest mobile phone company, Cell C, and its creditors agreed a deal where Blue Label would pay 5.5 billion rand for a 45 percent stake in the debt-laden mobile firm. The deal will give Blue Label a share of profits on a product it distributes as well as a major stake in a company facing a consumer backlash due to slow network speeds. 3G Mobile, which is one of Africa’s largest distributors, and financiers, of mobile devices and handsets, operates in 8 African countries.

Deutsche Telekom has long sought a buyer for T-Mobile US, which accounts for most of its profits and growth. It has talked in the past to Sprint, AT&T; and Dish but more recently has indicated it wants to keep control.  We are extremely successful in the U.S. Our growth is double-digit in the U.S. We added a million subscribers for 14 quarters in a row. The U.S. is bigger than our European business and our management there is fantastic,  Tim Hoettges said. His comments to reporters late on Monday were made before news broke that Sprint, the fourth largest mobile operator in the U.S., was in talks with cable companies Charter Communications and Comcast about a partnership. Shares in Deutsche Telekom were down 2.1 percent by 0810 GMT on Tuesday, at the bottom of the STOXX Europe 600 Telecommunications index which was down 0.9 percent.  The probability for this transaction gets hit hard,  a Frankfurt-based trader said about a potential deal between Sprint and T-Mobile US.  Still, the company is also very attractive on a standalone basis.  Sources told Reuters on Monday that an agreement between Sprint and the cable providers over its network does not preclude Sprint from seeking a merger agreement with T-Mobile. Deutsche Telekom has 64 percent control of T-Mobile US. Hoettges declined to give any comment about possible consolidation in the United States, saying only that the market remained more attractive than Europe.  The conditions of the U.S. market are clearly better. There are consistent policies for a single market of 330 million customers, while in Europe we can't get it done. The market is too regulated,  Hoettges said. Earlier this year, Reuters reported Softbank, which owns the majority of Sprint, was prepared to give up control of Sprint to T-Mobile US to clinch a merger of the two U.S. wireless carriers, according to people familiar with the matter.

Shares in the company were down 2.6 percent at 415 pence at 0810 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.  High level of tendering activity is evidence of greater confidence in our core markets and we continue to have a very good pipeline of bidding opportunities,  CEO Ayman Asfari said in a statement. Bidding activity in the first half of the year was consistent with Petrofac's guidance of higher activity in its core Middle Eastern markets, CFO Alastair Cochran told Reuters. Full-year underlying net profit would be weighted towards the second half of the year in a ratio of about 40:60 percent, he added. Order book stood at $13 billion as of May 31, said the company, which builds and operates oil and gas facilities. It recorded an order book value of $14.3 billion in 2016 as orders picked up in its core Middle Eastern markets. The company's high exposure to the Middle Eastern oil markets resulted in good backlog coverage for 2017 as record production in the region drove up contract awards. Petrofac is under investigation by the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for its dealings with Monaco-based Unaoil, which Petrofac said it had engaged primarily in Kazakhstan to provide local consultancy services between 2002 and 2009. Petrofac suspended its chief operating officer, Marwan Chedid, last month in response to the investigation, raising concerns among investors about the company's ability to win work. CFO Cochran said on Tuesday the company was engaged with the SFO and had not paid any penalty, when asked if the company had set aside cash in case of a fine.

Fed officials have signalled they will look through a slowdown in inflation and continue on their current trajectory of interest rate hikes - though investors are sceptical and market pricing shows only a 40 percent chance of a rise at the Fed's December meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen addresses the British Academy in London at 1700 GMT, less than two hours after an address by Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in the same city at 1515 GMT.

The government said in a statement that it would form a committee that would spend about three months deciding whether or not construction of the plants should continue. The move comes after the country's new president, Moon Jae-in, said South Korea would stop building new nuclear power plants and not extend the lifespan of old reactors to address public concerns over atomic safety. The part-completed Shin Kori No.5 and Shin Kori No.6 are located near the city of Busan, some 300 km (186 miles) southeast of Seoul. They were scheduled to be completed by March 2021 and March 2022 respectively. If construction was scrapped, potential costs including compensation would be about 2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion), South Korea's Office for Government Policy and Coordination said in the statement. South Korea is currently running 24 nuclear reactors after it permanently closed its oldest nuclear reactor, Kori No.1, last week. Nuclear power generates about one-third of the nation's electricity.

Sota Fujii, who trains himself with computer software and was the youngest player ever to turn professional, surpassed the previous record of 28 consecutive wins on Monday.      His feat, a rare bright spot in a nation grappling with more than 15 years of deflation and stagnation, drew applause from all walks of life ranging from avid shogi fans to the prime minister. His picture was all over Tuesday's front pages.   Young power has made history. This victory gives dreams and hopes to the Japanese people,  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters. After a grueling 11-hour match on Monday with a 19-year-old fellow professional, Fujii was calm before reporters.      Winning 29 straight matches was beyond my wildest imagination. I'm delighted, but I'm very surprised as well,  Fujii said. The object of shogi, also known as Japanese chess, is to checkmate the opponent's king, as in the Western game. But there are no black and white squares or pieces, and most pieces can only move one square at a time. Japan's youngest professional shogi player, 14-year-old Sota Fujii (L), is pictured after defeating fellow fourth-dan player Yasuhiro Masuda (R), 19, in the prestigious Ryuo Championship finals at the Shogi Kaikan hall in Tokyo, Japan June 26, 2017. Picture taken June 26, 2017. Kyodo/via REUTERSFollowing the centuries-old shogi tradition, Fujii has a senior professional shogi player as an official mentor.  But his game has improved significantly since he started training with computer software about a year and a half ago, frowned on by many professional shogi players, the Asahi Shimbun daily said.      A professional shogi player is lucky if he has as many as 1,000 matches in his lifetime. An artificial intelligence-based programme has several thousand times more matches than that virtually, and accumulates expertise,  a Japan Shogi Association official said.  Professional players understand computers' strength and their way of thinking is now shifting to how to use AI to improve their own strength.  Fujii's winning streak comes after Google's AI programme, AlphaGo, beat Chinese Go master Ke Jie last month in a best of three series meant to test the limits of computers in taking on humans at complex tasks.      Ke, the world's No.1 Go player, is 19, while Norway's Magnus Carlsen, the current world chess champion, became a chess grandmaster at 13.

The chief executive was speaking at a closed-door conference and his comments were referred by a company spokesman. On Monday sources said Italy's Open Fiber was close to sealing a deal with Acea to use the utility's infrastructure in Rome to roll out ultrafast broadband in the capital. Open Fiber, the broadband business owned by Italy's biggest utility Enel and state lender CDP, has been seeking to do deals with utilities across Italy as it takes on Telecom Italia in its network investments.

Sota Fujii, who trains himself with computer software and was the youngest player ever to turn professional, surpassed the previous record of 28 consecutive wins on Monday.      His feat, a rare bright spot in a nation grappling with more than 15 years of deflation and stagnation, drew applause from all walks of life ranging from avid shogi fans to the prime minister. His picture was all over Tuesday's front pages.   Young power has made history. This victory gives dreams and hopes to the Japanese people,  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters. After a grueling 11-hour match on Monday with a 19-year-old fellow professional, Fujii was calm before reporters.      Winning 29 straight matches was beyond my wildest imagination. I'm delighted, but I'm very surprised as well,  Fujii said. The object of shogi, also known as Japanese chess, is to checkmate the opponent's king, as in the Western game. But there are no black and white squares or pieces, and most pieces can only move one square at a time. Japan's youngest professional shogi player, 14-year-old Sota Fujii (L), is pictured after defeating fellow fourth-dan player Yasuhiro Masuda (R), 19, in the prestigious Ryuo Championship finals at the Shogi Kaikan hall in Tokyo, Japan June 26, 2017. Picture taken June 26, 2017. Kyodo/via REUTERSFollowing the centuries-old shogi tradition, Fujii has a senior professional shogi player as an official mentor.  But his game has improved significantly since he started training with computer software about a year and a half ago, frowned on by many professional shogi players, the Asahi Shimbun daily said.      A professional shogi player is lucky if he has as many as 1,000 matches in his lifetime. An artificial intelligence-based programme has several thousand times more matches than that virtually, and accumulates expertise,  a Japan Shogi Association official said.  Professional players understand computers' strength and their way of thinking is now shifting to how to use AI to improve their own strength.  Fujii's winning streak comes after Google's AI programme, AlphaGo, beat Chinese Go master Ke Jie last month in a best of three series meant to test the limits of computers in taking on humans at complex tasks.      Ke, the world's No.1 Go player, is 19, while Norway's Magnus Carlsen, the current world chess champion, became a chess grandmaster at 13.          No matches between Fujii and an AI-based programme is planned at the moment, the Japan Shogi Association said.

A new treaty could clear the way for closer ties in fields including financial services and power markets, but fear that any deal might upset Swiss voters under the country's system of direct democracy has put the project on hold. Without a new accord with its biggest trading partner, Switzerland would rely on a patchwork of more than 100 bilateral agreements that ease access to the EU single market. Many Swiss are happy with the status quo. But the government had made a treaty a legislative priority, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have said it was the price of any more trade deals. Swiss reluctance to follow through on an accord in the window before the EU's Brexit negotiations start in earnest threatens to put relations into a deep chill that could stall progress on unresolved trade issues. The eurosceptic Swiss People's Party (SVP), the country's largest, has opposed any treaty that lets the European Court of Justice (ECJ) settle disputes. The far right has thundered against  foreign judges  dictating to sovereign Switzerland, and conservative centrist parties have now essentially capitulated.  The government has concluded that in a referendum-based democracy this 'foreign judges' solution - having the European Court of Justice mediate in disputes - is not winnable at the moment,  Christian Democrats (CVP) leader Gerhard Pfister said. Pfister told Reuters his CVP colleague and Swiss President Doris Leuthard and even Juncker now agree that clinching a treaty by year's end is no longer realistic. A European Commission spokeswoman said:  We are making good progress since the meeting between President Juncker and President Leuthard in April and are confident that if efforts continue from both sides in that sense, the agreed timetable can be met.  Not Much at Stake? The CVP and pro-business Liberals (FDP) each have two seats in the seven-member cabinet, so an EU treaty is dead in the water without their backing. As their support faded, it undermined pro-Europe Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter, who this month announced his resignation and said a new cabinet player was needed to change the political dynamics on Europe. The flags of the European Union and Switzerland flutter in the wind in Blotzheim, France June 27, 2017.Arnd WiegmannStill, Pfister doubted a fresh minister could nudge Switzerland out of its  time out  on Europe policy, especially as Swiss business leaders are not lobbying hard for a treaty.  Of course it would help some politicians if business would fully support something but right from the beginning we were skeptical,  said Jan Atteslander, head of foreign economic ties at business lobby Economiesuisse. A treaty would not in itself expand business ties, but instead set out how Switzerland could fall under the aegis of EU institutions such as ECJ judgments or state aid rules in return for market access.  This poses a problem as the Swiss do not want to be subject to these things. We have been discussing this for over three years and are now in the 17th or 18th round of talks,  said a Swiss official familiar with the discussions. The parties now settle disputes though a joint commission, which under a treaty would do so after guidance from the ECJ. Slideshow (2 Images)Pfister suspected the EU was keen for a quick deal with Switzerland to  pacify the Swiss flank  while turning its main attention to thorny Brexit talks with Britain.  We will wait and see how the Brexit negotiations go and then perhaps adopt a position similar to the UK,  he added. Preventing Triumph for Far Right Pfister's remarks reflect many Swiss conservatives' thinking that the freedom of movement principle so dear to the EU - it allows the bloc's workers access to Swiss jobs, and nearly prompted a crisis last year over Switzerland's plans for immigration curbs - is bound to change over time. This may help Switzerland, which faces unease over immigration in a country whose population is already a quarter foreign but is keen to preserve its EU market access. One EU diplomat dismissed this as  wishful thinking , saying failure to lock in ties with the bloc now could come back to haunt the Swiss.  People in Brussels don't like cherry-pickers. If things start to pick up in EU then cherry-pickers will not be very popular,  he warned.    Swiss politics are driving the shifting mood. Other referendums looming on European issues such as limiting free movement should be settled before holding a vote on a treaty, Pfister said.  If you do it before (Swiss) elections in 2019 the risk is great that you would lose, and that would hand the SVP a triumph that we wouldn't want to have,  he said.

We offer our condolences to the those who lost their lives and to those who suffered injuries,  Shigehisa Takada, chairman and CEO of Takata, said at the company's last annual shareholder meeting as a listed company. The meeting came a day after Takata, facing tens of billions of dollars in costs and liabilities following almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits, said it had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan and the United States. As part of the arrangements it will be largely acquired for $1.6 billion by the Chinese-owned U.S.-based Key Safety Systems. The grandson of the company's founder, Takada was criticized in the Japanese media for failing to address victims at a press conference announcing the bankruptcy on Monday. It was his first media appearance in more than a year and a half.  Takata Corp.

Most victims were in the United States.   I was told that I shouldn't cause any bias and that I should leave it to others,  Takada said, responding to the criticism.  I too felt shame about this.    Takada  was full of excuses,  said one female investor in her 40s from Tokyo.   Constantly blaming the media and those around him, it's not surprising things ended up like this,  she said.  The ammonium nitrate compound used in the air bags was found to become volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat, causing the devices to explode with too much force and spray shrapnel into vehicle compartments. Takata shares were untraded with a glut of sell orders on Tuesday. The company is due to be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on July 27.

The government said on Tuesday it would invest about A$20 million ($15 million) into Pilbara Minerals Ltd's Pilgangoora project in Western Australia, which will produce lithium concentrate, a key component in electric vehicles and batteries.     Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said it represented the conservative government's first investment in a mining project of its kind.  Lithium is a vital component used in battery storage, which helps to support Australia's increasing use of renewable energy,  the minister said in a statement. The move comes as the government looks to prove it is being  technology neutral  in its efforts to beef up power supply, amid a battle over whether that should include subsidies for coal-fired power. The investment is from the government's Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which took part in Pilbara Minerals' recently completed A$132 million bond issue. The proceeds of the bond issue together with A$80 million raised in a share sale will underpin the A$234 million required for the project's first stage of development. Construction is expected to start in early 2018, Pilbara Minerals said. Australia was the world's largest lithium producer in 2016, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. On the same day the government also awarded a A$2 million grant to Australian researchers developing ultra-thin, screen-printed batteries for use in both large-scale energy storage and in cheap, portable devices.  The Brisbane-based company behind the A$12 million project, Printed Energy, said the batteries would be flexible – printed in a roll-to-roll process like a newspaper – and could be adapted to almost any shape.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, gained 35 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $46.18 per barrel by 0715 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 30 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $43.68 per barrel. The gains mean the market is up slightly so far this week, after spending much of the last month in negative territory.  Oil may be close to the bottom but badly damaged sentiment and a rising (U.S.) rig count will dent the recovery,  U.S. bank Citi said on Tuesday. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its partners have been trying to reduce a global crude glut with production cuts. OPEC nations and 11 other exporters agreed in May to extend cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018. Despite the cuts, which started in January, markets remain well supplied due to rising output elsewhere. OPEC members Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the cuts and have raised production. OPEC member Iran was also allowed a small increase to recover market share lost under Western sanctions over its nuclear programme. U.S. shale oil output has risen about 10 percent since last year to 9.4 million bpd C-OUT-T-EIA, with the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation at the highest in more than three years.  Traders are also looking ahead to the EIA Energy Conference in Washington, where U.S. shale oil producers are expected to give their view of current market conditions,  ANZ bank said. Analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said demand was not growing quickly enough to absorb output, especially since imports in Asia are stuttering. A fuel glut in China, a hangover from demonetisation in India, and an ageing, declining population in Japan are holding back crude oil demand growth in three of the world's top four oil buyers.

The government said on Tuesday it would invest about A$20 million ($15 million) into Pilbara Minerals Ltd's Pilgangoora project in Western Australia, which will produce lithium concentrate, a key component in electric vehicles and batteries.     Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said it represented the conservative government's first investment in a mining project of its kind.  Lithium is a vital component used in battery storage, which helps to support Australia's increasing use of renewable energy,  the minister said in a statement. The move comes as the government looks to prove it is being  technology neutral  in its efforts to beef up power supply, amid a battle over whether that should include subsidies for coal-fired power. The investment is from the government's Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which took part in Pilbara Minerals' recently completed A$132 million bond issue. The proceeds of the bond issue together with A$80 million raised in a share sale will underpin the A$234 million required for the project's first stage of development. Construction is expected to start in early 2018, Pilbara Minerals said. Australia was the world's largest lithium producer in 2016, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. On the same day the government also awarded a A$2 million grant to Australian researchers developing ultra-thin, screen-printed batteries for use in both large-scale energy storage and in cheap, portable devices.  The Brisbane-based company behind the A$12 million project, Printed Energy, said the batteries would be flexible – printed in a roll-to-roll process like a newspaper – and could be adapted to almost any shape.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is scheduled to speak at a gathering on central banking in Portugal, while Bank of England chief Mark Carney is expected to speak at a news conference following the release of the bank's financial stability report later this session. Janet Yellen, the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve, speaks in London later in the day. Other Fed officials are also on the calendar. While the outlook for economic growth has brightened this year, subdued inflation in most major economies has cast doubts over the scale and scope for tighter monetary policies. A recent fall in oil prices has also weighed on market inflation expectations. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to seven-month lows on Monday after weak U.S. durable goods orders raised concerns about tepid growth and slowing inflation. That triggered a further flattening of yield curves, with the gap between and five and 30-year bond yields at its tightest level since 2007. The yield curve in Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy and its benchmark issuer, is close to its flattest in seven months. Germany's 10-year Bund yield was virtually flat on Tuesday at around 0.25 percent and within sight of almost two-week lows hit the previous session. Most other bond yields across the single-currency bloc were also little changed on the day. With inflation in the single-currency bloc still low, analysts expect the European Central Bank to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy stance for some time, pinning down bond yields.  The European economy is doing well and inflation is low, so it looks like a perfect world for a central bank,  said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz.  But the ECB is caught between those economies that are weak and still need monetary stimulus and those that are healthy and are saying rates are too low.  There was some focus on debt sales in the region. Germany is slated to sell 4 billion euros worth of two-year government debt, while Italy is scheduled to auction inflation-linked bonds.

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.2 percent, to 3,674.72 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index also added 0.2 percent to 3,191.20 points. Investors largely looked past news that profits at China's industrial companies surged 16.7 percent in May from a year earlier, accelerating from April despite expectations of a slowdown. With the blue-chip index trading at the highest level since early 2016, some investors aren't sure if the index can run up much further amid signs Beijing will continue to keep liquidity conditions relatively tight. Citing  relatively high  liquidity levels in the banking system, China's central bank on Tuesday skipped open market operations for a third consecutive day, as short-term borrowing rates have eased recently.  The central bank doesn't want the market to form expectations of loose liquidity,  Wang Gang, strategist at Huajin Securities, wrote.  In the future, liquidly will remain relatively tight. Under such a backdrop ... there's limited room for blue-chips to rise further.  Wang said investors were also bracing for the mid-year earnings season starting next week to reassess their portfolios. Sector performance was mixed. Gains were led by bank stocks, while real estate stocks dragged behind after jumping nearly 9 percent during the previous two sessions.

The Barclays Fortune 500 Equal Weighted Index will launch in July, tracking about 450 publicly traded companies with a combined revenue of more than $11 trillion, Dupe Adeyemo, a director at Barclays, told Reuters.  The index will exclude private companies, master limited partnerships and companies that do not meet liquidity requirements among the Fortune 500, Adeyemo said. Time, which like many of its publishing peers has been struggling as print circulation shrinks and advertisers shift to digital platforms, will aim to broaden its revenue with the partnership as index-based investing is increasing in popularity.  We're trying to be more creative about ways to expand our brand,  said Brian O'Keefe, deputy editor of Fortune magazine.  Frankly, this index should have been done a long time ago.  In addition to the magazine, the brand hosts conferences such as the  Most Powerful Women Summit  and is expanding online. Time declined to discuss the financial terms of the partnership. Revenue-weighted and profit-weighted indexes are planned for the fourth quarter this year, Adeyemo said. “We think a name like Fortune that resonates with the public … will distinguish ourselves among other ETFs that come out in the market,” Adeyemo said.  The Fortune 500 is an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks 500 of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue. It is unclear if Time Inc will be able to generate meaningful revenue by getting into the index business.   The licensing of indices is not a phenomenally lucrative business,  said Dave Nadig, chief executive officer of ETF.com, based in New York.  Time evaluated a sale earlier this year, but talks with     Meredith Corp failed when the two could not agree on price. Earlier this month, Time eliminated 300 positions or 4 percent of its workforce. Over the past 12 months, index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds pulled in $718 billion, while active funds bled $152 billion, according to the Thomson Reuters research service Lipper.

The administration of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has rejected the allegations and opposes the mission.     Fighting in Rakhine has been sporadic since the end of November, but tensions have risen over the past several weeks when village administrators were murdered and troops killed three people while clearing a Rohingya militant camp last week.     Myanmar's state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said on Tuesday a villager in northern Rakhine was  speared  while praying at the weekend, following a separate attack on a village head by a group of  at least 10 masked assailants  who stabbed the village leader to death on June 17.      The killings took place over the weekend and the situation is getting increasingly worse. A group of people wearing black masks has killed local administrators close to the government, so the residents are panicking. That's why we are on high alert,  Rakhine state police chief, Sein Lwin, told Reuters.     Sein Lwin and a military source operating in the area said security forces expected fresh Rohingya militant attacks on troops after Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, which ended in Myanmar on Monday.     It was not immediately clear how many people have been killed in recent violence, nor who was behind it, because the military sealed off the area in October, cutting off access to information.     Kyaw Win, a Rakhine ethnic villager, said nearly 200 villagers from 11 Rakhine ethnic villages had fled to the cities of Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Sittwe.      We don't dare to live here, there are a lot of rumors spreading among the people that we will be attacked by Muslims,  Kyaw Win told Reuters by telephone.     Rohingya refugees in makeshift settlements in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar have also organized self-defense patrols to guard against masked men roaming the camps at night in recent weeks, Reuters sources in the camps have said.     Bangladesh forces near the Myanmar border were also put on high alert after reports of violence at the weekend, said Lieutenant Colonel SM Ariful Islam.

Rosneft last year became Russia's largest independent gas producer and ranked sixth among global, listed gas producers, Sechin said.

If oil prices stay at $40 per barrel for a prolonged period, half of global oil production would become loss-making, including in Brazil and Canada, with shale oil producers also likely to face  difficulties , Sechin wrote.  Only producers from Russia, Saudi Arabia, as well as a number of efficient projects in the United States, Iran and in some other countries with relatively low production costs are able to remain steady at low oil prices,  he wrote.  All other producers will have to go.  Rosneft plans to open a trading office in Singapore, Sechin added.

As lawmakers digested details of the rescue, which involves the state rather than investors bearing most of the cost, many criticised Rome for breaking with the spirit of a framework known as banking union -- and the European Commission in Brussels for allowing it do so. Under a deal sealed over the weekend, Italy will pay more than 5 billion euros to Intesa Sanpaolo, its top retail bank, to take the best assets of two failed Veneto banks, with up to 12 billion euros of guarantees to shield Intesa from losses. That broke a principle agreed by European leaders and enshrined in European Union law that investors, rather than the state, should shoulder the cost of bank failures.  It was all for nothing,  said Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green party member of the European Parliament who spent months negotiating and writing the law introduced last year.  This is a bad day for Europe. It's another hit to European integration,  he said, describing it as a  major blow  to the euro currency itself and damaging for the image of the European Central Bank, which supervises Europe's biggest lenders. Sven Giegold, an EU parliamentarian who also helped write the law, demanded a parliamentary enquiry into the flouting of the rules, attacking the Commission, the EU's executive. It had the final say in approving the scheme. Investors breathed a sigh of relief following the decision, with shares rallying, while Italy sought to portray the move in a positive light. It removes one of the chief financial headaches facing the country. One Bank of Italy official even said that the state could eventually make a profit from the deal. But European lawmakers struck a more sombre tone. Frosty Reception Markus Ferber, a German lawmaker in the European parliament, said Italy had not respected the new rules and predicted that Germany would be reluctant to pursue closer ties in the 19-member euro zone as a result.  This is bringing banking union to the graveyard,  said Ferber, a member of Bavaria's Christian Democrats, the sister party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling conservatives.  It makes no sense to have further integration,  he said, citing the example of pan-European protection of deposits, the next step that had been planned for the banking union.  No-one could seriously grant Italy access to deposit protection.  Germany, worried that it would have to shoulder the bill for failed banks in countries such as Greece or Spain, had been central in writing the rules to force losses on the bondholders and large depositors of failing banks. Germany's finance ministry also gave the Italian announcement a frosty reception.  The use of state aid should be avoided as much as possible in bankruptcy cases,  a spokeswoman for finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said, adding that it was up to the European Commission to ensure that the rules were respected. Rome had hoped healthier Italian banks would club together to help the lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. But most would not, having already spent billions propping up other ailing banks. Italy's subsequent move to sidestep the EU regime now raises a question mark over the entire framework and whether it can ever be used instead of taxpayer bailouts. The events also cast a cloud over the ECB, which monitored the banks and had deemed them solvent until recently. It declined to comment. That Italian solution contrasts with Santander's recent rescue of a struggling lender in Spain, where it too paid just 1 euro but took on the smaller bank's troubled loans and imposed losses on shareholders, including retail investors. Alberto Ruiz Ojeda, a lawyer from the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholders who is representing Banco Popular investors taking action after the rescue, said the move by Italy would encourage more of those who lost money to sue.  Intesa Sanpaolo is going to benefit from a scheme that Banco Santander has not been able to,  he said.  What we see is discriminatory and unfair treatment. This will give rise to more claims, both from Popular shareholders and bondholders.  While German politicians were among the most vocal critics, lawmakers from other countries also expressed dismay. Greece's banks received more robust treatment and the capital controls introduced to stabilise the country's feebler banks and financial system are still in place.  It is not a fair world. It is obvious that Italy is quite another country to Greece,  said Kostas Chrysogonos, a European lawmaker with Greece's left-wing Syriza party, recalling the strict terms imposed on Athens.  What you have is more a cooperation of states and not an authentic union.

Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report that East Asian steel prices are clearly turning up after bottoming in early June.

Passage of the bill fulfils a campaign promise of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and is projected to delay the possibility of a default in payments to retirees by a decade. Instead of 18 percent, pensions will receive nine percent from July 2018 until the end of 2020, and then be reduced to zero starting in 2021. The bill only covers civil servants. Additional legislation reforming the pension system for teachers and the military will be reviewed later. Lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition Kuomintang were not immediately available for comment. Pension reform is critical for Taiwan as large payouts are no longer sustainable for the export-reliant economy, with contributions crimped by slower economic growth and a rapidly aging population. The plan has angered public servants, many of whom say it will ruin their retirement plans. Thousands of military personnel, teachers, police and civil servants have protested against the plan several times. Pensions for civil servants could default by 2030, teachers by 2031, and other workers by 2048, government data shows, if the system is not reformed.

Alibaba-backed Best Inc wants to list in New York just a few months after a rival's disappointing debut. The loss-making group is faster-growing and more diverse. But the extra complexity could make this a hard sell for already wary investors. Hangzhou-based Best is looking to raise around $1 billion, according to someone familiar with the deal. That would make this the largest Chinese flotation in the United States since a competing delivery outfit, ZTO, raised $1.4 billion in October. But ZTO is now trading about 26 percent below its initial public offering price. That is partly because of an overly aggressive IPO price. But competition is robust, costs are rising, and ZTO is becoming more capital-intensive. Best is hoping to stand apart. Demand for logistics in China is soaring as both brick-and-mortar shops and online giants Alibaba and JD race to deliver goods to web-savvy consumers. Unlike the $11 billion ZTO, which focuses on the fiercely competitive delivery sector, Best wants to offer a far wider range of services. These include helping sellers manage supply chains, for example by operating warehouses, and sourcing merchandise for corner stores. That bid for differentiation is a bit of a stretch. It is true that top-line growth has been impressive. Last year, revenue jumped 68 percent to $1.3 billion. But Best is not yet profitable. And it remains heavily reliant on delivery: express and freight services accounted for almost 80 percent of total sales. To make matters worse, the group is playing catch-up with the likes of ZTO for market share. Prospective buyers will need to believe in the potential of the newer businesses, and to understand clearly how it all fits together. The closest competitors are the logistics arms of JD and Amazon – but these are not standalone, profit-making companies. And like ZTO, its delivery unit is heavily dependent on business from Alibaba’s sites. This adds up to a less-than-straightforward package.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The retailer, in the middle of a turnaround programme led by new Chief Executive Sergio Bucher, reported a 0.9 percent fall in group like-for-like sales in the 15 weeks to June 17, its fiscal third quarter. It said it anticipated that 2017 profit before tax would be within the range of market expectations. However, it said that should current market volatility continue, the outcome could be towards the lower end of the current range. The update was the first since April, when Bucher detailed the outcome of his strategic review. He plans to return the group to profit growth by closing some stores, revamping the rest and improving its online service. He also plans to seek efficiencies by simplifying the business. Debenhams said a more solid performance in areas including Beauty, Accessories and Food & Drink had helped to mitigate the impact of a weaker clothing market. Prior to Tuesday's update analysts were forecasting an underlying pretax profit for 2016-17 of around 100 million pounds, according to Reuters data, down from 114 million in 2015-16.  As industry data has confirmed, May was a tough month for retailers and we continue to see volatility in trading week to week,  Bucher said.  As a result we are focused on delivering cost control and self-help through our  Fix the Basics  plan.

Companies Italy Banks Italy does not expect any more banks to need state aid after reaching a deal to wind down two ailing regional lenders, Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said on Monday. Intesa Sanpaolo Moody's Investors Service said Intesa Sanpaolo's acquisition of good assets of failing banks Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza is credit positive because they will increase the bank's current client base and unlock economies of scale. CEO Carlo Messina told la Repubblica in an interview that the acquisition of the two Veneto-based banks did not change Intesa's focus on wealth management as far as its new business plan was concerned. Banca Carige The bank's new CEO Paolo Fiorentino is studying the outcome of a due diligence Prelios Credit Servicing carried out on Carige's bad loans as it does not match the lender's own data, Il Sole 24 Ore reported. The paper said the ECB wanted the bank to improve coverage of unlikely-to-pay loans and that the size of a planned capital increase could rise above 650 million euros. Contrary to a previous plan, Carige prefers to raise fresh capital without converting subordinated debt. Banco Bpm, Unipol, Generali The bancassurance agreement between Banco Popolare and Unipol, Popolare Vita, should be terminated by the companies before the end of the week, Il Messaggero said. Generali, Zurich and and France's Covea are knocking on the door of Banco BPM, it said. Mediaset Institutional investors representing 13 percent of the company's capital have confirmed they will attend Wednesday's annual general meeting, la Repubblica reported, adding this meant that there was a good chance the broadcaster would win approval of a proposed buyback of treasury shares. Yoox Net-a-Porter Shares in Italian online fashion retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter closed up almost 9 percent on Monday as traders cited reported interest from China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. But a source familiar with the matter later denied the report. Terna Terna said it had completed the acquisition from Gruppo Planova of two licenses for the creation and operation of around 500 km of electricity infrastructure in Brazil. The deal, announced in February, is worth around $180 million. Bim The head of Italy's BIM said on Monday he was confident the private banking group would be sold on the market quickly following the decision to liquidate its main shareholder Veneto Banca.

The Reserve Bank of India has asked banks to set aside at least 50 percent of the loan amount for accounts referred to bankruptcy courts, The Economic Times reported on Monday citing two bankers familiar with the order. The move could hurt banks' earnings to the tune of 500 billion rupees, it reported. bit.ly/2tgJkLG Analysts expect government-owned banks to be the worst affected as they hold the chunk of defaulted loans in the country.  PSU banks will be under pressure for some more time as improvement in earnings for these banks will get delayed due to higher provisioning requirement,  said Siddharth Purohit, senior research analyst at Angel Broking. The broader NSE index was down 0.46 percent at 9,531.20 as of 0554 GMT, after touching its lowest since May 26, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.31 percent lower at 31,041.95.

For the first five months of the year, profits reached 2.9 trillion yuan ($424 billion), up 22.7 percent from the same period of last year although the growth pace was lower than the 24.4 percent annual rate for January-April 2017.  The quickened growth of China's industrial profits was partly due to a low-base effect at the same time a year earlier, which marked the second slowest growth over the course of last year,  statistics bureau official He Ping said in a statement on Tuesday.  Operating costs as a proportion of operating revenue rose on an annual basis for a third consecutive month in May, which He said needed to be closely watched. Profit growth at private enterprises and foreign enterprises fell to 14.0 percent and 18.9 percent respectively in the year to May, from 14.3 percent and 19.8 percent in January-April. Nomura analysts this growth noted was driven by  increased investment gains  and  net non-operating incomes , terms often used to refer to property profits.   Our concerns over growth quality remain,  they said. Profits at China's state-owned firms enterprises (SOE) were up 53.3 percent at 652.04 billion yuan in January-May, compared with a 58.7 percent rise in the first four months.  The low base is likely to support high profit growth of SOEs for a few more months,  Nomura said. PRODUCER PRICE INFLATION  China's factory gate inflation eased for the third straight month in May on sagging prices for raw materials, signaling a broader cooling in economic activity as profits are squeezed by slackening domestic demand and rising financing costs.[L3N1J42YF]  The return of PPI deflation should also lead to lower industrial profit growth,  Nomura said.   Concerns about China grew after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating last month. The agency said it expects Chinese financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise.     China's statistics bureau said this month that economic performance in the January-May period laid a solid foundation for achieving the full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent. China's strong growth prompted the International Monetary Fund this month to raise its 2017 growth forecast to 6.7 percent from 6.6 percent. Capital Economics, which forecast last year that China's economic rebound would run out of steam early in 2017 as policy support was withdrawn, said last week that the predicted slowdown would be  mild  with growth dropping back towards  a sustainable pace . Still, with half a year left to go, the economy is expected to handily meet its annual growth target without hitting too many bumps, good news for President Xi Jinping ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle later this year.     The data encompasses companies with annual operating revenue of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.

Headline earnings per share (EPS), the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out certain one-off items, fell to 881 cents for the year ended March 31 from 944 cents in the previous period. The fertiliser, chemicals and mining explosives maker said its profit after tax was down 8 percent to 592 million rand ($46 million) following lower operating profit.  The slowdown in global economic activity remains a key driver for the demand of the various commodities and therefore, the inability for a sustained increase in prices for Omnia's products to materialise in the short to medium term,  said Omnia in a statement. Group revenue dipped to 16.3 billion rand on a weaker performance from the Mining and Chemicals divisions. The mining unit saw revenue fall 4 percent to 4.4 billion rand following a challenging year for the mining industry, with lower volumes due to mine closures in South Africa and business lost in Botswana and Namibia, the company said. Revenue in the agriculture division remained relatively flat at 8.2 billion rand, with record sales volumes for speciality fertilisers both locally and internationally. $1 = 12.8608 rand Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/omnia-holdings-results-idUSL8N1JO0O1"},

The Outlook is Stable. The agency has also affirmed the 'BB-' rating on its USD300 million 7% senior secured notes due 2021. KEY RATING DRIVERS Mid-Tier IT Services Company: HT Global owns a 71% stake in Indian IT service provider Hexaware Technologies Limited. Its ratings reflect Hexaware's mid-tier position in the global IT services industry, relatively small scale and modest cost and technology advantage over peers. However, its ratings are supported by the moderate-to-high costs to its customers of switching to competitors, diversified revenue stream in terms of products and industries served and its profitable niche with a solid customer base willing to work with the company on a recurring basis. HT Global's business profile is weaker than that of Marble II Pte. Ltd. (BB/Stable), given Marble's larger revenue base, better free cash flow (FCF) profile and minimum revenue guarantees from its customers, primarily from Hewlett Packard Enterprise- (HPE, BBB+/Stable) related clients, including DXC Technology Company (BBB+/Stable), HP Inc. (BBB+/Stable) and Micro Focus International plc. However, Marble's stronger business profile is constrained by its weaker financial profile, as its proportionally consolidated Fitch-forecast FFO-adjusted net leverage of 5.0x in 2018 is higher than HT Global's 4.0x-4.3x in 2017 (2016: 5.1x) on a like-for-like basis. Low Ratings Headroom: HT Global's ratings are constrained by leverage that is higher than most IT peers, which typically have minimal debt as these businesses generate stable cash flows and require minimum capex. We analyse leverage by proportionally consolidating Hexaware, given its 29% minority shareholding, and forecast 2017 FFO-adjusted net leverage to improve to around 4.0x-4.3x (2016: 5.1x), around the threshold of 4.25x above which Fitch would consider negative rating action. Except for special dividends and M&A;, we expect HT Global's leverage to improve during 2018-2020 given increasing EBITDA and ability to generate annual FCF of USD25 million-30 million. Revenue, EBITDA Growth: We forecast revenue and EBITDA growth of 8%-10% annually during 2017-2018, driven mainly by higher IT spending by existing customers. Growth is driven by new orders primarily in the infrastructure management service business in the Asia-Pacific region. Revenue visibility is high, as repeat customers contribute about 96% of revenue. HT Global has not lost any of its top-20 customers in the last 10 years. It has multiyear contracts worth around USD110 million with two out of its top-five customers, which are on take-or-pay terms. Stable Profitability: We expect HT Global's operating EBITDAR margin to remain stable at around 17.5%-18.0% (2016: 17.9%), as higher utilisation levels and cost savings will likely offset an increase in staff costs. The employee utilisation rate has improved to around 78%-79% during 1Q17 from 70% in 2015-1H16, while the billing rate has been stable at around USD72-76 per hour for onsite billing and USD23 per hour for offshore billing. We believe that a complete US H1B visa ban or major restrictions on outsourcing from the US is unlikely. However, stricter rules or delays in granting visas could increase labour costs for onsite staff. Management believes any adverse legislation will likely be prospective and would only affect the company after 2018. Hexaware intends to reduce its dependence on visas by hiring locals and nearshoring. FCF Usage to Drive Ratings: Use of Hexaware's FCF is a key consideration driving HT Global's ratings. We forecast annual FCF of around USD25 million - 30 million, as capex/revenue will likely fall to about 2% (2016: 6%) as the expansion of facilities in Pune and Chennai nears completion. Hexaware may use its FCF for M&A; and shareholder returns. During 1Q17, HT Global distributed USD27 million in dividends to its parent, Baring Asia Private Ltd, as Hexaware completed a USD20 million share buyback. We believe any M&A; to acquire newer technologies or expertise would likely be small. Notes Rated Same as IDR: The senior notes are rated in line with HT Global's Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR, as they represent its direct, unconditional, secured and unsubordinated obligations. The notes are secured by Baring's 100% equity stake in HT Global. The notes are subordinated to any potential debt at Hexaware or other operating subsidiaries. Hexaware and other operating subsidiaries do not currently have any debt and we understand management aims to keep the businesses debt-free. HT Global also has limited capacity to take on additional debt, as there is an incurrence covenant of debt/EBITDA of 3.75x (2016: 3.5x) in the bond documents. DERIVATION SUMMARY HT Global's ratings are constrained by its smaller scale, mid-tier position in the global IT services industry and modest cost and technology advantage over its peers. Its leverage is also higher than most IT peers. However, its ratings benefit from long-established customer relationships, high revenue visibility and no loss of any top-20 customers in the last 10 years. Its ability to generate positive FCF and increase EBITDA will likely improve its leverage. However, higher-than-expected shareholder returns or M&A; could negatively affect ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue to grow by 8%-10%. - Operating EBITDAR margin to remain stable around 17.5%-18.0% (2016: 17.9%) on an increase in onsite revenue delivery mix and stable utilisation rates. - Capex/revenue to remain low at around 2.0% during 2017-2018. - M&A; and shareholder returns of about USD25 million each year starting 2018. - HT Global to maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 1.0x, excluding interest reserve accounts. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - An improvement in proportionally consolidated FFO-adjusted net leverage to below 2.5x. - An improvement in market position of Hexaware, demonstrated by higher operating EBITDAR margin. - Growth in Hexaware's FCF of over USD75 million (2017 Fitch-forecast: USD25 million-30 million). Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Higher-than-expected shareholder returns, greater competition or loss of key customers leading to deterioration in proportionally consolidated FFO-adjusted net leverage to above 4.25x (2017 estimate: 4.0x-4.3x). - Operating EBITDAR margin declining to below 15% (2017 estimate: 18%) due to lower employee utilisation rate or loss of key customers. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: At end-2016, HT Global's liquidity was adequate, with a proportionately consolidated cash balance of USD63 million with no short-term debt maturities. The group's only debt is the 7% USD300 million senior secured notes due in 2021. It also had USD42 million in the interest reserve account, which is classified as unrestricted cash to be used to pay for two years of interest on the senior notes. Hexaware is debt-free.

The central bank kept its benchmark interest rates steady on Friday, saying the current monetary policy was appropriate as it expected the economy to recover in the second half of the year. The spot rupee, which has been trading for the sixth straight session after being inactive for six weeks, traded at 153.25/35 per dollar at 0557 GMT, compared with Friday's close of 153.22/30. The markets were closed on Monday for the Id-ul-Fitr holiday. The spot rupee resumed trading on June 19 for the first time since May 5 when the central bank fixed its reference rate at 152.50.  The importer (dollar) demand is there today after the long weekend,  said a currency dealer, requesting anonymity. Dealers said they expect seasonal demand for the dollar to pick up from August. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank said it would allow gradual depreciation of the currency and set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year, mainly to meet a target set by the International Monetary Fund for a three-year $1.5 billion loan.  If, as we expect, the Fed tightens monetary policy more aggressively than the market expects over the coming months, there is a risk that this could lead to further falls in the (rupee) currency against the U.S. dollar,  Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.

He was just happy that when he finally got things right Monday night, so did they. Samardzija rebounded from three poor efforts against the Rockies with a solid outing, helping the Giants snap a five-game losing streak with a 9-2 victory in the opener of a three-game series. Hunter Pence and Buster Posey had three hits apiece in a 14-hit attack as the Giants, coming off a three-game home thumping at the hands of the New York Mets, won for just the second time in their past 14 games.  We haven't forgotten how to hit,  Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford said.  We know what we're capable of. It's been a while since we all came together in the same game.  Just their second loss in 12 games against the Giants in 2017 extended the Rockies' season-worst losing streak to six games. Colorado had beaten San Francisco nine straight times. Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at GiantsColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatch Just a lot of not good,  Rockies left fielder Ian Desmond said.  Just seems like things are going bad right now, but we'll turn it around.  Samardzija (3-9), who began the day as the losingest pitcher in the National League, limited the Rockies to two runs and six hits over 6 1/3 innings. He struck out five and did not walk a batter.  He's really thrown the ball well,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said of Samardzija, who hasn't allowed more than one walk in a game since April.  We've talked about his record and what it should be. It's nice to get him a win.  The veteran had been scorched by the Rockies for 19 runs and 26 hits over 18 1/3 innings in three earlier starts this season, taking a loss in all three. The Giants backed him with run support in five separate innings this time around.  That's the thing about this team,  Samardzija said.  You give it all you got because they're going to do the same.  Colorado starter German Marquez (5-4) allowed five runs and seven hits in four innings. He walked two and struck out two. Posey drove in three runs, and Joe Panik had two RBIs with a pair of singles for the Giants, whose 51 losses are tied with the Philadelphia Phillies for the most in baseball. Pence, Panik, Denard Span and Gorkys Hernandez scored twice apiece. Mark Reynolds and Tony Wolters each collected two hits for the Rockies, who were swept in a three-game series at Dodger Stadium over the weekend. The Rockies finished with nine hits off four Giants pitchers.  This is a team game,  Desmond said.  It's not pitching. It's not hitting. It's all of it.  Pitching's a lot easier when you have run support. And hitting's a lot easier when you have the pitchers shutting them down, having quick innings. It goes hand in hand. We just have to tighten it up as a team. Everybody.  The Giants built an early 5-0 lead on the strength of extra-base hits. Posey had an RBI double in the first inning, Brandon Belt a run-scoring triple in a two-run third and Span an RBI triple in a two-run fourth. NOTES: Responding to a Fox Sports report that RHP Mark Melancon's refusal to stretch with his fellow relievers almost four hours before night games, a  tradition  that began in 2012, had contributed to his club's poor season, Giants manager Bruce Bochy said before the game,  It's pole vaulting over mouse turds.  ... Discussion on the matter, including the report's use of unnamed sources within the organization, nonetheless prompted a team meeting about an hour before Monday's start. ... Rockies manager Bud Black announced RHP Kyle Freeland would start the Wednesday series finale, while RHP Antonio Senzatela will pitch out of the bullpen for the time being. Senzatela threw two scoreless innings in relief Monday. ... The Rockies placed RF Carlos Gonzalez (strained right shoulder) and LHP Tyler Anderson (inflamed left knee) on the 10-day disabled list. Colorado reinstated RHP Chad Qualls (back spasms) from the DL and promoted RHP Jairo Diaz from Triple-A Albuquerque. ... The Rockies had only three position players available on the bench, prompting Black to use Freeland as a pinch hitter in the fifth inning. Freeland struck out.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rockies-giants-writethru-idUSMTZED6R6Z760H"},

Volvo is owned by China's Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd . The Silicon Valley-based Nvidia also announced a non-exclusive partnership with German automotive suppliers ZF and Hella for artificial intelligence technology for autonomous driving. Nvidia came to prominence in the gaming industry for designing graphics processing chips, but in recent years has been a key player in the automotive sector for providing the so-called  brain  of the autonomous vehicle. The company, whose many partners already include Tesla Inc , Toyota Motor Corp and tier one supplier Robert Bosch, announced its latest deals at an automotive electronics show in Ludwigsburg, Germany. Nvidia's Drive PX artificial intelligence platform is used by Tesla in its Models S and X and upcoming Model 3 electric vehicles. Volkswagen AG's Audi is also using the system to reach full autonomous driving by 2020. In a call with reporters, Nvidia's senior automotive director Danny Shapiro said carmakers and their main suppliers are now moving away from the research and development phase of autonomous vehicles and into concrete production plans. The system developed jointly by ZF and Hella, and using Nvidia's Drive PX platform, will combine front cameras with radar and software to create technology meeting the Euro NCAP safety certification for so-called  Level 3  driving, in which some, but not all, driving is performed by the car. Volvo is already using the Drive PX for the self-driving cars in its  Drive Me  autonomous pilot program.

The group said it now expected its adjusted 2017 operating profit (EBIT) margin to be 11 to 12 percent, compared with previous guidance for 12 to 13 percent. Earnings in the second quarter, which ends on Friday, were substantially lower than a year earlier due to rising pricing pressures in the automotive business, growing costs for new product launches and higher research and development costs for electric car technology, Schaeffler said. It added that it had suffered a temporary supply chain shortage in the automotive aftermarket business, without providing details. It cut its forecast for free cash flow for 2017 to around 500 million euros from about 600 million, but stuck with an aim for 4 to 5 percent revenue growth excluding currency effects.

Lowden,Xi Jinping's ","sector":"Markets","content":"(Repeats report without changes) * Western banks wary of FLNG projects * But well-capitalised Chinese players step up lending * China aims to become lowest-cost seller of FLNG plants * Its shipyards to build floating plants for African projects By Oleg Vukmanovic  and Colin Leopold LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - China plans to pour almost $7 billion into floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) projects in Africa, betting on a largely untested technology in the hope that energy markets will recover by the time they start production in the early 2020s. Western banks are wary due to the depressed state of the shipping and gas markets, as well as the technical difficulties of pumping gas extracted from below the ocean floor, chilling it into liquid form on a floating platform and transferring it into tankers for export. China, however, is making a strategic push into FLNG, aiming to become the lowest cost seller of the complex floating plants and lead the global rollout of a technique that remains in its infancy, with only one project in commercial production so far. The country needs gas as a cleaner alternative to coal under a drive to improve air quality in its cities, and has already lent $12 billion to Russia's conventional Yamal LNG project in the Arctic as U.S. sanctions scared away Western banks. It has also lent or committed almost $4 billion to three FLNG schemes off the African coast. In two more African projects costing a total of $3 billion, it plans not only to provide the funding, but also build the production platforms.  We see a real commitment to FLNG in China both from the construction side and from the LNG consumption side where decreasing costs mean potentially lower cost LNG,  said Steve Lowden, chairman of Jersey-based NewAge which is planning FLNG projects off Congo Republic and Cameroon. China already dominates the global market for solar panels and is a major supplier of coal-fired power plants, aided by easy money, cheaper labour and state support. Now, with Beijing pushing President Xi Jinping's  Belt and Road  vision of expanding trade links between Asia, Africa and Europe, it is turning to FLNG to bring high technology work to its shipyards and create jobs - a strategic priority. FLNG is also attractive to resource-rich but debt-burdened African countries. Projects can sail into place, drop anchor, and begin exporting for much less than the cost of onshore plants, the price of which quadrupled in the decade to 2013. That, at least, is the theory. The reality is that the technology remains complex. Royal Dutch Shell's mammoth Prelude FLNG plant, for example will be aboard the world's biggest floating structure, but must squeeze the equipment into a quarter of the space occupied by an LNG plant on dry land. Wave motion and ocean currents add to the difficulties. The $12.6 billion Prelude project, which is due to start operating off Australia in 2018, is typical of those conceived during the era of high energy prices. However, spot LNG prices have fallen 70 percent since early 2014 and are expected to remain under pressure or drop further due to extra supply from new conventional plants in Australia and the United States. Despite this, some producers and buyers are banking on the glut ending early in the next decade, although they don't want to lock themselves into big projects, preferring smaller, more flexible ones like in Africa. The only operational FLNG project launched in Malaysia last year, with construction of the floating platform costing around $1.6-$1.7 billion. Bankers say this is still too expensive and if the Chinese can build one for $1 billion, they would corner the market. Established Shipyards With new investments in costly conventional LNG plants on hold, the only two production projects to advance this year are floating types, in Mozambique and Equatorial Guinea. Both are largely backed by Chinese loans although the platforms are being built by more established Asian shipyards. Lowden said the two NewAge projects will be wholly financed by Chinese companies and this time also built in Chinese shipyards.  They are more than fully able to handle such projects,  he said. Still, Dutch offshore engineer SBM and JGC of Japan will partner with the Chinese players, including China Offshore Oil Engineering & Construction Ltd. NewAge expects to sanction both the projects next year. Last year, China's Wison Offshore & Marine completed the first-ever FLNG ship but it remains unused following the cancellation of a project in Colombia it was intended for. Very Deep Pockets As typical Western sources of funding have slowed due to the weak state of the shipping business, highly-capitalised Chinese players believe the market has reached the bottom and are keen to step up lending before the cycle turns and pushes up costs.  The difference is that in the West banks lend at the top of the market when they have most liquidity, but in China they're smarter and put money in at the bottom,  a financier who advises Chinese lenders on LNG shipping deals said. This month, Chinese banks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Bank of China committed around 1.75 billion to project finance the Coral South FLNG project in Mozambique, bankers said. ICBC declined comment while BOC did not respond to a request for comment. By contrast Western commercial banks provided just $200 million in uncovered debt to Coral, to be developed by Italy's Eni, instead of an originally proposed $1.9 billion. They cited uncertainties around FLNG technology and a public debt crisis in Mozambique. Adam Byrne, Managing Director at ING Bank, said Chinese lenders  have very deep pockets indeed .  If they decide to, they can support something for even a billion or a billion and a half dollars,  Byrne told a shipping conference earlier this month. Africa and Beyond The next big African deal, in Equatorial Guinea, is being financed by China State Shipbuilding Corp with a $1.2 billion loan for Fortuna FLNG, bankers say. This project - which is being developed by UK-listed Ophir Energy, shipping firm Golar LNG and oil services group Schlumberger - will produce 2.2 million tonnes of LNG a year and is expected to be sanctioned within weeks. China State Shipbuilding Corp (CSSC) also lent $960 million to Golar LNG in 2015 for the first-ever conversion of a conventional LNG tanker into an FLNG platform, which is set to enter operation this year in Cameroon. CSSC declined comment. All these projects were awarded to established shipbuilders in South Korea, Singapore or Japan, but the experience sets up Chinese developers to take the lead on other projects in Africa and beyond, say consultants and industry sources. Equatorial Guinea sees scope for another two FLNG projects, its petroleum minister has said, while BP and joint venture partner Kosmos Energy are also eyeing two in the waters of Senegal and Mauritania. China also has plans for conventional LNG production in Africa. Chinese conglomerate Poly-GCL has begun construction of an onshore LNG facility in Djibouti which will export Ethiopian gas to China, according to Poly-GCL's website.

Financial market bubbles should be enough. The Bank for International Settlements, often considered the central bank to the world's central banks, warned on Sunday that policymakers should press ahead with the  great unwinding  of post-crisis stimulus, even if  some short-term bumps in the road  are inevitable. Inflation shouldn't be the  be all and end all  of monetary policy, according to BIS head of research Hyun Shin. Instead,  a bit more emphasis  should be put on financial developments such as the rise in credit growth and the potential economic costs of bubbles bursting. Shin and his colleagues should be listened to. The BIS was one of the few institutions warning that the credit bubble being inflated by the Alan Greenspan Fed's super-lax policy in the mid-2000s would burst with disastrous consequences. But even after the financial crisis plunged the world into recession and scarily close to another Great Depression, inflation is still the  be all and end all  for central banks across the developed world. Parallels between now and then are emerging. Inflation in the industrialised world is now broadly where it was a decade ago: extremely well contained and below most central banks' 2 percent target. Against a backdrop of anemic wage growth and oil slumping 20 percent in the last two months, there's little sign of it accelerating any time soon. In that light, the subtle but notable shift among major central banks recently towards policy  normalisation  is unwarranted. But while inflation poses no threat, the same cannot be said with any surety about financial markets. The warning signs are there: world stocks are the highest on record, volatility is the lowest in decades, and in credit, emerging market and high yield spreads are the narrowest in years. Despite the Fed raising rates, U.S. financial conditions are the easiest in over two years, according to Goldman Sachs. Credit growth and global debt are now higher than they were before the crisis. Bubbles are forming in equity and other markets, inflated by global central bank stimulus which is still running at nearly $200 billion a month. Reflecting investors' hunt for yield, Argentina last week issued a 100-year bond at a yield of less than 8 percent. Argentina has defaulted at least eight times since gaining independence in 1816 and has been in a state of default more than half of all days since 1980. Yet investors snapped it up. As Citi's Matt King notes, markets remain  in thrall to central banks . Grin and Bear It This is why tighter policy globally could be potentially seismic for markets. Investors have grown fat and happy on more than two decades of policymakers targeting inflation at 2 percent and offering the implicit insurance policy of the central bank  put . That's the belief that central banks will do whatever it takes to avoid the financial and economic damage a crash would unleash. Essentially that means maintaining a loose monetary policy and the flow of liquidity into financial assets. Last week Bill Dudley, president of the New York Fed, and Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, jolted markets by signaling their readiness to raise rates. The Fed has already raised rates four times and is about to reduce its balance sheet, and the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada to varying degrees have made it clear that the post-crisis stimulus should soon be gradually withdrawn. The arguments against using monetary policy to curb financial market excesses are well-known, powerful, and held by most of the world's central banking elite over the past quarter century. It's too blunt a tool, the concept of financial stability is too vague, it's impossible to accurately identify asset bubbles, the economic and financial fallout from pricking these bubbles is unknowable at best and catastrophic at worst. Ultimately it's not the business of central banks to be micro-managing markets. It's not their remit. Central bankers including Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Mervyn King, Lars Svensson and Jens Weidmann have argued that monetary authorities should resist leaning against the wind and trying to control or even prevent incipient financial booms. But in recent years the Fed has acknowledged the risks posed by ultra-low volatility and increased risk-taking. In 2014 Janet Yellen said high yield, or  junk  bonds were on the Fed's radar, warning that a sharp unwind of risk-taking behaviour in general would be something to avoid. A major shakeout in U.S. high yield bonds followed and yields jumped to 10 percent in early 2016. But they're now back to historic lows around 5.5 percent, the recovery coinciding almost exactly with the most gradual Fed tightening cycle in history. This shows that higher rates are failing to quell animal spirits. On this issue, Shin at the BIS and perma-bear Albert Edwards at Societe Generale agree that the longer bubbles are left to inflate, the greater the disaster when they pop. Edwards points out the irony in trying to reflate the economy through ultra-loose policy because bursting bubbles will take down the economy and probably deliver the very deflation policymakers were seeking to avoid in the first place.  Even after the (Great Financial Crisis) they simply have not learnt that loose money polices to blow asset price bubbles is a catastrophic policy destined to end in failure,  Edwards warns.

He has amazed that world, too, with his charm, his debate incisiveness and ideological creativity, plucking ideas and policies now from the left, now from the right.  It’s ruthlessness that has got him there. This week, he caused four ministers to leave his cabinet, three of whom were members of the closely allied MoDem party and one who had played a large part in building Macron’s own Republique en Marche. No talk of being innocent till proven guilty. All are being investigated for (relatively mild) corruption and it’s only a preliminary inquiry, but the accusation was enough to Bolstering the impression of Macron’s ruthlessness, the French media on Wednesday were full of anonymous quotes to the effect that he exercised tight control over ministers: “an outsized ego” who stops them governing, said the unnamed party sources.  Macron will need to be both ruthless and controlling. He now embarks on a twofold mission to succeed where his predecessors have failed, in a France seen as declining in its economy, its status and its optimism.  MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY Peter Apps: The dangers of putting Putin under pressure Josh Cohen: How Trump can show he’s tough on anti-Semitism That mission is, first, to revivify France, and second, to re-establish it as an equal partner with Germany in revivifying the European Union.   He’s beginning with France. Though his clean sweep of presidency and parliament has been impressive, he will be uneasily aware of a record low voter turnout in the June parliamentary elections and that holding the center means both left and right are against him.  He has already made clear that he wants to begin negotiations with the labor unions on injecting more flexibility into workplaces - easier firing, more hiring. In doing so he faces what one commentator has termed “the mother of all battles”  with organizations that have stymied change for decades. It will be a clash of different experiences and reflexes. Macron is young and educated at elite institutions, the unions are creatures of an industrial age in which job security and increasing wages were the start and finish of bargaining.  The European Union is a larger challenge, in part because he can control it less. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the undisputed but lonely leader of the EU, was visibly relieved by his election. She gushed immediately after his May win that Macron “carries the hopes of millions of French people and also of very many people in Germany and in the whole of Europe.”  However, Merkel faces a tough election on September 24 and must calibrate her response to him to avoid alienating her voters. “German support cannot replace French policy making,” she said drily after her enthusiastic welcome to Macron. I don’t see why - as a priority - we should change our policy.  The chancellor was saying that she would not consider the loosening of the fiscal rules on which Germany insists and of her government’s attitude that France and other “Club Med” countries must stop piling on debt that digs them deeper into an economic hole.  Then there’s Italy, which has succeeded Greece as the center of Europe’s concern. The third largest economy in the eurozone, Italy’s forecast growth rate of one percent this year lags behind the modest growth in the rest of the EU and does little for the country’s dangerously indebted economy and banking sector.  Opposition to the EU is growing in Italy, where an election is likely early next year, perhaps late this one. Although the populist euroskeptic Five Star Movement did badly in recent mayoral elections, it still tops the national  polls.     The never-to-be-discounted Silvio Berlusconi is also pledging to relaunch his Forza Italia party, while his allies on the right - the League and the Brothers of Italy - all reject pubic disaffection with the EU and could together beat the governing Democratic Party. An ailing, politically turbulent Italy poses a bigger danger to EU reform because, unlike Greece, the Italian economy is too big to save from default.  Macron must conquer these problems - along with the agonies of Brexit negotiations and the continued hostility of the central European members Poland, Hungary and Slovakia to much EU policy, especially on immigration -  if he is to join Merkel as chief engineer in the Union’s engine room. He has the wind behind him. But the opposing headwinds will be as strong.

The Swedish firm's clients in its core business include Vodafone and Verizon but profits have plunged due to competition from Nokia (NOKIA.HE) and China's Huawei [HWT.UL] and as telecoms companies make savings. Its shares have fallen 30 percent in two years. Ericsson said in 2014 it would diversify so that by 2020 up to 25 percent of revenue would come from industries beyond telecoms, such as media, utilities and transport, from an estimated 10 percent in 2013.  But the plan has not worked and the company will drop the target as new chief executive Borje Ekholm repositions to focus on the core business of mobile networks.   We will focus on telco clients and networks exclusively for now,  Ericsson's new head of Digital Services Ulf Ewaldsson told Reuters in a recent interview. The U-turn comes at a challenging time for Ekholm, who after only five months in the top job is being pressed by activist investor Cevian Capital, which has a $1 billion stake in the company, to make faster changes. Ekholm unveiled a cost-cutting plan in March and announced up to $1.7 billion in provisions, writedowns and restructuring costs. He said this would include exploring options for its loss-making media arm and turning its managed services business around. Investors welcomed the greater focus after years of disappointing investments from Ericsson, but they worry the new plan will not generate growth. Moody's cut the company's credit rating to junk in May, partly due to worries that the cost-cutting could hamper innovation.  Increasing dependence on telecoms operators could be risky as they are struggling to grow revenue due to fierce competition and so are unwilling to spend more on networks even as they prepare for 5G fifth-generation wireless broadband technology. Ericsson has to prove it can remain relevant in an industry that has gone from over 10 major players to three in 20 years. Investors question whether it can do this under Ekholm who has been on the board for a decade while Ericsson lost ground. Rivals Push Ahead Gear makers have long seen an opportunity to sell network equipment directly to corporate clients but have struggled because they lack the adequate sales network, telecom consultant Roman Friedrich of AlixPartners said. Instead of spending money trying to build its own sales channels, Ewaldsson told Reuters it will sell communication networks and IT services like cloud storage through the telecoms companies.  While Ericsson pulls back, arch-rivals Huawei and Nokia are forging ahead with corporate clients in the automotive, transport and energy sector. They are increasingly building in-house private communication networks, for example to strengthen security.  The Chinese and Finnish companies generate about 8 and 4 percent of their revenue, respectively, from corporate clients. Ericsson had been betting on media clients but is now exploring a sale of the unit. Losing Ground Ericsson sees opportunities to sell products to telecom clients which will need to upgrade their networks to address a greater flow of data enabled by 5G. It will also build additional capacity to connect objects around the world when  the Internet of Things becomes reality.  But Bengt Nordstrom, head of consultancy firm Northstream which advises telecom operators and vendors, said 5G will only help sustain existing revenues and won't bring additional ones in the foreseeable future.  Ericsson is also betting investments in automation and artificial intelligence will make its networks more efficient and boost profits for it and its clients, Ewaldsson said while declining to give more details on the plan.  Stock pickers and analysts were hoping for more details of Ekholm's cost-cutting plan to help explain how the company will reach its target of doubling 2016 margins after 2018. An obvious way is to shed loss-making businesses such as media operations, said analyst Richard Kramer of Arete Research.  But doing so will cut 10-15 percent of revenue, meaning absolute profits will shrink, he said.    Ericsson has already lost its position as market leader to Huawei in mobile infrastructure and SocGen analysts expect Nokia, which has expanded by merging with French rival Alcatel, will overtake it in services in two to three years. Ewaldsson said Ericsson was hoping to become the market leader again in radio base stations that send signals to connect devices to networks. Helping customers store and process data externally - cloud services - is another priority for Ericsson. But Kramer said its products lack an edge:  Ericsson simply lacks the products to sell to the likes of Google, Facebook, or Amazon, which are the biggest incremental spenders on infrastructure.   IT executives at four European telecoms companies told Reuters they increasingly look at cheaper Asian rivals, especially Huawei, while new software players are gaining market share through tailor-made solutions that undercut Ericsson's  one-fits-all  approach.  Ericsson is relying on its partner Cisco (CSCO.O) to plug a product gap in routers, but some clients say they find it easier dealing with a single supplier and therefore tend to favor Nokia or Huawei.

She is scheduled to take part in a discussion later on Tuesday at London's Royal Academy. A positive view despite a recent batch of weak U.S. economic data would support the Fed's forecast for another rise in policy rates this year.  Hedge funds are already selling yen this week, and positive comments from Yellen could give them an excuse to sell even more,  said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo. The dollar rose to 112.075 yen earlier on Tuesday, its highest level since May 24. It was last at 111.88 yen, up slightly on the day. U.S. data on Monday gave investors reason to be cautious about buying the dollar. New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter.  Even after the break of the 112 level, the dollar didn't show any strong upward momentum,  said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. After the weak data raised concerns about falling inflation and lacklustre growth, long-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields dropped to seven-month lows and the yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds narrowed to its flattest level since 2007. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were at 2.138 percent in Asian trading, little changed from a U.S. close on Monday of 2.137 percent. Fed officials have stuck to their hawkish scripts. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said in Sydney on Monday that a slowdown in U.S. inflation was mainly due to one-off factors and should not prevent further increases in interest rates. Financial conditions have loosened in the past year despite the Fed raising interest rates three times since December, which is another reason to continue tightening, New York Fed President William Dudley said in remarks published on Monday. The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.1188, moving up from its overnight low of $1.1172 reached after dovish comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, which contrasted sharply with those of Fed officials. In a town-hall with university students in Lisbon, Draghi said super low interest rates create jobs, foster growth and benefit borrowers. He rejected calls to exit super easy monetary policy quickly, arguing premature tightening would lead to a fresh recession and more inequality. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, inched 0.1 percent lower on the day to 97.367.

Roy Cimatu said he plans to visit mines in the world's top nickel ore supplier to see if they are operating responsibly as he takes a slow approach towards a sector that was the target of a 10-month crackdown led by the previous minister, Regina Lopez.  Cimatu, a former soldier, took over the environment ministry post on May 8, shortly after the dismissal of Lopez, who ordered the closure or suspension of 26 operating mines and revoked 75 mining contracts in what she said was a fight against  greedy miners  threatening public heath and nature.   Hopefully by next month we can come up with the decision on appeals regarding  the mining contracts, Cimatu told reporters at an industry forum.   I am going slowly about these issues on mining, I will concentrate first on the environment. But that does not mean mining isn't a priority. That's why I have plans to visit some mining companies.   Many of the miners affected by Lopez's orders filed appeals that have yet to be acted on with the office of President Rodrigo Duterte or the environment ministry. But the appeals effectively stayed Lopez's orders.  Shortly after he assumed the job, Cimatu told Reuters it was possible to strike a balance between mining and protecting natural resources, signaling his intent to settle a bitter dispute that has been one of the biggest economic conundrums of Duterte's presidency.  Since then, Cimatu has been careful in framing his stance towards mining. Earlier this month, he said he will  strictly enforce mining and environmental regulations, and mining operations found violating laws, rules and regulations shall be subject to penalties, suspensions and/or cancellation.  Global nickel prices have fallen nearly 20 percent from this year's peak after Lopez's dismissal raised the prospect of increased supply from the Philippines. Prices have also been pulled down by more mines in Indonesia being allowed to export ore.  Cimatu said among mines he will inspect next month are those in nickel-rich areas in the southern Mindanao region and in Palawan province.   I will go visit every mining company,  he said.     ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Reporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Writing by Manolo Serapio Jr.; Editing by Tom Hogue","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-mining-idUSKBN19I0GR"},

You can really never tell,  Montgomery said.  Sometimes, when you have your worst bullpens before a game, you have your best games. And you can have a great one, and you go out there and stink it up.  Against the Chicago White Sox, Montgomery did not stink -- even if his stuff was filthy. The rookie southpaw matched a career high with eight strikeouts, and the Yankees survived a turbulent ninth inning for a 6-5 win. New York (41-33) snapped a two-game skid and won for only the third time in the past 13 games. Montgomery (6-4) won his fourth consecutive decision thanks to a dominant slider and a dependable curveball. He limited Chicago to one run on five hits and a walk in seven innings. Of his 100 pitches, 67 were strikes.  I'm really happy with what he's doing,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  He's throwing the ball well. He usually gives us pretty good distance and continues to grow as a pitcher.  Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at White SoxNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchThe Yankees' bullpen nearly squandered Montgomery's big effort. The White Sox trailed 6-1 entering the ninth but rallied with four runs against left-handers Chasen Shreve and Aroldis Chapman. Chapman got Todd Frazier to fly out with the tying run on second base to end the game. He earned his eighth save of the season. Tim Anderson hit a three-run home run for the White Sox to try to spark the late comeback. Anderson finished 2-for-5 in the first game in which he wore corrective lenses at the plate.  I've been using them in (batting practice), trying to get used to them, and I'm going to continue to use them throughout the rest of the season,  Anderson said. Chase Headley finished 3-for-4 with a double, an RBI and a run to lead the Yankees at the plate. Tyler Austin belted a solo home run and notched two RBIs. The win did not come without cost for the Yankees. Second baseman Starlin Castro left the game because of a strained right hamstring that he sustained while running out a ground ball. Castro is scheduled to undergo an MRI exam on Tuesday. Girardi did not rule out a stint on the disabled list.  He felt it kind of tighten up, so he pulled up (running to first),  Girardi said.  We'll know more tomorrow.  Chicago (32-43) has lost four games in a row and seven of eight. White Sox left-hander David Holmberg (1-2) allowed six runs (two earned) on five hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked four and struck out two.  We fought really hard,  Holmberg said.  A couple of smaller innings, and we would have had a 'W.'  Chicago opened the scoring on a solo shot by Frazier to start the second. The former home run derby champion pulled a low fastball into the left field bleachers for his 13th long ball of the season. New York scored three runs in the fourth to pull ahead. Aaron Judge drew a leadoff walk and scored on a sacrifice fly by Austin. Headley hit an RBI single, and Jacoby Ellsbury scored on a sacrifice fly by Ronald Torreyes. Austin homered to increase the Yankees' lead to 4-1 in the sixth. Holmberg left a pitch over the plate, and Austin ripped a line drive over the left field wall for his first home run of the season. New York added two more runs later in the inning to make it 6-1. Girardi chuckled when asked about the mood in the dugout during Chicago's late rally.  In a game of baseball, there aren't too many easy wins,  he said. NOTES: Yankees OF Jacoby Ellsbury was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list after missing a month with a concussion. He batted sixth and went 1-for-5. ... The White Sox recalled RHP Juan Minaya from Triple-A Charlotte and optioned RHP Gregory Infante to Triple-A. ... Yankees OF Aaron Hicks was placed on the 10-day disabled list because of a right oblique strain. New York recalled INF/OF Rob Refsnyder and RHP Ronald Herrera from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. They replaced OF Mason Williams and LHP Tyler Webb, who were optioned to Triple-A. ... White Sox first-round draft pick Jake Burger threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

Roy Cimatu said he plans to visit mines in the world's top nickel ore supplier to see if they are operating responsibly as he takes a slow approach towards a sector that was the target of a 10-month crackdown led by the previous minister, Regina Lopez.  Cimatu, a former soldier, took over the environment ministry post on May 8, shortly after the dismissal of Lopez, who ordered the closure or suspension of 26 operating mines and revoked 75 mining contracts in what she said was a fight against  greedy miners  threatening public heath and nature.   Hopefully by next month we can come up with the decision on appeals regarding  the mining contracts, Cimatu told reporters at an industry forum.   I am going slowly about these issues on mining, I will concentrate first on the environment. But that does not mean mining isn't a priority. That's why I have plans to visit some mining companies.   Many of the miners affected by Lopez's orders filed appeals that have yet to be acted on with the office of President Rodrigo Duterte or the environment ministry. But the appeals effectively stayed Lopez's orders.  Shortly after he assumed the job, Cimatu told Reuters it was possible to strike a balance between mining and protecting natural resources, signaling his intent to settle a bitter dispute that has been one of the biggest economic conundrums of Duterte's presidency.  Since then, Cimatu has been careful in framing his stance towards mining. Earlier this month, he said he will  strictly enforce mining and environmental regulations, and mining operations found violating laws, rules and regulations shall be subject to penalties, suspensions and/or cancellation.  Global nickel prices have fallen nearly 20 percent from this year's peak after Lopez's dismissal raised the prospect of increased supply from the Philippines. Prices have also been pulled down by more mines in Indonesia being allowed to export ore.  Cimatu said among mines he will inspect next month are those in nickel-rich areas in the southern Mindanao region and in Palawan province.   I will go visit every mining company,  he said.     ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Reporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Writing by Manolo Serapio Jr.; Editing by Tom Hogue","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/philippines-mining-idUSL3N1JO1U9"},

On the deck of Thunder Horse, they work two-week shifts, drink seawater from a desalination plant, and eat ribs and chicken ferried in by boat. On the ocean floor, robots provide remote eyes and arms as drills extract up to 265,000 barrels per day.  There's a whole city below us,  said Jim Pearl, Marine Team Leader on the platform. This is just one of the four Gulf of Mexico platforms on which BP has staked its future in U.S. oil production. Seven years after its Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, BP is betting tens of billions of dollars on the prospect that it can slash the costs of offshore drilling by half or more - just as shale oil producers have done onshore. The firm says it can do that while it continues to pay an estimated $61 billion in total costs and damages from the worst spill in history - and without compromising safety. BP's Gulf platforms are key to a global strategy calling for up to $17 billion in annual investments through 2021 to increase production by about 5 percent each year, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley recently told investors.  Our strategy is to take this investment that we spent so much money building, and keep it full  to the platform's capacity, Richard Morrison, BP's regional president for the Gulf of Mexico, told Reuters during the first tour of a BP Gulf drilling platform since the disaster.  We're also exploring for larger pools of oil.  BP's deepwater double-down is all the more striking for the contrast to its chief competitors, who have cooled on offshore investments in light of the lower costs and quicker returns of onshore shale plays. While BP has some onshore U.S. developments, the firm is notably absent from the industry's rush into shale oil fields of the West Texas Permian Basin. Majors including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) have maintained Gulf operations but focused expansions on U.S. shale. Exxon Mobil doubled its acreage in the Permian in a deal earlier this year. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N) and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) have pulled out of Gulf drilling entirely in recent years. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) took a $435-million dollar write-down in May on its Shenandoah project in the Gulf, deciding it could not profit with oil prices hovering at about $50 a barrel.  In a $50 to $60 world, we always felt like greenfield development, in the Gulf in particular, was fairly challenged,  Anadarko CEO Al Walker told investors last month. Oil prices dropped steeply last week, settling in the low $40s per barrel. BP says its next Gulf development - the $9 billion Mad Dog phase two - would be profitable even at $40 a barrel. As recently as 2013, BP reported that it could not start new deepwater Gulf projects at prices lower than $100 a barrel. A Billion Barrels In time, BP's offshore expansion could produce a huge payoff. The firm announced last month that it had discovered an additional billion barrels of oil below its four audaciously named Gulf platforms - Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Na Kika and Mad Dog. The find - worth more than $40 billion at today's market prices - amounts to more than three times the proven reserves at the Na Kika field, or the equivalent of three new fields in the Gulf.  It seems like every ten years there's another breakthrough  that unlocks more Gulf oil, Morrison said on the deck of Thunder Horse. Over his shoulder, a drillship three miles away tapped a new well that will feed production into the massive platform. In the wake of the 2010 BP disaster, deepwater production was curtailed by a six-month U.S. government moratorium on drilling and a longer period of uncertainty about regulation. But output has rebounded to new record highs as projects sanctioned years ago start operations and existing hubs such as Thunder Horse expand. Representative Steve Scalise (R-LA) views BP's Thunder Horse Oil Platform in the Gulf of Mexico, from the air, 150 miles from the Louisiana coast in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters June 26, 2017.   Chris Bond/Handout via REUTERSBP's big new discovery is key to its slashing of estimated per-barrel costs, as are a host of drilling innovations and more favorable deals with service providers. For eight decades, geologists have used seismic imaging to estimate oil and gas reserves beneath the rocky undersea terrain. BP used its own new technology for the billion-barrel discovery. Called full waveform inversion, the technique uses massive amounts of data to create a high-resolution model of reserves that were previously hidden beneath salt deposits. The firm also aims to tap those reserves without building new multi-billion-dollar platforms. At Thunder Horse and other platforms, BP is installing wellheads on the seabed and connecting them to pipelines that rise up to existing platforms, like the legs of a spider. These  tiebacks  allow producers to feed oil from remote regions of fields that previously went untapped. Other design changes helped BP hold down the investment in Mad Dog's second phase from an initially estimated $20 billion to just $9 billion, the company said. Such savings are part of the equation BP uses to estimate the platform's profitability at oil prices of $40 a barrel.  Slideshow (5 Images)The struggles of deepwater oil service firms - who were forced to cut prices after per-barrel prices tanked in 2014 - are also keeping BP's expansion costs low.  If you're going to be building an offshore Gulf of Mexico platform, now is the time to be doing it,  said Norm MacDonald, portfolio manager for Invesco's energy fund, which has increased its stake in BP, its second-largest holding. Other funds remain leery of offshore investments because of the longer wait for a return in a volatile industry. Shale has a  liquidity premium  because producers can make smaller investments and recoup them sooner, within two or three years, said Michael Roomberg, a portfolio analyst at Miller-Howard Investments. Tie-backs and other advances, however, could accelerate deepwater returns and help narrow the liquidity gap with shale, MacDonald said.  Cost Cutting, Safety Concerns BP's growing deepwater investments irk some environmentalists, who say the company has fought paying what it owes to restore shorelines and communities damaged by its massive spill. They also see the threat of another disaster.  They never really fulfilled those promises, and people are very skeptical about them expanding drilling,  said Raleigh Hoke, campaign director at Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans. Richard Sears - who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling - said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices.  The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision-making and slipshod safety systems than cost-cutting, said Sears, who previously managed production projects at Shell. BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill, introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices, among other measures. The company says it cannot precisely estimate new spending on safety since the spill because its efforts are integrated into many parts of the company. In a glassed-in drilling shack on the Thunder Horse platform, operators stay connected to a new onshore command center in Houston that BP designed to monitor data from offshore wells. On the deck below sits a blowout preventer, a room-sized piece of equipment that would soon be fitted on the wellhead of a drilling site, two miles under water.  But first it would need a safety inspection - unlike the blowout preventer that infamously failed to contain the 2010 spill, which federal regulators have said had not been inspected in years.

But a company known for engineering excellence is still trying to solve the very human problem of how to organize itself. Nearly two years ago, Google co-founder Larry Page announced the tech giant would be remade as Alphabet, a holding company whose units would include Google and an array of unrelated pursuits in areas such as healthcare, self-driving cars and urban planning. Wall Street cheered. Previously those riskier ventures had been lumped into Google's overall financial results. Investors would now see Google’s performance independent of its so-called “Other Bets,” an eclectic collection of 11 ventures. They include Nest, a maker of Wi-Fi enabled thermostats; Calico, which seeks to prolong the human lifespan; and X, the company's secretive research lab. Alphabet's top management also aimed to boost accountability by appointing chief executives to head each of the Other Bets. Few people in Google's constellation of ventures had ever held the title prior to that. But so far Alphabet has failed to show it can convert its Other Bets from experiments to businesses with the reach, impact and money-making potential of Google’s core search and advertising operations. Interviews with two dozen former Alphabet executives and employees reveal an organization grappling with how much time and resources Other Bets deserve in the pursuit of profitability. In the first quarter, which ended March 31, the ventures lost a combined $855 million; that's on top of a collective $3.6 billion loss for 2016. As a whole, Alphabet generated $90.3 billion in revenue in 2016. Google's share of that revenue was $89.5 billion, while its 2016 operating income was $27.9 billion. Alphabet's early days have seen more pruning than expansion of its holdings. The company has skinned back plans for Google Fiber, which delivers rapid Internet service in 10 metro areas. This month, Alphabet agreed to sell robotics company Boston Dynamics to Japanese multinational SoftBank Group Corp. It unloaded its Terra Bella satellite imaging business in February. At one point last year, it was even looking to sell Nest, the largest of the Other Bets, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Google paid an eye-popping $3.2 billion for the start-up in 2014.  (For a graphic showing Alphabet's holdings, see: tmsnrt.rs/2rNgdKN) Meanwhile, a series of executives have departed since the reorganization, including the heads of Nest, an Internet operation called Access and a venture capital firm known as GV. An Alphabet spokeswoman declined repeated requests for comment or to make executives available for interviews. Supporters of the restructuring frame the early struggles as typical growing pains. For now, Wall Street isn't worried: Alphabet's stock is near an all-time high, having reached $1,000 per share in June. Ruth Porat, the no-nonsense chief financial officer who has steered the restructuring, has won rave reviews from investors for enforcing financial accountability across Alphabet. Some Other Bets have made notable strides. Life sciences initiative Verily recently attracted $800 million in outside investment. Self-driving car project Waymo is considered among the leaders in the burgeoning industry. Still, it's not yet clear the structure will enable Alphabet to do what most companies cannot: conceive the next wave of innovation in-house or through the development of key acquisitions. That goal is central to both the company's mission and investor expectations, analysts say. “The reason Google gets to trade at a decent multiple… is because there's a growth story beyond advertising,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. CEO or COO? The Alphabet structure is Google’s stab at an age-old corporate conundrum: sustaining innovation within a giant enterprise. Alphabet's strategy is to give entrepreneurs the autonomy of a startup, coupled with the discipline of a traditional corporate structure. Roughly once a quarter, Other Bets leaders meet with the Alphabet board – comprised of Porat, Page, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and David Drummond, Alphabet's senior vice president of corporate development – to discuss funding and performance, according to two former employees. At the same time, Alphabet is establishing separate compensation plans for the Other Bets to reward employees if their ventures succeed, mirroring startup incentives. Attendees wait for a Google presentation in San Francisco, October 2016.Beck DiefenbachThe formula has primed Alphabet's emerging businesses for  global impact,  Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said this month at the annual stockholders meeting at the Mountain View headquarters.  There is one solution that we know works well in capitalism, which is boards, shareholders, CEOs,  Schmidt said.  My bet is that the traditional lessons of business organization will in fact result in success at Alphabet.  Still, Alphabet top brass continue to hold sway over key strategy and financing decisions, a dynamic that has chafed Other Bets chief executives who've complained they are treated more like chief operating officers than shot callers, according to people familiar with the situation. In addition, scrutiny from Wall Street limits how generous Alphabet can be in extending Google's resources to Other Bets, said Brian McClendon, a former vice president of engineering at Google.  As of yet, the restructuring hasn’t provided what I think is one of the immediate benefits, which is risk-taking investment,  he said. Nickeled and Dimed Some companies acquired by Google found that being part of Alphabet wasn't what they'd bargained for. Two former Nest employees said they were promised generous funding and time to achieve profitability following the company's acquisition by Google in 2014. But after the restructuring, Alphabet executives were keenly focused on revenue, one former employee said. Pricey overhead has made the path to profitability tougher. After the restructuring, Alphabet began charging Other Bets for their portion of shared services such as security and facilities, ending what had previously amounted to a subsidy, people familiar with the situation said. The units also felt pressure to maintain Google perks such as free employee meals.  “One of the pitfalls (of Alphabet) is that those companies are asked to stand on their own two feet, but they may inherit the cost structure of Google,  said Nest investor Peter Nieh, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. In early 2016, Alphabet explored selling Nest in an effort code-named Project Amalfi, according to three people familiar with the matter. No deal materialized, and Nest co-founder Tony Fadell departed last year. Fadell declined to comment. Boston Dynamics, acquired in 2013 during a robotics shopping spree led by Android creator Andy Rubin, enjoyed generous funding at first. But it was adrift after Rubin's departure, two former employees said. Rubin did not respond to requests for comment. Grumpy Googlers The creation of the Other Bets has also changed what it means to work for Google. Some grumble that their role now is to subsidize innovation at their sister companies, rather than to innovate themselves. “It did sort of send the message to people who stayed back at Google, whether in search or in ads: Your job isn’t to push the envelope,” one former Googler said. Employee transfers to X, the illustrious “moonshot factory,” are more complicated now that it's a separate entity, former employees say. That’s a striking shift, especially for high-performing employees accustomed to moving about the company almost at will, said Punit Soni, a former Google employee who is now chief executive of Learning Motors, an artificial intelligence startup. “A basic premise of Google was people could do whatever they wanted,” Soni said. “I can see why people will feel like it’s no longer the old Google.  In the meantime, co-founder Page is pursuing yet another  moonshot : flying cars.  He is the primary investor in Kitty Hawk, a startup in the field that is entirely outside the Alphabet umbrella.

A month-and-a-half after winning a snap election, Moon is still trying to form his cabinet. Whoever fills the justice minister's post will have a key role overseeing Moon's promise of legal reforms following the impeachment of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, over a corruption scandal. Moon has vowed to reform the country's prosecutors' office by making it more independent from politics. His nomination of Park Sang-ki, a legal scholar, came 11 days after the earlier candidate, Ahn Kyong-whan, withdrew over controversies that when he was a young man he had forged the seal of a woman he was dating on a marriage license application. Nominees for cabinet posts appear before parliamentary panels, which routinely scrutinize their ethics, though their appointment does not require parliamentary approval. Several of Moon's picks, including the defense and unification ministers, have yet to be formally appointed, even as the country faces the challenge of stopping North Korea's defiant pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Moon travels to Washington on Wednesday for a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, which is expected to focus on reaffirming their countries' alliance and how best to respond to the North's weapons program.

The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.2 percent, to 3,659.35 points by the lunch break, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.1 percent, to 3,182.66 points. Investors largely looked past news that profits at China's industrial companies surged 16.7 percent in May from a year earlier, accelerating from April and defying expectations of a slowdown. With the CSI300 trading near the highest level since early 2016, some investors aren't sure if the index could run up much further amid signs Beijing will continue to keep liquidity conditions relatively tight. Citing  relatively high  liquidity levels in the banking stem, China's central bank on Tuesday skipped open market operations for the third consecutive day, as short-term borrowing rates eased recently.  The central bank doesn't want the market to form expectations of loose liquidity,  Wang Gang, strategist at Huajin Securities, wrote.  In the future, liquidly will remain relatively tight. Under such a backdrop ... there's limited room for blue-chips to rise further.  Wang said investors were also bracing for the mid-year earning season, which starts next week, to reassess their portfolios. Most sectors fell, led by real estate stocks, which took a breather and dropped 1.4 percent after jumping nearly 9 percent during the previous two sessions. Hong Kong Hong Kong's benchmark indexes were little changed. The Hang Seng index added 0.1 percent, to 25,894.55 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 0.2 percent, to 10,508.37.

The acrobatic Cubs shortstop fanned in his first three at-bats against Washington starter Gio Gonzalez. However, Baez singled in the eighth inning and had an RBI double in the ninth as Chicago held on for a 5-4 win on Monday night despite four runs in the bottom of the ninth by the Nationals.  I have been working and working. Finally, it is paying off,  said Baez, who has hit safely in eight games in a row and is 13-for-31 (.419) during that stretch. Baez also made several nice defensive plays, robbing Bryce Harper of a single and making a diving catch in foul territory in the eighth. The winning pitcher was Eddie Butler, a Virginia native who was playing in front of his mother, brother and a college teammate from Radford University.  We had a really good game plan,  said Butler, who threw five scoreless innings.  Javy was making plays all over the field. The guys were making great plays to keep us in that situation (with the lead). It was intense. Sometimes I felt myself speed up a little bit.  After slicing a five-run deficit to one in the ninth, the Nationals had two runners on base before Ryan Zimmerman fanned against closer Wade Davis to end the game. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at NationalsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatch Well, you know, I mean, as long you got outs, you got a chance, that's how I look at it,  Nationals manager Dusty Baker said.  Especially with the offense we have, you don't know when and who they're going to erupt against.  The fact that we had action on winning that game, we were a hit away from winning that game, and our guys didn't quit. It was a great comeback, and you never know in the eighth which run is going to beat you. It was tough to take and especially when we had a chance to come back -- and a chance to come back all the way.  Willson Contreras led off the game with a homer for the Cubs. Butler (4-2) was lifted for pinch hitter Addison Russell in the top of the sixth. Russell struck out with two runners on base to end the inning with the Cubs ahead 1-0. Chicago reliever Carl Edwards Jr. fanned all three batters he faced in the sixth. Pedro Strop threw a scoreless seventh. Koji Uehara, Brian Duensing and Justin Grimm handled the eighth, and Hector Rondon and Davis pitched the ninth, the latter two allowing two runs apiece.  Unique the way it played out,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  Javy had a wonderful game all the way around.  Chicago got an insurance run in the eighth when the Washington defense fell apart, and the Cubs added three runs in the ninth. Jeimer Candelario reached on a fielder's choice in the eighth when Washington second baseman Daniel Murphy was late with a relay throw on the lead runner at second. Baez, ruled safe on the video review, then stole third and scored on a squeeze bunt by Albert Almora Jr. to give the Cubs a 2-0 lead. Anthony Rizzo and Ian Happ had RBI singles in the ninth against Matt Grace, and Baez (two hits) hit an RBI double for a 5-0 cushion. Matt Wieters (two hits) had an RBI single in the ninth for Washington, and Stephen Drew added a two-run double to make it 5-3. Wilmer Difo scored on a wild pitch to make it 5-4. Gonzalez (7-2) gave up one run and two hits in six innings. He walked five and fanned eight. The Cubs (39-37) are 17-21 on the road, while the Nationals (45-31) are 20-16 at home. Contreras also had two hits for the Cubs, and Harper had three hits and Michael A. Taylor two for the Nationals. Contreras gave the Cubs the lead with a leadoff homer in the first inning. It was the first time he batted leadoff at any level of pro ball. Baez made a highlight-reel catch at short as he speared a line drive off the bat of Harper to end the third inning. Harper singled in the first after he had walked 13 times in a four-game series against the Cubs in May 2016.  Every hitter was battling,  Baker said.  We got a big pinch-hit from Drew; nobody wanted to make the last out, and they made some outstanding defensive plays against us and especially Javy made a couple outstanding plays.  We did make a couple plays that cost us some runs. We've got to tighten up our defense like I told you the other day, because making an error or two a game is not going to really get it.  NOTES: Cubs 3B Jeimer Candelario (1-for-4) was called up from Triple-A Iowa to start. To make room on the roster, RHP Dylan Floro was sent to Iowa. ... Cubs INF Addison Russell was not in the starting lineup, a day after he left the game in Miami with a sore shoulder. On Monday, he exited after fanning as a pinch hitter in the sixth inning. ... Washington LF Jayson Werth, who has been on the disabled list since June 5 with a left foot contusion, may not return until after the All-Star break, according to manager Dusty Baker.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-nationals-writethru-idUSMTZED6R6S7KVX"},

The S&P;/ASX 200 index which had gained for the past three days, dropped 0.3 percent or 17.06 points to 5,703.10 by 0327 GMT. The benchmark ended 0.1 percent higher on Monday. Janet Yellen, appearing at an interview-style event at London's Royal Academy later today, is expected to stick to her positive views on the U.S. economy despite some recent weak U.S. economic indicators, supporting the Fed's forecast of raising interest rates once more this year.  The markets are pretty comfortable with what Yellen is likely to talk about, said Chris Weston, an institutional dealer with IG Markets.  She will probably lean on the more dovish side of things.  Real estate stocks were a drag on the index with retirement community developer Aveo Group falling as much as 5.5 percent to slump to a near two-year low. Meanwhile, weaker gold and copper prices pushed the materials sector down. BHP Billiton Ltd fell 1.1 percent while Rio Tinto Ltd dropped nearly 1 percent. Retailer Metcash Ltd and Blackmores Ltd were the biggest percentage losers on the benchmark shedding 3.7 percent and 3.8 percent respectively. Vitamin maker Blackmores announced on Tuesday the retirement of Chief Executive and Managing Director Christine Holgate. The broad-based losses were slightly offset by gains in three of the 'Big-Four' lenders. Westpac Banking Corp rose 0.1 percent, Commonwealth Bank of Australia gained 0.5 percent and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd was up 0.6 percent while National Australia Bank Ltd shed 0.2 percent.  Its only financials that are finding any kind of support in the market today, there's no real catalyst to move markets at the moment,  Weston added. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the market-leading mortgage lender, hiked interest-only home loan rates on Tuesday following its three main rivals as regulators fret over financial stability risks amid rising housing prices and record-high household debt. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index rose 0.5 percent or 36.92 points to 7,632.42. Telecom and industrial stocks lifted the index although losses in utilities limited gains. Spark New Zealand Ltd climbed as much as 1.6 percent to its highest in 10 months while Auckland International Airport Ltd rose 0.5 percent, extending its gains to a fifth session. Scales Corporation Ltd and Xero Ltd were among the biggest percentage losers, falling 2.6 percent and 1 percent respectively.

The company, which currently has about 6 million bikes, also aims to break even by the end of the year, Chief Executive Dai Wei said.  Our profitability is, in fact, very strong,  he told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Dalian. More than a dozen Chinese bike-sharing firms have cropped up since the beginning of 2016. Ofo and rival Mobike have emerged as front-runners with valuations exceeding $1 billion. Ofo raised $450 million in a March D round from investors including DST Global, ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing and CITIC's private equity arm. Dai said in April that the firm was valued at upwards of $2 billion. Mobike raised $600 million in an E series round last week, taking their total funding since January to over $1 billion, which will be used to help expand, including into new markets such as Singapore, Japan and the UK.

Geng Shuang, a spokesman with China's foreign ministry, said Indian guards  obstructed normal activities  by Chinese forces on the border and called on India to withdraw immediately, according to a ministry statement late on Monday. He urged India to respect China's territorial integrity and the border treaties signed by the two countries, and said China had already suspended official pilgrimages at the Nathu La Pass, which lies on the frontier between Sikkim state and Tibet. A spokesman for the Indian Army declined to comment but said the army would issue a statement on Tuesday. India's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nathu La connects India to Hindu and Buddhist sites in the region and was the site of a fierce border clash between Chinese and Indian troops in 1967. China's Defence Ministry said in a separate statement India's military had obstructed work on a road, a move it described as seriously threatening peace on the border.  China is dedicated to developing bilateral relations, and will staunchly defend its legitimate rights,  it said.  China hopes India will meet it halfway, not do anything to complicate the border issues and jointly maintain the good momentum of relations,  the defence ministry said. Ties between China and India have long been frosty as a result of long-term territorial disputes, as well as Beijing's support of Pakistan, and Indian leaders declined to attend China's  Belt and Road  summit aimed at boosting regional economic and political ties last month. Chinese President Xi Jinping told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month that the two countries should work to  appropriately  manage their differences. A visit in April by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who Beijing brands a separatist, to a region controlled by India but claimed by China also stoked tensions between the two countries. The Indian government has since taken steps to cool tensions, rejecting an Australian request to take part in joint naval exercises with the United States and Japan last month to avoid agonising China. Modi is expected to visit China in September to attend a summit of the BRICS nations, which groups Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
